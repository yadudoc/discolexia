Investigators\nare invited to submit reports of original research in all areas of\nbasic virology, including biochemistry, biophysics, genetics, im-\nmunology, morphology, and physiology. The Journal is issued\nmonthly, two volumes per year.

Submit manuscripts in dupli-\ncate (original and one carbon) to ASM Publica-\ntions office, 1913 I St., N.W., Washington, D.C.\n20006.\nGeneral policy. Any manuscript submitted must\nbe a report of unpublished original research, which\nis not being considered for publication elsewhere.\nA manuscript accepted and published by the\nJournal must not be published again in any form\nwithout the consent of ASM.\nA charge of $25 per printed page is assessed for\npublication in the Journal. Most institutions and\ngranting agencies in the United States permit the\npayment of publication charges as part of their\ngeneral research support. It is recognized, how-\never, that such funds are not always available to\nlaboratories outside the United States. In such\ncases, the cost of publication will be borne by the\nAmerican Society for Microbiology. Ability or in-\nability to pay the publication charge is not a factor\nin the selection of manuscripts for publication.\nThe \"editorial style\" of the Journal essentially\nfollows the Style Manual for Biological Journals\n(2nd ed., AIBS, 1964). \"Instructions\" published\nin the Journal of Bacteriology apply also to the\nJournal of Virology. Biochemical abbreviations\nand nomenclature should essentially follow \"Bio-\nchemical Nomenclature\"\nin Handbook\nof Bio-\nchemistry (2nd ed., 1970, H. A. Sober, ed., The\nChemical Rubber Co., Cleveland,\np. A4-A24).\nNormally, abbreviations (except those of standard\nunits of measurement and symbols of the elements)\nshould be defined and introduced parenthetically\nat first use in the text. Genetic symbols should es-\nsentially follow the recommendations of Demerec\net\nal.\n(Genetics\n54:61,\n1966). Enzyme activity\nshould be expressed in terms of international units\n(Enzyme Nomenclature, Elsevier Publishing Co.,\n1965), and the EC number should be given paren-\nthetically at first use in the text. In expressing\nlengths, weights, and volumes, the prefixes nano\n(n) and pico (p) should be used instead of milli-\nmicro (m,) and micromicro (,u). Express lengths\nin nanometers (nm; 10-9 m) or in micrometers\n(,um; 10-6 m) instead of millimicrons (mp; 10-9 m),\nmicrons (,A; 10-6 m), or Angstroms (A; 10i-i\nm).\nExpress parts per million (ppm) as micrograms\nper milliliter (,ug/ml), micrograms per gram (ug/g),\nor microliters per liter (uliters/liter), as appropri-\nate. In general, measurements should be expressed\nin terms of standard international metric units.\nThe Journal reserves the privilege of editing man-\nuscripts to make them conform with the adopted\nstyle.\nForm of manuscript. All parts of the manuscript\nshould\nbe typed\ndouble-space\nor,\npreferably,\ntriple-space..Iost manuscripts can and should be\ndivided into the following sections: Abstract, In-\ntroduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Dis-\ncussion, Acknowledgments, and Literature Cited.\nOnly one weight of heading (paragraph lead-in)\nshould be used within each section.\nAbstract. An Abstract appears at the beginning\nof each paper in the Journal. The Abstract should\nnot exceed 250 words.\nLiterature Cited. In the text, references are cited\nby number. The Literature Cited section should\nbe typed in alphabetical order, by first author, and\nnumbered. Names of journals are abbreviated ac-\ncording to Access (American Chemical Society,\n1969). Literature citations should be restricted to\nclosely pertinent papers. Citations of abstracts,\ntheses, \"unpublished data,\" \"personal communi-\ncation,\" and \"in press\" will not be accepted in\nthe Literature Cited, but may be used parentheti-\ncally in the text.\nTables. Each table should be typed on a sepa-\nrate page. The data should be arranged so that\ncolumns of like material read down, not across.\nThe headings should be sufficiently clear so that\nthe meaning of the data will be understandable\nwithout reference to the text. Explanatory foot-\nnotes are permitted, but detailed descriptions of\nthe experiments are not. The materials and meth-\nods used to gain the data should properly remain\nin the section of that name.\nFigures. A complete set of figures, preferably\nglossy photographs, should accompany each of the\ntwo copies of the manuscript. Each figure should\nbe numbered and should include the name of the\nauthor, either in the margin or on the back\n(marked lightly with a soft pencil). Graphs (sub-\nmit as photographs) should be finished drawings\nnot needing further artwork or type-setting. Ab-\nsolutely no part of a graph should be typewritten\n(except the legend, which should be typed on a\nseparate page). All lettering should be done with\na lettering set. Most graphs will be reduced to one-\ncolumn width, and all elements in the drawing\nshould be prepared to withstand this reduction.\nThe legend of the figure should provide enough\ninformation so that the figure is understandable\nwithout reference to the text. Experimental de-\ntails from Materials and Methods should not be\nrepeated in figure legends.\nNotes. The accepted form for Notes is somewhat\ndifferent from the foregoing. Contributors should\nconsult a recent issue of the Journal for style.\nNotes should not exceed 500 words. The Abstract\nshould not exceed 25 words.\nNomenclature of viruses. Viruses named after a\ndisease should be written as separate words in\nlower-case roman, except when the name of the\ndisease\nis derived from a proper noun: herpes\nsimplex virus, measles virus, Newcastle disease\nvirus, poliomyelitis virus, varicella-zoster virus,\nvaccinia virus.\nMost other viruses should be written as a single\nword in lower case: adenovirus, coxsackievirus,\ncytomegalovirus, echovirus, herpesvirus, mengo-\nvirus, picornavirus, poliovirus, poxvirus.\nCopyright. Once a paper has been published in\nthe Journal, which is a copyrighted publication,\nthe legal ownership of all parts of the paper, in-\ncluding the illustrations, has passed from the\nauthor to the Journal. If the same author, or any\nauthor, wishes to republish material previously\npublished in the Journal, he must first receive\nwritten permission from ASM.\nReprints. Reprints (in multiples of 100) will be\nfurnished contributors when ordered in advance.\nA table showing the cost of reprints, and an order\nform, will be sent with the proof.\n", "path": "/local/scratch/dcaa11c2-0e48-487f-be86-877891c65a92/JVIv9i2_10_1128_jvi_1972_9_issue_2-20240609112325-4120541/jvi.1972.9.issue-2/jvi.1972.9.issue-2/admin.pdf", "metadata": {"title": "", "authors": "", "creationdate": "D:20032030132012", "keywords": "", "doi": "", "producer": "Apex PDFWriter", "format": "PDF 1.3", "first_page": "JjOURNAL OF VIROLOGY\nVOLUME 9\n* NUMBER 2\n* FEBRUARY 1972\nEDITORIAL BOARD\nRobert R.
