The bundle-forming pilus (BFP) of EPEC is an established\nvirulence factor encoded on the EPEC adherence factor plasmid (EAF) and has been implicated in both\nlocalized adherence to host cells and bacterial autoaggregation. We investigated the role of BFP in the ability\nof EPEC binding to kill host epithelial cells. BFP-expressing strains killed all three cell lines tested, comprising\nHEp-2 (laryngeal), HeLa (cervical), and Caco-2 (colonic) cells. Analysis of phosphatidylserine expression,\ninternucleosomal cleavage of host cell DNA, and morphological changes detected by electron microscopy\nindicated evidence of apoptosis. The extent of cell death was signi\ufb01cantly greater for BFP-expressing strains,\nincluding E2348/69, a wild-type clinical isolate, as well as for a laboratory strain, HB101, transformed with a\nbfp-carrying plasmid. Strains which did not express BFP induced signi\ufb01cantly less cell death, including a bfpA\ndisruptional mutant of E2348/69, EAF plasmid-cured E2348/69, HB101, and HB101 complemented with the\nlocus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island. These results indicate a direct correlation between BFP\nexpression and induction of cell death, including apoptosis, an event which may involve the targeting of host\ncell membrane phosphatidylethanolamine.\nEnteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) associated with\nsevere infantile diarrhea represents a major health problem\namong infants, particularly in developing countries (37). Re-\nsearch using cultured epithelial cells indicates that EPEC at-\ntaches to host cells initially in a loose manner and then con-\nsolidates attachment in a more intimate manner (17). The\ninitial adherence phenotype, characterized in tissue culture\nassays as localized adherence, is associated with the production\nof plasmid-encoded type IV \ufb01mbriae known as bundle-forming\npili (BFP) (15, 21). More intimate attachment, characterized\nby the development of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions of\nthe brush border microvilli, is encoded in a chromosomal re-\ngion termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) (32).\nRecent studies with pediatric intestinal biopsy samples have\nminimized the role of BFP in host adhesion and have alterna-\ntively implicated BFP in the formation of bacterial aggregates\nwhich produce the localized adherence pattern typical of\nEPEC infection (25). Nevertheless, studies with volunteers\nwho have ingested BFP-expressing and non-BFP-expressing\nEPEC strains have con\ufb01rmed BFP as a virulence factor (5).\nAttachment of EPEC to the host cell is accompanied by a\nnumber of signal transduction events, including release of ino-\nsitol triphosphate and calcium, phosphorylation of myosin light\nchain, and activation of protein kinase C (10, 18). EPEC also\nsynthesizes and translocates into the host cell a protein known\nas translocated intimin receptor (Tir), which after tyrosine\nphosphorylation permits intimate attachment through the bac-\nterial protein intimin (41). Recently, we and others have re-\nported that EPEC also induces cell death in cultured epithelial\ncells (2, 3, 11). Evidence of both apoptosis and necrosis has\nbeen observed. However, the bacterial structures responsible\nfor the triggering of these cell death pathways have not been\nidenti\ufb01ed. In this study, we demonstrate a role for BFP in the\ninduction of cell death, including apoptosis, in host epithelial\ncells.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and cultivation conditions. The characteristics of bacterial\nstrains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The E2348/69 derivatives 31-6-\n1(1),\nJPN\n15,\nand\nE2348/69(pOG127)\nas\nwell\nas\nHB101pMAR7\nand\nHB101(pCVD426) were kindly provided by J. Kaper, University of Maryland.\n31-6-1(1) is a previously described mutant of E2348/69 with a TnphoA insertion\nin the bfpA gene of the pMAR2 (60 MDA virulence plasmid from E2348/69)\nplasmid (14, 15). JPN15 is an E2348/69 derivative cured of plasmid pMAR2\nduring passage through a volunteer (27). The plasmid pOG127 (pMAR2 plasmid\nwith a perA::cat mutation) was transferred to strain JPN15 to generate E2348/\n69(pOG127). Since Per (plasmid-encoded regulator) regulates bfp expression,\nthis strain expresses BFP at lower levels than E2348/69. CVD206 is an eae mutant\nof E2348/69 constructed using a suicide vector with a pir-dependent R6K repli-\ncon and the sacB gene of Bacillus subtilis (16). HB101(pMAR7) is an avirulent\nlaboratory strain, HB101, complemented with pMAR7 plasmid (an ampicillin-\nresistant derivative of the EPEC adherence factor [EAF] plasmid) which con-\ntains the bfp gene (23). HB101(pCVD426) is complemented with pCVD426\ngenerated by cloning the entire LEE region from E2348/69 into the cosmid\nvector pCVD551 (33). Bacteria were stored in tryptic soy broth containing 20%\n(vol/vol) glycerol at \u000270\u00b0C. Prior to use, bacteria were cultured on Trypticase soy\nagar with 5% de\ufb01brinated sheep blood supplemented with the appropriate an-\n* Corresponding author.

Bacterial expression of BFP was assessed by\nWestern blotting using a polyclonal anti-BFP antiserum (generous gift of J.\nGiron, Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico) as previously de-\nscribed (21). After overnight growth, the bacteria were harvested, washed once\nwith antibiotic-free cell culture medium, and resuspended in the epithelial cell\nculture medium as indicated below.\nCell culture. The human epithelial cells HEp-2 (human laryngeal cell line),\nHeLa (human cervical cell line), and Caco-2 (human colonic cell line) were\nobtained from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. HEp-2 and\nHeLa cells were grown in minimum essential medium (Gibco Laboratories,\nGrand Island, N.Y.) supplemented with decomplemented 10% fetal calf serum\n(Cansera International Inc.), 0.5% L-glutamine (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa\nMesa, Calif.), 0.1% sodium bicarbonate (ICN), and 0.1% gentamycin at 37\u00b0C in\n5% CO2. The human colonic Caco-2 cells were grown in minimum essential\nmedium with Earl\u2019s salts (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 0.5% L-glutamine,\nnonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.1% gentamycin (Gibco\nBRL) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.\nAssessment of outer lea\ufb02et levels of PS. The level of outer lea\ufb02et phosphati-\ndylserine (PS) on cells incubated with media or bacteria was determined by \ufb02ow\ncytometry following treatment with \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated an-\nnexin V (annexin V-FITC; Pharmingen International, Mississauga, Ontario,\nCanada) according to the method of Vermes et al. (44). Approximately 106 cells\n(70% con\ufb02uent monolayer) were infected with 108 bacteria in culture medium\nwithout antibiotics for 5 to 18 h at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. After incubation,\nboth detached (supernatant) and adherent (trypsinized) cells were harvested and\nthe nonadherent bacteria were removed by centrifugation (260 \u0003 g for 10 min at\n4\u00b0C) after mixing with isotonic solution of 15% sucrose in phosphate-buffered\nsaline. The pellets were then resuspended in 100 \u0004l of binding buffer (10 mM\nHEPES, 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4), and thereafter 5 \u0004l of\nannexin V-FITC (Pharmingen) was added to each tube. The samples were then\nincubated at room temperature for 20 to 30 min, mixed with 400 \u0004l of binding\nbuffer, screened, and supplemented with 0.5 \u0004g of propidium iodide (PI)\n(Pharmingen) prior to \ufb02ow cytometric analysis. An increase in outer lea\ufb02et PS,\ndetected by annexin V-FITC, provides an indication of apoptosis and necrosis.\nCells which are late apoptotic or necrotic lose membrane integrity and will stain\nwith both annexin V-FITC and PI. Cells which retain membrane integrity, in-\ncluding viable and early apoptotic cells, will not take up PI. Therefore, the\ncombined use of annexin V-FITC and PI can distinguish between early apoptotic\nand late apoptotic or necrotic cells (24). To assess the effect of anti-BFP on\nEPEC induction of cell death, E2348/69 was preincubated with equivalent con-\ncentrations of either rabbit anti-BFP or rabbit nonimmune serum for 45 min at\nroom temperature followed by incubation with HEp-2 cells per the standard\nprotocol. Cell death was analyzed by \ufb02ow cytometry as described above.\nElectron microscopic analysis of cell death. Cell death was analyzed by elec-\ntron microscopy as previously described (3). Subcon\ufb02uent monolayers of all\nthree cell lines were incubated with media or bacteria (108) for 5 h and were then\nanalyzed by electron microscopy for morphological changes indicative of necrosis\nor apoptosis. Verotoxin 1 (VT1) treatment was used as a control for induction of\napoptosis. Cells which express outer lea\ufb02et Gb3 have been shown to be sensitive\nto VT-induced apoptosis (28, 43). In all cases, trypsinized cell monolayers and\ndetached cells (supernatant) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline,\ngently overlayed with 1 ml of universal \ufb01xative (equal parts of formaldehyde and\n1% glutaraldehyde), and post\ufb01xed in 2% osmium tetroxide. Dehydration was\ncarried out in graded ethanol, followed by propylene oxide and embedding in\nEpon. One-micrometer-thick sections were stained with toluidine blue and lead\ncitrate. Electron microscopic examination was conducted using a Philips 201\n(N. V. Philips, Gloeilampenfabrieken, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) transmis-\nsion electron microscope.\nAnalysis of internucleosomal fragmentation. Analysis of DNA fragmentation\nwas carried out as previously described (3). Briefy, all trypsinized cells and those\nfrom supernatants were harvested by centrifugation and gently lysed with hypo-\ntonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100) on ice\nfor 10 min. After 10 min of centrifugation at 13,700 \u0003 g and 4\u00b0C, the superna-\ntants were mixed well with an equal volume of 1:1 phenol-chloroform and\nrecentrifuged. After transfer, the upper phases containing DNA were incubated\nwith 1 \u0004g of glycogen, and a 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and 1 ml of\nabsolute ethanol were added and incubated at \u000220\u00b0C overnight. The DNA was\npelleted by centrifugation (14,000 \u0003 g for 20 min) at 4\u00b0C, washed once with 70%\nethanol, and air dried at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA pellets were\ndissolved in 10 \u0004l of Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA),\nmixed with 12 \u0004l of RNase (20 \u0004g/ml in Tris-EDTA), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for\n30 min. Samples were incubated with 3 \u0004l of loading buffer (50 mM EDTA, 15%\n[wt/vol] Ficoll, 0.25% [wt/vol] bromophenol blue) at 65\u00b0C for 15 min and elec-\ntrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel at 50 V for 90 min.\nBacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. Bacterial binding to epithelial cells was\nassayed as previously described (3). Approximately 108 bacteria were incubated\nwith 106 cells (70 to 80% con\ufb02uent monolayer) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. After incubation\nwith bacteria, both detached and adherent (trypsinized) cells were harvested and\nseparated from nonadherent bacteria by centrifugation through an isotonic 15%\nsucrose solution. Bacterial binding was detected using a polyclonal anti-E. coli\n(all antigens) antibody (Virostat) and a goat anti-rabbit\u2013FITC conjugate (Sigma)\nand quanti\ufb01ed by \ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using a Becton\nDickinson FACSscan \ufb02ow cytometer. All samples were analyzed with Cell Quest\nsoftware. Histogram plots showing cell count versus \ufb02uorescence intensity are\nprovided.\nRESULTS\nEffect of BFP expression on host cell morphology. Electron\nmicroscopic analysis of epithelial cell morphology indicated a\ncorrelation between BFP expression and the extent of apopto-\nsis and necrosis. Western blot analysis con\ufb01rmed expression of\nBFP for all bfp-positive strains and lack of expression for all\nbfp-negative strains (data not shown). Evidence of apoptosis\nincluded membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and mar-\ngination. Necrotic cells, on the other hand, were typically\nlarger and lighter, with plasma membrane lesions and mito-\nchondrial abnormalities. For both HeLa (Fig. 1) and Caco-2\n(Fig. 2) cells, all BFP-expressing strains, including E2348/69,\nHB101(pMAR7), and E2348/69(pOG127), induced consis-\ntently signi\ufb01cantly higher levels of apoptosis and necrosis than\nthose produced by incubation with the corresponding BFP-\nnegative strains, 31-6-1(1), HB101, and JPN15, respectively\n(P \u0005 0.05). Even CVD206, which expresses BFP but not in-\ntimin, triggered higher levels of cell death than did the BFP-\nnegative strains, although the levels were somewhat lower than\nTABLE 1.

Untreated cells\nshowed less than 5% apoptosis and necrosis combined (not\nshown). Overnight treatment of HeLa cells with VT1 induced\nlevels of cell death similar to those for the BFP-expressing\nstrains. Caco-2 cells, which have been reported to express\nlower levels of plasma membrane VT receptor (28) and should\ntherefore be less sensitive to VT1 treatment, showed lower\nlevels of cell death in response to overnight VT1 treatment.\nHeLa cells express higher levels of membrane VT receptor\n(26) and were indeed more sensitive to VT-induced cell death.\nEffect of BFP expression on host cell outer lea\ufb02et PS. Flow\ncytometric analysis of three cell lines infected with various E.\ncoli strains resulted in increased outer lea\ufb02et PS levels after\ntreatment with any of the BFP-expressing strains tested. Figure\n3 shows the histogram plots of annexin V-FITC staining (to\ndetect outer lea\ufb02et PS) for HEp-2, Caco-2, and HeLa cells\ntreated with BFP-positive strains and the corresponding BFP-\nnegative strains. In each case, treatment with the BFP-express-\ning strains [E2348/69, E2348/69(pOG127), and HB101(pMAR7)]\nresulted in elevated outer lea\ufb02et PS levels compared to treat-\nment with the non-BFP-expressing strains [31-6-1(1), JPN15,\nand HB101]. HB101(pCVD426), which expresses the intimin\nadhesin but not BFP, showed PS levels identical to those for\nHB101 (see Fig. 7). Treatment with sterile \ufb01ltered superna-\ntants resulted in PS levels similar to those of untreated cells\n(not shown). Preincubation of EPEC with anti-BFP reduced\nthe level of cell death relative to controls with either no anti-\nserum or equivalent concentrations of rabbit nonimmune se-\nrum (Table 2). At a concentration of 0.89 mg of anti-BFP per\nml, cell viability was increased to 65%, over that with no anti-\nserum (43%) or rabbit nonimmune serum (50%).\nEffect of BFP expression on DNA fragmentation. Agarose\ngel electrophoresis of cellular DNA showed evidence of inter-\nnucleosomal DNA fragmentation in all cell lines infected with\nthe BFP-expressing strains E2348/69, HB101(pMAR7), and\nE2348/69(pOG127). Figure 4 shows the electrophoretic result\nof extracted DNA from HeLa cells and clearly indicates DNA\ndegradation after a 5-h incubation with HB101(pMAR7),\nE2348/69(pOG127), and E2348/69 and overnight treatment\nwith VT1. Some DNA degradation was also observed with\nCVD206. No such degradation was observed when HeLa cells\nwere untreated or incubated with HB101, JPN15, or 31-6-1(1).\nSimilar results were achieved using Caco-2 and HEp-2 cells\n(not shown). These DNA patterns, although not the typical\nladders generated by other apoptosis-inducing agents, are con-\nsistent with those reported for other apoptosis-inducing bac-\nteria (11) and likely represent the mixed apoptosis-necrosis\nindicated by the electron microscope and \ufb02ow cytometry re-\nsults in this study. Furthermore, others have reported that\ncleavage of internucleosomal DNA in epithelial cells may be\ndefective, resulting in less distinctive DNA fragmentation pat-\nterns (38).\nRelative contributions of bfp and eae. In order to assess the\nrelative contributions of bfp and eae genes to cell death, we\ncompared treatment with wild-type EPEC E2348/69 and the\neae-negative mutant and bfp-negative mutant of E2348/69 and\nassessed by \ufb02ow cytometry the extent of apoptotic and necrotic\ncell death. Figure 5 shows the dot plots for four treatments of\nHeLa cells, comparing the intensity of annexin V-FITC stain-\ning with PI staining. Lower left quadrants re\ufb02ect percentages\nof viable cells (nonapoptotic, nonnecrotic cells; i.e., low levels\nof both annexin-FITC and PI). Lower right quadrants indicate\nFIG. 1.

IMMUN.\n\npercentages of early apoptotic cells while upper quadrants\n(elevated PI staining) re\ufb02ect cells in late apoptosis or necrosis.\nTreatment with E2348/69 showed increased numbers of both\napoptotic and necrotic cells relative to the untreated sample.\nDisruption of the bfp gene in 31-6-1(1) reduced the percentage\nof early apoptotic cells to that of the untreated sample. The\nlevel of late apoptosis or necrosis was also diminished with the\nbfp-negative mutant. Disruption of the eae gene in CVD206\nresulted in levels of early apoptosis similar to that for the wild\ntype, E2348/69, but with markedly less necrosis and late apo-\nptosis. This result suggests that BFP may be important in the\ninduction of apoptosis while intimin may play a more signi\ufb01-\ncant role in the induction of necrosis. Certainly, the reduction\nof early apoptosis to background levels with the bfp mutant and\nthe maintenance of wild-type levels of early apoptosis with the\neae mutant support the involvement of BFP but not intimin in\nthe induction of apoptosis. Since the upper quadrant likely\nincludes cells which have undergone apoptosis and eventually\nlost membrane integrity as well as those cells which have pro-\nceeded through a necrotic pathway, it is not possible to de\ufb01n-\nitively assign apoptosis and necrosis induction roles.\nBacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. Consistent with previ-\nous reports, BFP expression correlated with adhesion to cul-\ntured epithelial cells (Fig. 6). BFP-expressing strains generally\nadhered better to both HeLa (shown) and Caco-2 (not shown)\ncells than did the non-BFP-expressing correlates. HB101\n(pMAR7) adhered better to HeLa cells than did HB101\n(pCVD426) (Fig. 6D), which adhered only slightly better than\nHB101, but only HB101(pMAR7) was capable of inducing\nsigni\ufb01cant levels of cell death (Fig. 7).\nDISCUSSION\nBacterial colonization and infection of various tissues is the\nresult of recognition by bacterial adhesins of speci\ufb01c receptors\non the target tissue. Once the microorganism approaches the\nhost cell surface, it is essential for the pathogen to use its full\ngenetic potential for attachment and the synthesis of other\ntraits to secure a speci\ufb01c niche within the host that will permit\nits replication and survival. Accordingly, the induction of host\ncell death may represent a strategy developed by microorgan-\nisms to ensure their survival, infection, and invasion of the\ntarget tissue.\nInduction of host cell death has been reported for several\ngastrointestinal pathogens, including Yersinia (34), Salmonella\n(35), Shigella (47, 48), Helicobacter pylori (36), and enterohe-\nmorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (3). EPEC infection has been re-\nported to cause pathological damage of the target tissue; how-\never, features of apoptotic cell death were not indicated (20,\n42). Evidence of EPEC-induced apoptotic and necrotic cell\ndeath has been reported for cell lines including HEp-2, T84,\nCaco-2, and HeLa cells (3, 11).\nOur investigation of the cell death triggered by E. coli strains\nindicates a role for BFP in the induction of apoptosis. Flow\ncytometric analysis showed that the epithelial cell apoptosis\nwas much greater with any of the BFP-expressing E. coli strains\nFIG. 2.

Using PS exposure as a\nmarker of apoptosis, we tested treatment of HEp-2, Caco-2,\nand HeLa cells with various BPF\u0001 and BFP\u0002 strains. In all\ncases, the BFP-expressing strains induced elevated levels of\napoptosis over their non-BFP-expressing correlates. Interest-\ningly, HEp-2 and HeLa cells showed signi\ufb01cant induction of\napoptosis after incubation with HB101(pMAR7) in contrast to\nother BFP\u0001 strains. This may be a consequence of interference\nby lipopolysaccharide or type 1 \ufb01mbriae expressed by wild-type\nE2348/69 and E2348/69(pOG127) strains but not by HB101.\nThis is consistent with other reports that lipopolysaccharide\nFIG. 3.

Treat-\nment with sterile \ufb01ltered supernatants resulted in background\nlevels of cell death (5%) found in untreated cells. In all cases,\nBFP-expressing strains induced signi\ufb01cantly higher levels of\ncell death and showed higher levels of adhesion to the same\ncell lines. Levels of adhesion were consistent with the ability to\ninduce apoptosis with HB101(pMAR7)- and E2348/69-in-\nfected cells showing the highest levels of both adhesion and\napoptosis. The absence of the BFP adhesion appeared to have\na more profound effect on induction of cell death than did the\nabsence of other adhesins such as intimin (in strain CVD206).\nPreincubation with anti-BFP at concentrations which have\nbeen shown to reduce EPEC adhesion (21) was also found to\ninhibit EPEC induction of cell death.\nAnalysis of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation con\ufb01rmed\nthe induction of apoptosis by the BFP-expressing strains. Elec-\ntron microscopic analysis of Caco-2 and HeLa cell lines incu-\nbated with BFP-expressing E. coli strains also shows a clear\nincrease in both apoptotic and necrotic cells in contrast to the\nBFP-negative strains.\nThrough a double labeling experiment with annexin V-FITC\nand PI, we were able to distinguish between early apoptotic\nand late apoptotic or necrotic cells. In this analysis, HeLa cells\ntreated\nwith\nE2348/69,\n31-6-1(1),\nand\nthe\neae-de\ufb01cient\nCVD206 strain revealed that the eae mutant strain induced\nhigher levels of apoptosis and less necrosis than the wild-type\nparent strain. This has also been observed with the T84 cell line\n(data not shown). Ablation of the bfp gene in strain 31-6-1(1),\nwhich still expresses intimin, reduced the level of early apo-\nptotic cells to that of untreated cells. However, as we have\npreviously noted, the detection of necrosis in vitro may not be\nphysiological, since nonphagocytosed apoptotic cells may even-\ntually lose their membrane intregrity and appear necrotic (3).\nConsequently, while we note differences in the relative levels of\napoptosis and necrosis, we have focused primarily on the ex-\ntent of apoptosis triggered by bacterial binding.\nA recent study has implicated the secreted virulence factor\nEspF in host cell death triggered by EPEC (12).

IMMUN.\n\nof cell death, like that of the EPEC adhesion mechanism, is a\nmultifactorial event involving several virulence factors includ-\ning EspF and BFP.\nInduction of apoptosis by BFP-expressing strains may be\nrelated to BFP receptor expression by the host cell. We have\npreviously demonstrated using thin-layer chromatography and\nliposome assays that EPEC recognizes phosphatidylethano-\nlamine (PE) in a speci\ufb01c and dose-dependent manner and that\nadhesion to human epithelial cells is inhibitable by anti-PE (4).\nWe have also found that BFP expression correlates with PE\nrecognition (28a), which when considered together with the\npresent \ufb01ndings suggests that bacterial binding to host mem-\nbrane PE may play a role in the induction of apoptosis. All cell\nlines tested in this study expressed PE. Variations in the level\nof plasma membrane outer lea\ufb02et PE may explain differences\nin the extent of apoptosis induced in different cell lines. We\nhave shown that augmentation of outer lea\ufb02et PE levels\nthrough PE-liposome uptake by epithelial cells does increase\nbacterial binding, which in turn increases exposure of the ap-\noptotic marker PS (3).\nThe ligation of membrane PE by BFP-expressing EPEC may\ntrigger downstream events involving key mediators of apopto-\nsis, including ceramide. Ceramide levels may be increased\nthrough the inhibition of ceramide acylation. A phospholipase\nA2-like transacylase transfers an acyl group from PE to cer-\namide (1). Therefore, bacterial binding to host PE receptors\nmay reduce the PE pool, restrict this reaction, and elevate\nceramide levels. PE is also a substrate of phospholipase D,\nwhich catalyzes the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA) (29,\n45) which plays a pivotal role in the balance of mitogenic and\napoptotic responses. Sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phos-\nphate increase intracellular levels of PA, thereby stimulating\nmitogenesis, while ceramide inhibits phospholipase D activa-\ntion, thereby decreasing PA levels and enhancing the apoptotic\nresponse (22). The selective ligation of membrane PE by BFP-\nexpressing EPEC could reduce the availability of PE for phos-\npholipase D-mediated hydrolysis, resulting in reduced levels of\ncytosolic PA and disrupting the mitogen signaling cascade.\nBacterial induction of apoptosis could lead to a further reduc-\ntion in cytosolic exposure of PE, thereby enhancing this effect.\nBFP binding to host membrane PE may also contribute to\nmembrane events associated with apoptosis. PE is a nonbilayer\nphospholipid which has a high tendency to form the HII in-\nverted micelle phase (7, 13). Therefore, PE-rich membranes\ntend to exert bending \ufb02uctuations (8) and therefore to pro-\nmote physical membrane changes, including membrane fusion,\ninward membrane bending, and membrane budding. These\nchanges may affect membrane permeability, endocytosis, cell\ndivision, and cell budding associated with the formation of\napoptotic bodies. The importance of membrane PE is empha-\nsized by \ufb01ndings which show that lowering the PE content\ndiminished cell death during simulated ischemia and reperfu-\nsion (40). Therefore, events which sequester membrane PE,\nincluding bacterial binding, may contribute to apoptotic mem-\nbrane changes. Further study is required to determine the\nmechanism by which bacterial ligation of host cell PE contrib-\nutes to the induction of host cell death.\nWe have also reported that EHEC, another A/E gastroin-\ntestinal pathogen, binds PE and that EHEC binding to two\nepithelial cell lines correlates with plasma membrane outer\nlea\ufb02et levels of PE (4). Furthermore, EHEC, in a similar\nmanner to EPEC, induces apoptosis in a number of epithelial\ncell lines, which results in increased outer lea\ufb02et PE and bac-\nterial binding (3). The mechanism by which EHEC induces\napoptosis is unknown. It may be that EHEC also expresses a\nBFP-like pilus which may mediate host cell PE binding and\napoptosis. Interestingly, a mutation in the ler (LEE-encoded\nregulator) gene of EHEC resulted in the expression of an\nunidenti\ufb01ed pilus and also enhanced epithelial cell adhesion\n(19).\nIn conclusion, these results clearly indicate a direct correla-\ntion between BFP expression and the induction of host cell\ndeath including apoptosis. BFP, an established EPEC viru-\nlence factor, has been previously implicated in initial host cell\nattachment and in bacterial autoaggregation. These \ufb01ndings\nnow de\ufb01ne another role for BFP in the pathogenesis of EPEC\ninfection. Our earlier work has proposed that the induction of\napoptosis by EPEC and EHEC provides a bacterial advantage\nby augmenting outer lea\ufb02et levels of the PE receptor candidate\n(3). Although apoptotic cells are eventually phagocytosed in\nvivo, receptor ampli\ufb01cation through apoptosis can offer a tem-\nporary adhesion advantage to the bacterium. Other advantages\nmay include enhanced access to nutrients and to the subepi-\nthelial layer. It has been suggested that apoptosis of epithelial\ncells triggered by Pseudomonas aeruginosa may serve as a ve-\nhicle for clearance and bacterial dissemination (39, 46). Alter-\nnatively, cell death may function as a host mechanism to limit\nbacterial infection. EPEC also stimulates a number of anti-\napoptotic pathways within the cell and it has been suggested\nthat EPEC has developed strategies to slow host cell killing\n(10). It may be that the coordination of these apoptotic and\nantiapoptotic signaling events in the host cell by the bacterium\nultimately determines the infection outcome.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by grants from the Crohn\u2019s and Colitis\nFoundation of Canada (to D.E.B.F.) and the Medical Research Coun-\ncil of Canada (MT 13073) (to C.A.L.).\nREFERENCES\n1.

The bundle-forming pilus (BFP) of EPEC is an established\nvirulence factor encoded on the EPEC adherence factor plasmid (EAF) and has been implicated in both\nlocalized adherence to host cells and bacterial autoaggregation. We investigated the role of BFP in the ability\nof EPEC binding to kill host epithelial cells. BFP-expressing strains killed all three cell lines tested, comprising\nHEp-2 (laryngeal), HeLa (cervical), and Caco-2 (colonic) cells. Analysis of phosphatidylserine expression,\ninternucleosomal cleavage of host cell DNA, and morphological changes detected by electron microscopy\nindicated evidence of apoptosis. The extent of cell death was signi\ufb01cantly greater for BFP-expressing strains,\nincluding E2348/69, a wild-type clinical isolate, as well as for a laboratory strain, HB101, transformed with a\nbfp-carrying plasmid. Strains which did not express BFP induced signi\ufb01cantly less cell death, including a bfpA\ndisruptional mutant of E2348/69, EAF plasmid-cured E2348/69, HB101, and HB101 complemented with the\nlocus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island. These results indicate a direct correlation between BFP\nexpression and induction of cell death, including apoptosis, an event which may involve the targeting of host\ncell membrane phosphatidylethanolamine.\nEnteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) associated with\nsevere infantile diarrhea represents a major health problem\namong infants, particularly in developing countries (37). Re-\nsearch using cultured epithelial cells indicates that EPEC at-\ntaches to host cells initially in a loose manner and then con-\nsolidates attachment in a more intimate manner (17). The\ninitial adherence phenotype, characterized in tissue culture\nassays as localized adherence, is associated with the production\nof plasmid-encoded type IV \ufb01mbriae known as bundle-forming\npili (BFP) (15, 21). More intimate attachment, characterized\nby the development of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions of\nthe brush border microvilli, is encoded in a chromosomal re-\ngion termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) (32).\nRecent studies with pediatric intestinal biopsy samples have\nminimized the role of BFP in host adhesion and have alterna-\ntively implicated BFP in the formation of bacterial aggregates\nwhich produce the localized adherence pattern typical of\nEPEC infection (25). Nevertheless, studies with volunteers\nwho have ingested BFP-expressing and non-BFP-expressing\nEPEC strains have con\ufb01rmed BFP as a virulence factor (5).\nAttachment of EPEC to the host cell is accompanied by a\nnumber of signal transduction events, including release of ino-\nsitol triphosphate and calcium, phosphorylation of myosin light\nchain, and activation of protein kinase C (10, 18). EPEC also\nsynthesizes and translocates into the host cell a protein known\nas translocated intimin receptor (Tir), which after tyrosine\nphosphorylation permits intimate attachment through the bac-\nterial protein intimin (41). Recently, we and others have re-\nported that EPEC also induces cell death in cultured epithelial\ncells (2, 3, 11). Evidence of both apoptosis and necrosis has\nbeen observed. However, the bacterial structures responsible\nfor the triggering of these cell death pathways have not been\nidenti\ufb01ed. In this study, we demonstrate a role for BFP in the\ninduction of cell death, including apoptosis, in host epithelial\ncells.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and cultivation conditions. The characteristics of bacterial\nstrains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The E2348/69 derivatives 31-6-\n1(1),\nJPN\n15,\nand\nE2348/69(pOG127)\nas\nwell\nas\nHB101pMAR7\nand\nHB101(pCVD426) were kindly provided by J. Kaper, University of Maryland.\n31-6-1(1) is a previously described mutant of E2348/69 with a TnphoA insertion\nin the bfpA gene of the pMAR2 (60 MDA virulence plasmid from E2348/69)\nplasmid (14, 15). JPN15 is an E2348/69 derivative cured of plasmid pMAR2\nduring passage through a volunteer (27). The plasmid pOG127 (pMAR2 plasmid\nwith a perA::cat mutation) was transferred to strain JPN15 to generate E2348/\n69(pOG127). Since Per (plasmid-encoded regulator) regulates bfp expression,\nthis strain expresses BFP at lower levels than E2348/69. CVD206 is an eae mutant\nof E2348/69 constructed using a suicide vector with a pir-dependent R6K repli-\ncon and the sacB gene of Bacillus subtilis (16). HB101(pMAR7) is an avirulent\nlaboratory strain, HB101, complemented with pMAR7 plasmid (an ampicillin-\nresistant derivative of the EPEC adherence factor [EAF] plasmid) which con-\ntains the bfp gene (23). HB101(pCVD426) is complemented with pCVD426\ngenerated by cloning the entire LEE region from E2348/69 into the cosmid\nvector pCVD551 (33). Bacteria were stored in tryptic soy broth containing 20%\n(vol/vol) glycerol at \u000270\u00b0C. Prior to use, bacteria were cultured on Trypticase soy\nagar with 5% de\ufb01brinated sheep blood supplemented with the appropriate an-\n* Corresponding author.
