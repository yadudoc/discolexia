On the basis of the 23S rRNA gene sequences representing all of the S. enterica\nsubspecies and S. bongori, an 18-mer oligonucleotide probe was selected. The speci\ufb01city of the probe was tested\nby in situ hybridization to bacterial cell smears of pure cultures. Forty-nine of 55 tested Salmonella serovars\nbelonging to subspecies 1, 1I, 1IIb, 1V, and VI hybridized with the probe. The probe did not hybridize to serovars\nfrom subspecies 1IIa (S. arizonae) or to S. bongori. No cross-reaction to 64 other strains of the family\nEnterobacteriaceae or 18 other bacterial strains outside this family was observed. The probe was tested with\nsections of formalin-\ufb01xed, paraf\ufb01n-embedded tissue from experimentally infected mice or from animals with\na history of clinical salmonellosis. 1n these tissue sections the probe hybridized speci\ufb01cally to Salmonella\nserovars, allowing for the detection of single bacterial cells. The development of a \ufb02uorescence-labelled speci\ufb01c\noligonucleotide probe makes the FISH technique a promising tool for the rapid identi\ufb01cation of S. enterica in\nbacterial smears, as well as for the detection of S. enterica in histological tissue sections.\nDifferent serovars of Salmonella have long been recognized\nas major causes of infections in humans and animals, causing a\nvariety of clinical manifestations ranging from mild gastroen-\nteritis to severe sepsis (13). Clinical infection is often followed\nby a subclinical carrier state, in which the convalescing indi-\nvidual may continue to shed salmonellae in feces for a longer\nperiod (11).\nThe genus Salmonella can be divided into seven homology\ngroups by DNA-DNA hybridization studies (12, 19); however,\nthe genus is a large group with respect to antigenicity, consist-\ning of more than 2,300 described serovars (25). As DNA ho-\nmology group V diverges from the others, it has been proposed\nas a new species, Salmonella bongori (28). The remaining sub-\nspecies, subspecies 1, 1I, 1IIa, 1IIb, 1V, and VI, belong to the\nspecies Salmonella enterica. Subspecies 1 is the largest group,\nwith about 59% of the described Salmonella serovars (25),\nincluding all the clinically most relevant serovars (18).\nThe interactions of single bacterial strains in complex eco-\nlogical systems have been studied by \ufb02uorescence in situ hy-\nbridization (FISH) techniques. By hybridizing with \ufb02uores-\ncence-labelled oligonucleotide probes speci\ufb01cally targeting\nribosomes in Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium, the\nspatial distribution of bacteria in the intestinal \ufb02ora of strep-\ntomycin-treated mice has been established (20, 27). However,\nto be able to detect a broad range of clinically relevant Salmo-\nnella serovars by the FISH technique under natural conditions,\na genus-speci\ufb01c RNA-targeted probe is necessary. Such a\nprobe has so far not been available.\nThe ribosomal genes are universally distributed and contain\nhighly conserved regions as well as variable regions, toward\nwhich oligonucleotide probes with various speci\ufb01cities can be\ndeveloped (26, 32). 1n growing bacteria the gene is transcribed\ninto a high number of ribosomes, and following \ufb01xation these\ncan be used as targets for hybridization with short oligonucle-\notide probes (16). By end labelling such probes with \ufb02uores-\ncent molecules, single bacterial cells can be identi\ufb01ed by epi-\n\ufb02uorescence microscopy (14).\nThe purpose of this study was to generate a speci\ufb01c oligo-\nnucleotide probe targeting the different serovars of S. enterica\nby sequencing and aligning 23S rRNA gene sequences and to\nevaluate the applicability of the probe for FISH identi\ufb01cation of\nSalmonella in bacterial smears and detection in formalin-\ufb01xed,\nparaf\ufb01n-embedded specimens from animals with clinical Salmo-\nnella infections.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and culture methods. The strains used to test the speci\ufb01city\nof the oligonucleotide probe are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Salmonella strains were\neither type strains or clinical isolates identi\ufb01ed by serotyping at the Danish\nVeterinary Laboratory (DVL). Other representatives of the family Enterobacte-\nriaceae were type strains or clinical isolates identi\ufb01ed by using the API 20E\nsystem (bioMe\n\u00b4rieux, Marcy, France). Gram-positive test strains were all type\nstrains. The bacteria used to test probe speci\ufb01city and for sequencing were all\ncultured overnight at 37\u00b0C on blood agar (BA; CM331 [Oxoid] supplemented\nwith 5% bovine blood). The strains used to inoculate the experimentally infected\nmice were grown in nutrient broth (CM1 [Difco]) at 37\u00b0C overnight. Samples\nfrom lung and liver were plated on BA and Drigalski agar (17), and the plates\nwere incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C.\nFixation of bacteria for smear hybridization. A single colony from an over-\nnight culture was picked and resuspended in 800 ml of 10% buffered formalin,\nand the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The bacteria were\npelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 3 g for 5 min, washed in 500 ml of 0.1%\nNonidet P-40 (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.), and resuspended in a 1:1 mix-\nture of a storage buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and 96%\nethanol. The \ufb01xed bacteria were stored at 220\u00b0C until use.\nSequencing of rRNA genes of the bacteria. S. typhimurium DVL 3389-1,\nProteus mirabilis SN157, and Citrobacter amalonaticus UX31 were used for par-\ntial sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene. For each isolate a single colony was\npicked and the bacteria were washed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (140\n* Corresponding author.

The bacteria were resuspended in 100 ml of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0],\n1 mM EDTA), lysed by boiling for 10 min, and immediately cooled on ice. The\nlysates were diluted 1:100 in double-distilled H2O (ddH2O), and 2 ml of this\nsolution was added to 50 ml of a PCR mixture consisting of 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM\nMgCl2, 10 pmol of each primer, 100 mM (each) dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP,\nand 0.5 U of polymerase (Amplitaq; Perkin-Elmer) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3).\nPrimers with homology to E. coli were used for PCR ampli\ufb01cation of a segment\nin the 23S rRNA gene; the forward primer, 59-TCAGAAGTGCGAATGC-39,\nwas located at position 1243 (E. coli numbering), and the reverse primer,\n59-AACTTACCCGACAAGG-39, was located at position 1941 (9). Ampli\ufb01ca-\ntion was carried out on a thermocycler, with initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min\nand subsequent ampli\ufb01cation for 34 cycles, with each cycle consisting of anneal-\ning at 45\u00b0C for 1 min, extension at 72\u00b0C for 2 min, and denaturation at 94\u00b0C for\n2 min. The 698-base PCR product was puri\ufb01ed by using QIAquick spin columns\n(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and\nwas veri\ufb01ed by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.\nThe nucleotide sequence of the PCR product was determined by cycle se-\nquencing (31) with an Amplitaq FS dye terminator kit and a 373A automatic\nDNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, Calif.) by using\nthe same primers used for the PCR ampli\ufb01cation. The segments were sequenced\ntwice in both directions.\nSelection of probe sequence. The sequences obtained were aligned with the\npublished E. coli 23S rrnB sequence (7), together with sequences from Salmo-\nnella serovars representing all subspecies (8, 10, 37), Yersinia enterocolitica (10),\nand Citrobacter freundii (10), by using the Sequence Navigator software (Applied\nBiosystems). An 18-mer oligonucleotide probe sequence complementary to the\nregion from positions 1713 to 1730 (E. coli numbering) was selected as being\nspeci\ufb01c for Salmonella subspecies 1, 1IIb, and VI. The theoretical speci\ufb01city was\nchecked by using the CHECK_PROBE program in the RDP Database (24) and\nin the EMBL database by using the Fasta search tool.\nOligonucleotide probes. A Salmonella oligonucleotide probe (Sal3; 59-AATC\nACTTCACCTACGTG-39) the universal bacterial probe (Eub338; 59-GCTGCC\nTCCCGTAGGAGT-39) (3), and a nonsense probe with a sequence complemen-\ntary to Eub338 (Non338; 59-CGACGGAGGGCATCCTCA-39) (35) were used.\nThe probes were all synthesized and labelled with \ufb02uorescein (Sal3 and Non338)\nor the red \ufb02uorescent dye Cy3 (Eub338) at the 59 end (Hobolth DNA syntese,\nHiller\u00f8d, Denmark). The systematic name of the salmonella probe was L-S-Sal-\n1713-a-A-18 (2); however, for reasons of simplicity it is designated Sal3 in this\nreport.\nWhole-cell hybridization. The speci\ufb01city of Sal3 was tested by hybridization\nwith whole bacterial cells. The universal bacterial probe Eub338 served as a\npositive control. Six-well Te\ufb02on-coated slides (NovaKemi, Enskede, Sweden)\nwere coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma Chemical) according to the manufactur-\ner\u2019s instructions. A 1-ml solution of \ufb01xed bacteria was spotted in the wells and air\ndried. Bacteria were dehydrated in 70 and 96% ethanol for 2 min at each\nconcentration. After drying, 8 ml of hybridization solution (0.7 M NaCl, 0.1 M\nTris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 mM EDTA) containing 5 ng\nof probe per ml was added, and the slide was placed in a moisture chamber and\nincubated for 3 h at 45\u00b0C. Washing was performed by immersing the slide gently\nin ddH2O, and this was followed by incubation in preheated hybridization buffer\nat 45\u00b0C for 20 min. Finally, the slide was rinsed in ddH2O and air dried. The\nslides were mounted in a phosphate-buffered (pH 8.5) medium; the medium\ncontained 20 mg of n-propyl gallate (Sigma Chemical) per ml to prevent fading\nof the \ufb02uorescence. The hybridized bacteria were visualized by epi\ufb02uorescence\nmicroscopy at 3400 or 31,000 magni\ufb01cation on a Leica DMRB microscope\nequipped with a 100-W mercury lamp and an 13 \ufb01lter (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany)\nfor excitation at 450 to 490 nm. Nonhybridized bacteria were hardly detectable\nand were identi\ufb01ed by phase-contrast microscopy. 1mages were captured with a\nSony (Tokyo, Japan) DXC-930P 3CCD video camera and a Oculus TCX frame\ngrabber (Coreco 1nc.). Pictures were processed as tagged-image \ufb01le format\n(TIFF) \ufb01les on a personal computer running 1mage-Pro software, version 1.3\n(Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, Md.).\nMurine experimental infections and clinical material. Monoinfected murine\nlung and liver tissue samples were prepared by inoculation of bacteria in the\nlateral tail vein as described by Tegtmeier et al. (33). S. typhimurium DVL 3389-1\nand E. coli ATCC 25299 were used for the inoculations. Bacteria from 10 ml of\nnutrient broth were harvested and washed in normal saline (0.9% NaCl). The\nsuspensions were adjusted to 109 CFU/ml by resuspending them in normal saline,\nand the mice received a dose of 0.5 ml. Six-week-old female Balb/c mice were\ninoculated with either E. coli or S. typhimurium; controls received only normal\nsaline. After 10 min, the mice were sacri\ufb01ced by cervical dislocation and their\nlungs and livers were aseptically removed and placed in a sterile petri dish. To\nverify the monoinfection with the inoculated strain, the organism was reisolated\nfrom each organ by plating on BA and Drigalski agar. A sample from each organ\nwas \ufb01xed in 10% buffered formalin for 3 days, embedded in paraf\ufb01n, cut in 3-mm\nslides, and mounted on coated microscope slides (Superfrost1; Menzel-Gla\n\u00a8ser,\nBraunschweig, Germany).\nSamples from pigs and calves with pneumonia or enterocolitis were received at\nthe pathological laboratory at DVL for diagnostic purposes. The samples were\ndelivered un\ufb01xed by ordinary mail and were \ufb01xed in buffered formalin upon\nreceipt. 1n situ hybridization of tissue specimens. Tissue sections from the experimen-\ntally infected mice or histological sections of clinical material were tested for\nSalmonella by hybridization with Sal3 and Eub338. To test for nonspeci\ufb01c bind-\ning the nonsense probe Non338 was used. The slides were dewaxed twice in xylol\nfor 5 min each time and in 99% ethanol for 5 min. With a DAKO-pen (DAKO,\nGlostrup, Denmark) a circle was drawn around the tissue specimen, and 20 ml of\nhybridization buffer (0.7 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.1% sodium dodecyl\nsulfate, 10 mM EDTA) containing 5 ng of oligonucleotide probe per ml was\nadded. For labelling of all bacteria in the clinical specimen a mixture of \ufb02uores-\ncein-labelled Sal3 and Cy3-labelled Eub338 was added to the same hybridization\nbuffer. The slides were placed in a humid chamber and incubated for 16 h at\n45\u00b0C. Washing, mounting, and detection were performed as described above for\nwhole-cell hybridization. Fluorescent bacteria were detected in the tissue by\nepi\ufb02uorescense microscopy with the G/R \ufb01lter combination (Leica) for the\nsimultaneous excitation of \ufb02uorescein and Cy3 at 490 and 575 nm.\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The sequence data have been depos-\nited in GenBank under accession nos. U88706 (S. typhimurium NVL3389-1),\nU88707 (C. amalonaticus UX31), and U88708 (Proteus mirabilis SN157).\nRESULTS\nrRNA gene sequencing. The middle parts of the 23S rRNA\ngenes (E. coli positions 1243 to 1841) of S. typhimurium, C.\namalonaticus, and P. mirabilis were sequenced and aligned with\nhomologous sequences from other serotypes and species of the\nfamily Enterobacteriaceae. Two regions with high sequence\nvariability were identi\ufb01ed at positions 1470 to 1590 and posi-\ntions 1710 to 1750, respectively. The homologous sequence\nfrom each strain showed a high degree of similarity to the\nsequence of the E. coli 23S rrnB gene (7), con\ufb01rming the close\nrelationship among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.\nWhen calculating absolute similarity, including the similarities\nof hypervariable regions, the S. typhimurium sequence was the\nmost closely related to the C. amalonaticus sequence, with a\nsimilarity of 98%, and to the E. coli sequence, with a similarity\nof 97%, while it was more divergent from the P. mirabilis\nsequence, with a similarity of 90%. When the S. typhimurium\nsequence was aligned with homologous sequences from the\nother Salmonella subspecies, the absolute similarity, including\nthe similarities of hypervariable regions, were 97 to 99.5%,\nwith the highest similarity being to the sequence of subspecies 1. 1t was not possible to generate a single probe with a se-\nquence that matched those of serovars of S. enterica for this\npart of the 23S gene. 1nstead, a probe matching the sequences\nof Salmonella subspecies 1, 1IIb, and VI but with a single\nmismatch for Salmonella subspecies 1I and 1V and two mis-\nmatches for Salmonella subspecies 1IIa was selected. A list of\nthe base compositions within the target area is presented in\nTable 1. The target sequences were similar within each sub-\nspecies with the exception of the sequences of S. tennessee and\nSalmonella subspecies 1I (S. basel), which each diverged by one\nbase. The sequences of nonsalmonellae all diverged by at least\ntwo mismatches.\nWhole-cell hybridization. The sensitivity and speci\ufb01city of\nthe probe were tested by hybridization with \ufb02uorescence-la-\nbelled probes on smears of formalin-\ufb01xed whole cells (Fig.\n1A). All strains except Staphylococcus aureus were able to\nhybridize with Eub338. Sal3 was tested against 86 Salmonella\nisolates covering 55 serovars from subspecies 1 to VI. By using\nlow-stringency hybridization and washing conditions, the probe\nhybridized and yielded a strong signal for 80 of 86 Salmonella\nisolates tested (Table 2). As predicted from the alignment of\nthe sequence in the target area (Table 1), the probe hybridized\nto the sequences of the tested serovars of subspecies 1, 1I, 1IIb, 1V, and VI, although the sequences of serovars of subspecies 1I\nand 1V had one mismatch. No hybridization was obtained with\nthe four strains of subspecies 1IIa, one strain of subspecies V,\nand one strain of subspecies 1I (S. basel), which all had two to\nVOL. 35, 1997 1N SITU HYBRIDIZATION OF SALMONELLA SEROVARS\n2643\n\nthree mismatches (Table 1). No cross hybridization was ob-\nserved to any of 64 other representatives of the family Entero-\nbacteriaceae tested or to 18 bacterial strains outside of the\nfamily Enterobacteriaceae which might occur in the intestinal\ntract of pigs and humans (Table 3). 1n situ hybridization of tissue specimens. To test the abili-\nties of the probes to hybridize in situ in paraf\ufb01n-embedded\nmaterial, murine tissue experimentally infected with either S.\ntyphimurium or E. coli was prepared. Only tissue from monoin-\nfected organs veri\ufb01ed by bacterial culturing was used in the\ntest. 1n tissue sections from S. typhimurium-infected mice, a\ndistinct \ufb02uorescent signal from rod-shaped bacteria could be\ndetected when hybridization with Sal3 was performed. Bacteria\ncould be identi\ufb01ed as single cells in the liver sinusoids or in the\nvessels of the lung, as expected from the hematogenous spread\nof the bacteria (Fig. 1B). The same result was achieved when\nhybridization with Eub338 was performed. 1n the tissue from\nE. coli-infected mice, only Eub338 hybridized to bacteria in the\ntissue, and no signal was obtained when hybridization with Sal3\nwas performed. To test for nonspeci\ufb01c binding of the probe,\ntissue sections were incubated with a nonsense probe, probe\nNon338, which contains the a base sequence complementary to\nthat of Eub338 and which is unable to hybridize to ribosomes.\nWhen using this probe no signal was detected at all, con\ufb01rming\nthe speci\ufb01cities of the probes.\nThe probes were also tested with formalin-\ufb01xed histological\nsections from 15 pigs and calves with histories of pneumonia or\nenterocolitis in which S. typhimurium or S. dublin was found by\ntraditional culture methods (data not shown). For histological\nsections from all animals the salmonella probe hybridized spe-\nci\ufb01cally, and Salmonella bacteria could be seen either as clus-\nters of cells in the necrotic debris or as single cells scattered\nthroughout the in\ufb02amed tissue. 1n a few instances single bac-\nteria were detected intracellularly as well. 1n order to show the\nspatial localization of salmonella in relation to the indigenous\nmicro\ufb02ora, the \ufb02uorescein-labelled Sal3 probe was used to-\ngether with a Cy3-labelled universal probe in the same slide\n(Fig. 1C). Salmonella bacteria were detected deep in the lam-\nina propria and in the super\ufb01cial debris, while the indigenous\nmicro\ufb02ora were shown to be localized only super\ufb01cially in the\ndebris. The number of Salmonella bacteria detected in each\nsection varied. 1n some sections only a few microcolonies were\nfound, while in others numerous bacterial clusters were de-\ntected.\nFor \ufb01ve samples in which Salmonella had not been detected\nby culturing, only Eub338 hybridized to the bacteria. No un-\nspeci\ufb01c binding of the probe was observed when hybridization\nwith the nonsense probe in the clinical material was per-\nformed.\nDISCUSSION 1n the present study a speci\ufb01c oligonucleotide probe was\ndeveloped for the in situ detection of S. enterica serovars in\nbacterial smears and in tissue sections by the FISH technique.\nSelection of the probe sequence was based upon alignment of\na sequence segment in the 23S rRNA gene from several sal-\nmonella serotypes and other enterobacterial strains. This seg-\nment was selected because it contains two regions which have\npreviously been shown to exhibit high degrees of sequence\nvariability in bacteria (9, 34). The stringency of the hybridiza-\ntion conditions was chosen so that it would not discriminate\nbetween strains with one mismatch, because this allows for the\nspeci\ufb01c detection of the largest group of S. enterica but does\nTABLE 1.

CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\nnot allow for cross hybridization to any of the closely related\nCitrobacter species or E. coli. Most important, all tested sero-\nvars from subspecies 1 hybridized with Sal3, because members\nof this subspecies constitute the most commonly encountered\nand the most pathogenic serovars (5, 18).\nThe separation of serovars into seven homology groups or\nsubspecies is based on DNA-DNA hybridization studies (12,\n19). The same separation of serovars has been found when\ncomparing 23S rRNA gene sequences (10); the variations were\nlow within genes from serovars of the same subspecies, but\nthey were three times higher when serovars from different\nsubspecies were compared. On the basis of the assumption that\nthe genetic sequence is highly conserved within each subspe-\ncies, the speci\ufb01city of the probe was tested against 55 serovars\nrepresenting all seven subspecies. This test showed a high\ndegree of conservation in the probe target area, because the\nprobe hybridized only to the subspecies expected from the\nalignment shown in Table 1. However, one strain from sub-\nspecies 1I failed to hybridize because this strain contained two\nmismatches instead of one, as for the other subspecies 1I\nstrains.\nSeveral DNA probes used for the detection of Salmonella in\nfood or feces have been published (1, 15, 23). Most probes\ntarget chromosomal or plasmid genes, but oligonucleotide\nprobes targeting the 16S and 23S rRNA have also been pub-\nlished (21, 30, 36). Those probes have been applied in detec-\ntion assays based on denaturated DNA or RNA bound to\nmembranes, eliminating the possibility of the detection and\nspatial localization of single bacterial cells in tissue samples.\nHybridization to ribosomes in situ is highly dependent on\ntarget accessibility (4). Secondary and tertiary structures in the\ncells, as well as protein binding, might prevent hybridization to\nthe ribosome (4), thus making speci\ufb01c probes meant for other\napplications useless for the detection of bacteria by the FISH\ntechnique. The target sequence of Sal3 is located at helix 63,\nand in this study we have shown it to be accessible for in situ\nhybridization of Salmonella.\nFixation is another crucial step for in situ hybridization (4,\n22). The \ufb01xative serves the dual purposes of opening up the\nbacterial wall for probe penetration and protecting the ribo-\nsomes from degradation by endogenous RNase activity. Alde-\nhyde \ufb01xatives are most frequently used with gram-negative\nbacteria (14), whereas alcohol \ufb01xation is recommended for\ngram-positive bacteria (6, 29). 1n our hands, formalin \ufb01xation\nenabled hybridization of both gram-negative and gram-positive\nbacteria. The exception was S. aureus, for which hybridization\nwith Eub338 was not achieved, probably due to the low level of\npermeability of the cell wall.\nThe use of short oligonucleotide probes reduces the time\nand temperature required for hybridization. By increasing the\nprobe concentration the velocity of the hybridization is further\nincreased; however, this also increases nonspeci\ufb01c staining\n(35). When using an intermediate probe concentration of 1 to\n5 ng/ml, the ribosomes in E. coli were saturated after 2 h of\nincubation with Eub338 (35). When hybridizing to pure cul-\ntures, 3 h of incubation was used, with excellent results. How-\never, for reasons of convenience, the tissue samples were hy-\nbridized overnight.\nTo enhance the level of discrimination of the signal from\nsingle bacteria in tissue sections, we applied a narrow-band-\nFIG. 1.

(B) Formalin-\ufb01xed tissue section of murine\nlung tissue experimentally infected with S. typhimurium and hybridized with Sal3,\nshowing rod-shaped green \ufb02uorescent bacteria in the small capillaries of the lung\ntissue and red auto\ufb02uorescing erythrocytes. (C) Tissue section from colon of a\npig with salmonellosis. By hybridizing with a mixture of Sal3 labelled with \ufb02uo-\nrescein and the universal bacterial probe (Eub338) labelled with Cy3, the spatial\nlocalization of salmonella (yellow) can be determined in proportion to the\nindigenous micro\ufb02ora (red). The color of salmonella is changed as it hybridizes\nwith both probes.

MICROBIOL.\n\nThe theoretical sensitivity of detection by the FISH tech-\nnique is one bacterium in a 3-mm-thick tissue section; however,\nthe number of bacteria in each tissue section from the clinical\nmaterial varied signi\ufb01cantly. By performing hybridization with\ntissue sections, we were able to detect salmonella bacteria in all\nthe samples which were found to be positive by traditional\nculture methods. However, when dealing with very low num-\nbers of bacteria, the culture method might still be the most\nsensitive method because it contains a preenrichment step.\nDirect detection of bacteria is highly dependent on the\namount and stability of the target, because the intensity of the\nsignal is proportional to the rRNA content (14). Used as a\nresearch tool, the FISH technique has previously been applied\nfor studying the spatial distribution of E. coli or S. typhimurium\nin the intestines of monoinfected mice (20, 27). This was done\nunder optimal research conditions. We found that this tech-\nnique is also applicable for the detection of Salmonella in\nclinical samples. The detection of Salmonella bacteria in tissue\nwas possible even after the paraf\ufb01n-embedding process and in\nthe presence of indigenous micro\ufb02ora. Autolysis of the tissue,\nas a result of the material being shipped un\ufb01xed to the labo-\nratory, did not hinder the detection of the bacteria in our study. 1n this study we have developed and tested a \ufb02uorescence-\nlabelled oligonucleotide probe for the speci\ufb01c detection of S.\nenterica in clinical samples by in situ hybridization. The stability\nof the ribosome target allowed for the detection of single cells\neven in clinical material, as well as identi\ufb01cation in smears of\npure cultures. The results obtained by use of a readily synthe-\nsized \ufb02uorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probe, combined\nwith a simple hybridization protocol, therefore suggest that the\nFISH technique can be used for the detection of S. enterica\nserovars.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Peter Ahrens for technical support with the sequencing\nand Henning Rasmussen for serotyping, while we thank Anni Ravn\nand Ulla Andreasen for technical assistance in preparing the tissue\nsections.

On the basis of the 23S rRNA gene sequences representing all of the S. enterica\nsubspecies and S. bongori, an 18-mer oligonucleotide probe was selected. The speci\ufb01city of the probe was tested\nby in situ hybridization to bacterial cell smears of pure cultures. Forty-nine of 55 tested Salmonella serovars\nbelonging to subspecies I, II, IIIb, IV, and VI hybridized with the probe. The probe did not hybridize to serovars\nfrom subspecies IIIa (S. arizonae) or to S. bongori. No cross-reaction to 64 other strains of the family\nEnterobacteriaceae or 18 other bacterial strains outside this family was observed. The probe was tested with\nsections of formalin-\ufb01xed, paraf\ufb01n-embedded tissue from experimentally infected mice or from animals with\na history of clinical salmonellosis. In these tissue sections the probe hybridized speci\ufb01cally to Salmonella\nserovars, allowing for the detection of single bacterial cells. The development of a \ufb02uorescence-labelled speci\ufb01c\noligonucleotide probe makes the FISH technique a promising tool for the rapid identi\ufb01cation of S. enterica in\nbacterial smears, as well as for the detection of S. enterica in histological tissue sections.\nDifferent serovars of Salmonella have long been recognized\nas major causes of infections in humans and animals, causing a\nvariety of clinical manifestations ranging from mild gastroen-\nteritis to severe sepsis (13). Clinical infection is often followed\nby a subclinical carrier state, in which the convalescing indi-\nvidual may continue to shed salmonellae in feces for a longer\nperiod (11).\nThe genus Salmonella can be divided into seven homology\ngroups by DNA-DNA hybridization studies (12, 19); however,\nthe genus is a large group with respect to antigenicity, consist-\ning of more than 2,300 described serovars (25). As DNA ho-\nmology group V diverges from the others, it has been proposed\nas a new species, Salmonella bongori (28). The remaining sub-\nspecies, subspecies I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, and VI, belong to the\nspecies Salmonella enterica. Subspecies I is the largest group,\nwith about 59% of the described Salmonella serovars (25),\nincluding all the clinically most relevant serovars (18).\nThe interactions of single bacterial strains in complex eco-\nlogical systems have been studied by \ufb02uorescence in situ hy-\nbridization (FISH) techniques. By hybridizing with \ufb02uores-\ncence-labelled oligonucleotide probes speci\ufb01cally targeting\nribosomes in Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium, the\nspatial distribution of bacteria in the intestinal \ufb02ora of strep-\ntomycin-treated mice has been established (20, 27). However,\nto be able to detect a broad range of clinically relevant Salmo-\nnella serovars by the FISH technique under natural conditions,\na genus-speci\ufb01c RNA-targeted probe is necessary. Such a\nprobe has so far not been available.\nThe ribosomal genes are universally distributed and contain\nhighly conserved regions as well as variable regions, toward\nwhich oligonucleotide probes with various speci\ufb01cities can be\ndeveloped (26, 32). In growing bacteria the gene is transcribed\ninto a high number of ribosomes, and following \ufb01xation these\ncan be used as targets for hybridization with short oligonucle-\notide probes (16). By end labelling such probes with \ufb02uores-\ncent molecules, single bacterial cells can be identi\ufb01ed by epi-\n\ufb02uorescence microscopy (14).\nThe purpose of this study was to generate a speci\ufb01c oligo-\nnucleotide probe targeting the different serovars of S. enterica\nby sequencing and aligning 23S rRNA gene sequences and to\nevaluate the applicability of the probe for FISH identi\ufb01cation of\nSalmonella in bacterial smears and detection in formalin-\ufb01xed,\nparaf\ufb01n-embedded specimens from animals with clinical Salmo-\nnella infections.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and culture methods. The strains used to test the speci\ufb01city\nof the oligonucleotide probe are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Salmonella strains were\neither type strains or clinical isolates identi\ufb01ed by serotyping at the Danish\nVeterinary Laboratory (DVL). Other representatives of the family Enterobacte-\nriaceae were type strains or clinical isolates identi\ufb01ed by using the API 20E\nsystem (bioMe\n\u00b4rieux, Marcy, France). Gram-positive test strains were all type\nstrains. The bacteria used to test probe speci\ufb01city and for sequencing were all\ncultured overnight at 37\u00b0C on blood agar (BA; CM331 [Oxoid] supplemented\nwith 5% bovine blood). The strains used to inoculate the experimentally infected\nmice were grown in nutrient broth (CM1 [Difco]) at 37\u00b0C overnight. Samples\nfrom lung and liver were plated on BA and Drigalski agar (17), and the plates\nwere incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C.\nFixation of bacteria for smear hybridization. A single colony from an over-\nnight culture was picked and resuspended in 800 ml of 10% buffered formalin,\nand the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The bacteria were\npelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 3 g for 5 min, washed in 500 ml of 0.1%\nNonidet P-40 (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.), and resuspended in a 1:1 mix-\nture of a storage buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and 96%\nethanol. The \ufb01xed bacteria were stored at 220\u00b0C until use.\nSequencing of rRNA genes of the bacteria. S. typhimurium DVL 3389-1,\nProteus mirabilis SN157, and Citrobacter amalonaticus UX31 were used for par-\ntial sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene.

The bacteria were resuspended in 100 ml of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0],\n1 mM EDTA), lysed by boiling for 10 min, and immediately cooled on ice. The\nlysates were diluted 1:100 in double-distilled H2O (ddH2O), and 2 ml of this\nsolution was added to 50 ml of a PCR mixture consisting of 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM\nMgCl2, 10 pmol of each primer, 100 mM (each) dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP,\nand 0.5 U of polymerase (Amplitaq; Perkin-Elmer) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3).\nPrimers with homology to E. coli were used for PCR ampli\ufb01cation of a segment\nin the 23S rRNA gene; the forward primer, 59-TCAGAAGTGCGAATGC-39,\nwas located at position 1243 (E. coli numbering), and the reverse primer,\n59-AACTTACCCGACAAGG-39, was located at position 1941 (9). Ampli\ufb01ca-\ntion was carried out on a thermocycler, with initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min\nand subsequent ampli\ufb01cation for 34 cycles, with each cycle consisting of ameal-\ning at 45\u00b0C for 1 min, extension at 72\u00b0C for 2 min, and denaturation at 94\u00b0C for\n2 min. The 698-base PCR product was puri\ufb01ed by using QIAquick spin columns\n(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and\nwas veri\ufb01ed by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.\nThe nucleotide sequence of the PCR product was determined by cycle se-\nquencing (31) with an Amplitaq FS dye terminator kit and a 373A automatic\nDNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, Calif.) by using\nthe same primers used for the PCR ampli\ufb01cation. The segments were sequenced\ntwice in both directions.\nSelection of probe sequence. The sequences obtained were aligned with the\npublished E. coli 23S rrnB sequence (7), together with sequences from Salmo-\nnella serovars representing all subspecies (8, 10, 37), Yersinia enterocolitica (10),\nand Citrobacter freundii (10), by using the Sequence Navigator software (Applied\nBiosystems). An 18-mer oligonucleotide probe sequence complementary to the\nregion from positions 1713 to 1730 (E. coli numbering) was selected as being\nspeci\ufb01c for Salmonella subspecies I, IIIb, and VI. The theoretical speci\ufb01city was\nchecked by using the CHECK_PROBE program in the RDP Database (24) and\nin the EMBL database by using the Fasta search tool.\nOligonucleotide probes. A Salmonella oligonucleotide probe (Sal3; 59-AATC\nACTTCACCTACGTG-39) the universal bacterial probe (Eub338; 59-GCTGCC\nTCCCGTAGGAGT-39) (3), and a nonsense probe with a sequence complemen-\ntary to Eub338 (Non338; 59-CGACGGAGGGCATCCTCA-39) (35) were used.\nThe probes were all synthesized and labelled with \ufb02uorescein (Sal3 and Non338)\nor the red \ufb02uorescent dye Cy3 (Eub338) at the 59 end (Hobolth DNA syntese,\nHiller\u00f8d, Denmark). The systematic name of the salmonella probe was L-S-Sal-\n1713-a-A-18 (2); however, for reasons of simplicity it is designated Sal3 in this\nreport.\nWhole-cell hybridization. The speci\ufb01city of Sal3 was tested by hybridization\nwith whole bacterial cells. The universal bacterial probe Eub338 served as a\npositive control. Six-well Te\ufb02on-coated slides (NovaKemi, Enskede, Sweden)\nwere coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma Chemical) according to the manufactur-\ner\u2019s instructions. A 1-ml solution of \ufb01xed bacteria was spotted in the wells and air\ndried. Bacteria were dehydrated in 70 and 96% ethanol for 2 min at each\nconcentration. After drying, 8 ml of hybridization solution (0.7 M NaCl, 0.1 M\nTris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 mM EDTA) containing 5 ng\nof probe per ml was added, and the slide was placed in a moisture chamber and\nincubated for 3 h at 45\u00b0C. Washing was performed by immersing the slide gently\nin ddH2O, and this was followed by incubation in preheated hybridization buffer\nat 45\u00b0C for 20 min. Finally, the slide was rinsed in ddH2O and air dried. The\nslides were mounted in a phosphate-buffered (pH 8.5) medium; the medium\ncontained 20 mg of n-propyl gallate (Sigma Chemical) per ml to prevent fading\nof the \ufb02uorescence. The hybridized bacteria were visualized by epi\ufb02uorescence\nmicroscopy at 3400 or 31,000 magni\ufb01cation on a Leica DMRB microscope\nequipped with a 100-W mercury lamp and an I3 \ufb01lter (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany)\nfor excitation at 450 to 490 nm. Nonhybridized bacteria were hardly detectable\nand were identi\ufb01ed by phase-contrast microscopy. Images were captured with a\nSony (Tokyo, Japan) DXC-930P 3CCD video camera and a Oculus TCX frame\ngrabber (Coreco Inc.). Pictures were processed as tagged-image \ufb01le format\n(TIFF) \ufb01les on a personal computer ruming Image-Pro software, version 1.3\n(Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, Md.).\nMurine experimental infections and clinical material. Monoinfected murine\nlung and liver tissue samples were prepared by inoculation of bacteria in the\nlateral tail vein as described by Tegtmeier et al. (33). S. typhimurium DVL 3389-1\nand E. coli ATCC 25299 were used for the inoculations. Bacteria from 10 ml of\nnutrient broth were harvested and washed in normal saline (0.9% NaCl). The\nsuspensions were adjusted to 109 CFU/ml by resuspending them in normal saline,\nand the mice received a dose of 0.5 ml. Six-week-old female Balb/c mice were\ninoculated with either E. coli or S. typhimurium; controls received only normal\nsaline. After 10 min, the mice were sacri\ufb01ced by cervical dislocation and their\nlungs and livers were aseptically removed and placed in a sterile petri dish. To\nverify the monoinfection with the inoculated strain, the organism was reisolated\nfrom each organ by plating on BA and Drigalski agar. A sample from each organ\nwas \ufb01xed in 10% buffered formalin for 3 days, embedded in paraf\ufb01n, cut in 3-mm\nslides, and mounted on coated microscope slides (Superfrost1; Menzel-Gla\n\u00a8ser,\nBraunschweig, Germany).\nSamples from pigs and calves with pneumonia or enterocolitis were received at\nthe pathological laboratory at DVL for diagnostic purposes. The samples were\ndelivered un\ufb01xed by ordinary mail and were \ufb01xed in buffered formalin upon\nreceipt.\nIn situ hybridization of tissue specimens. Tissue sections from the experimen-\ntally infected mice or histological sections of clinical material were tested for\nSalmonella by hybridization with Sal3 and Eub338. To test for nonspeci\ufb01c bind-\ning the nonsense probe Non338 was used. The slides were dewaxed twice in xylol\nfor 5 min each time and in 99% ethanol for 5 min. With a DAKO-pen (DAKO,\nGlostrup, Denmark) a circle was drawn around the tissue specimen, and 20 ml of\nhybridization buffer (0.7 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.1% sodium dodecyl\nsulfate, 10 mM EDTA) containing 5 ng of oligonucleotide probe per ml was\nadded. For labelling of all bacteria in the clinical specimen a mixture of \ufb02uores-\ncein-labelled Sal3 and Cy3-labelled Eub338 was added to the same hybridization\nbuffer. The slides were placed in a humid chamber and incubated for 16 h at\n45\u00b0C. Washing, mounting, and detection were performed as described above for\nwhole-cell hybridization. Fluorescent bacteria were detected in the tissue by\nepi\ufb02uorescense microscopy with the G/R \ufb01lter combination (Leica) for the\nsimultaneous excitation of \ufb02uorescein and Cy3 at 490 and 575 nm.\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The sequence data have been depos-\nited in GenBank under accession nos. U88706 (S. typhimurium NVL3389-1),\nU88707 (C. amalonaticus UX31), and U88708 (Proteus mirabilis SN157).\nRESULTS\nrRNA gene sequencing. The middle parts of the 23S rRNA\ngenes (E. coli positions 1243 to 1841) of S. typhimurium, C.\namalonaticus, and P. mirabilis were sequenced and aligned with\nhomologous sequences from other serotypes and species of the\nfamily Enterobacteriaceae. Two regions with high sequence\nvariability were identi\ufb01ed at positions 1470 to 1590 and posi-\ntions 1710 to 1750, respectively. The homologous sequence\nfrom each strain showed a high degree of similarity to the\nsequence of the E. coli 23S rrnB gene (7), con\ufb01rming the close\nrelationship among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.\nWhen calculating absolute similarity, including the similarities\nof hypervariable regions, the S. typhimurium sequence was the\nmost closely related to the C. amalonaticus sequence, with a\nsimilarity of 98%, and to the E. coli sequence, with a similarity\nof 97%, while it was more divergent from the P. mirabilis\nsequence, with a similarity of 90%. When the S. typhimurium\nsequence was aligned with homologous sequences from the\nother Salmonella subspecies, the absolute similarity, including\nthe similarities of hypervariable regions, were 97 to 99.5%,\nwith the highest similarity being to the sequence of subspecies\nI.\nIt was not possible to generate a single probe with a se-\nquence that matched those of serovars of S. enterica for this\npart of the 23S gene. Instead, a probe matching the sequences\nof Salmonella subspecies I, IIIb, and VI but with a single\nmismatch for Salmonella subspecies II and IV and two mis-\nmatches for Salmonella subspecies IIIa was selected. A list of\nthe base compositions within the target area is presented in\nTable 1. The target sequences were similar within each sub-\nspecies with the exception of the sequences of S. temessee and\nSalmonella subspecies II (S. basel), which each diverged by one\nbase. The sequences of nonsalmonellae all diverged by at least\ntwo mismatches.\nWhole-cell hybridization. The sensitivity and speci\ufb01city of\nthe probe were tested by hybridization with \ufb02uorescence-la-\nbelled probes on smears of formalin-\ufb01xed whole cells (Fig.\n1A). All strains except Staphylococcus aureus were able to\nhybridize with Eub338. Sal3 was tested against 86 Salmonella\nisolates covering 55 serovars from subspecies I to VI. By using\nlow-stringency hybridization and washing conditions, the probe\nhybridized and yielded a strong signal for 80 of 86 Salmonella\nisolates tested (Table 2). As predicted from the alignment of\nthe sequence in the target area (Table 1), the probe hybridized\nto the sequences of the tested serovars of subspecies I, II, IIIb,\nIV, and VI, although the sequences of serovars of subspecies II\nand IV had one mismatch. No hybridization was obtained with\nthe four strains of subspecies IIIa, one strain of subspecies V,\nand one strain of subspecies II (S. basel), which all had two to\nVOL. 35, 1997\nIN SITU HYBRIDIZATION OF SALMONELLA SEROVARS\n2643\n\nthree mismatches (Table 1). No cross hybridization was ob-\nserved to any of 64 other representatives of the family Entero-\nbacteriaceae tested or to 18 bacterial strains outside of the\nfamily Enterobacteriaceae which might occur in the intestinal\ntract of pigs and humans (Table 3).\nIn situ hybridization of tissue specimens. To test the abili-\nties of the probes to hybridize in situ in paraf\ufb01n-embedded\nmaterial, murine tissue experimentally infected with either S.\ntyphimurium or E. coli was prepared. Only tissue from monoin-\nfected organs veri\ufb01ed by bacterial culturing was used in the\ntest. In tissue sections from S. typhimurium-infected mice, a\ndistinct \ufb02uorescent signal from rod-shaped bacteria could be\ndetected when hybridization with Sal3 was performed. Bacteria\ncould be identi\ufb01ed as single cells in the liver sinusoids or in the\nvessels of the lung, as expected from the hematogenous spread\nof the bacteria (Fig. 1B). The same result was achieved when\nhybridization with Eub338 was performed. In the tissue from\nE. coli-infected mice, only Eub338 hybridized to bacteria in the\ntissue, and no signal was obtained when hybridization with Sal3\nwas performed. To test for nonspeci\ufb01c binding of the probe,\ntissue sections were incubated with a nonsense probe, probe\nNon338, which contains the a base sequence complementary to\nthat of Eub338 and which is unable to hybridize to ribosomes.\nWhen using this probe no signal was detected at all, con\ufb01rming\nthe speci\ufb01cities of the probes.\nThe probes were also tested with formalin-\ufb01xed histological\nsections from 15 pigs and calves with histories of pneumonia or\nenterocolitis in which S. typhimurium or S. dublin was found by\ntraditional culture methods (data not shown). For histological\nsections from all animals the salmonella probe hybridized spe-\nci\ufb01cally, and Salmonella bacteria could be seen either as clus-\nters of cells in the necrotic debris or as single cells scattered\nthroughout the in\ufb02amed tissue. In a few instances single bac-\nteria were detected intracellularly as well. In order to show the\nspatial localization of salmonella in relation to the indigenous\nmicro\ufb02ora, the \ufb02uorescein-labelled Sal3 probe was used to-\ngether with a Cy3-labelled universal probe in the same slide\n(Fig. 1C). Salmonella bacteria were detected deep in the lam-\nina propria and in the super\ufb01cial debris, while the indigenous\nmicro\ufb02ora were shown to be localized only super\ufb01cially in the\ndebris. The number of Salmonella bacteria detected in each\nsection varied. In some sections only a few microcolonies were\nfound, while in others numerous bacterial clusters were de-\ntected.\nFor \ufb01ve samples in which Salmonella had not been detected\nby culturing, only Eub338 hybridized to the bacteria. No un-\nspeci\ufb01c binding of the probe was observed when hybridization\nwith the nonsense probe in the clinical material was per-\nformed.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study a speci\ufb01c oligonucleotide probe was\ndeveloped for the in situ detection of S. enterica serovars in\nbacterial smears and in tissue sections by the FISH technique.\nSelection of the probe sequence was based upon alignment of\na sequence segment in the 23S rRNA gene from several sal-\nmonella serotypes and other enterobacterial strains. This seg-\nment was selected because it contains two regions which have\npreviously been shown to exhibit high degrees of sequence\nvariability in bacteria (9, 34). The stringency of the hybridiza-\ntion conditions was chosen so that it would not discriminate\nbetween strains with one mismatch, because this allows for the\nspeci\ufb01c detection of the largest group of S. enterica but does\nTABLE 1.

CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\nnot allow for cross hybridization to any of the closely related\nCitrobacter species or E. coli. Most important, all tested sero-\nvars from subspecies I hybridized with Sal3, because members\nof this subspecies constitute the most commonly encountered\nand the most pathogenic serovars (5, 18).\nThe separation of serovars into seven homology groups or\nsubspecies is based on DNA-DNA hybridization studies (12,\n19). The same separation of serovars has been found when\ncomparing 23S rRNA gene sequences (10); the variations were\nlow within genes from serovars of the same subspecies, but\nthey were three times higher when serovars from different\nsubspecies were compared. On the basis of the assumption that\nthe genetic sequence is highly conserved within each subspe-\ncies, the speci\ufb01city of the probe was tested against 55 serovars\nrepresenting all seven subspecies. This test showed a high\ndegree of conservation in the probe target area, because the\nprobe hybridized only to the subspecies expected from the\nalignment shown in Table 1. However, one strain from sub-\nspecies II failed to hybridize because this strain contained two\nmismatches instead of one, as for the other subspecies II\nstrains.\nSeveral DNA probes used for the detection of Salmonella in\nfood or feces have been published (1, 15, 23). Most probes\ntarget chromosomal or plasmid genes, but oligonucleotide\nprobes targeting the 16S and 23S rRNA have also been pub-\nlished (21, 30, 36). Those probes have been applied in detec-\ntion assays based on denaturated DNA or RNA bound to\nmembranes, eliminating the possibility of the detection and\nspatial localization of single bacterial cells in tissue samples.\nHybridization to ribosomes in situ is highly dependent on\ntarget accessibility (4). Secondary and tertiary structures in the\ncells, as well as protein binding, might prevent hybridization to\nthe ribosome (4), thus making speci\ufb01c probes meant for other\napplications useless for the detection of bacteria by the FISH\ntechnique. The target sequence of Sal3 is located at helix 63,\nand in this study we have shown it to be accessible for in situ\nhybridization of Salmonella.\nFixation is another crucial step for in situ hybridization (4,\n22). The \ufb01xative serves the dual purposes of opening up the\nbacterial wall for probe penetration and protecting the ribo-\nsomes from degradation by endogenous RNase activity. Alde-\nhyde \ufb01xatives are most frequently used with gram-negative\nbacteria (14), whereas alcohol \ufb01xation is recommended for\ngram-positive bacteria (6, 29). In our hands, formalin \ufb01xation\nenabled hybridization of both gram-negative and gram-positive\nbacteria. The exception was S. aureus, for which hybridization\nwith Eub338 was not achieved, probably due to the low level of\npermeability of the cell wall.\nThe use of short oligonucleotide probes reduces the time\nand temperature required for hybridization. By increasing the\nprobe concentration the velocity of the hybridization is further\nincreased; however, this also increases nonspeci\ufb01c staining\n(35). When using an intermediate probe concentration of 1 to\n5 ng/ml, the ribosomes in E. coli were saturated after 2 h of\nincubation with Eub338 (35). When hybridizing to pure cul-\ntures, 3 h of incubation was used, with excellent results. How-\never, for reasons of convenience, the tissue samples were hy-\nbridized overnight.\nTo enhance the level of discrimination of the signal from\nsingle bacteria in tissue sections, we applied a narrow-band-\nFIG. 1.

(C) Tissue section from colon of a\npig with salmonellosis. By hybridizing with a mixture of Sal3 labelled with \ufb02uo-\nrescein and the universal bacterial probe (Eub338) labelled with Cy3, the spatial\nlocalization of salmonella (yellow) can be determined in proportion to the\nindigenous micro\ufb02ora (red).

MICROBIOL.\n\nThe theoretical sensitivity of detection by the FISH tech-\nnique is one bacterium in a 3-mm-thick tissue section; however,\nthe number of bacteria in each tissue section from the clinical\nmaterial varied signi\ufb01cantly. By performing hybridization with\ntissue sections, we were able to detect salmonella bacteria in all\nthe samples which were found to be positive by traditional\nculture methods. However, when dealing with very low num-\nbers of bacteria, the culture method might still be the most\nsensitive method because it contains a preenrichment step.\nDirect detection of bacteria is highly dependent on the\namount and stability of the target, because the intensity of the\nsignal is proportional to the rRNA content (14). Used as a\nresearch tool, the FISH technique has previously been applied\nfor studying the spatial distribution of E. coli or S. typhimurium\nin the intestines of monoinfected mice (20, 27). This was done\nunder optimal research conditions. We found that this tech-\nnique is also applicable for the detection of Salmonella in\nclinical samples. The detection of Salmonella bacteria in tissue\nwas possible even after the paraf\ufb01n-embedding process and in\nthe presence of indigenous micro\ufb02ora. Autolysis of the tissue,\nas a result of the material being shipped un\ufb01xed to the labo-\nratory, did not hinder the detection of the bacteria in our study.\nIn this study we have developed and tested a \ufb02uorescence-\nlabelled oligonucleotide probe for the speci\ufb01c detection of S.\nenterica in clinical samples by in situ hybridization. The stability\nof the ribosome target allowed for the detection of single cells\neven in clinical material, as well as identi\ufb01cation in smears of\npure cultures.

On the basis of the 23S rRNA gene sequences representing all of the S. enterica\nsubspecies and S. bongori, an 18-mer oligonucleotide probe was selected. The speci\ufb01city of the probe was tested\nby in situ hybridization to bacterial cell smears of pure cultures. Forty-nine of 55 tested Salmonella serovars\nbelonging to subspecies I, II, IIIb, IV, and VI hybridized with the probe. The probe did not hybridize to serovars\nfrom subspecies IIIa (S. arizonae) or to S. bongori. No cross-reaction to 64 other strains of the family\nEnterobacteriaceae or 18 other bacterial strains outside this family was observed. The probe was tested with\nsections of formalin-\ufb01xed, paraf\ufb01n-embedded tissue from experimentally infected mice or from animals with\na history of clinical salmonellosis. In these tissue sections the probe hybridized speci\ufb01cally to Salmonella\nserovars, allowing for the detection of single bacterial cells. The development of a \ufb02uorescence-labelled speci\ufb01c\noligonucleotide probe makes the FISH technique a promising tool for the rapid identi\ufb01cation of S. enterica in\nbacterial smears, as well as for the detection of S. enterica in histological tissue sections.\nDifferent serovars of Salmonella have long been recognized\nas major causes of infections in humans and animals, causing a\nvariety of clinical manifestations ranging from mild gastroen-\nteritis to severe sepsis (13). Clinical infection is often followed\nby a subclinical carrier state, in which the convalescing indi-\nvidual may continue to shed salmonellae in feces for a longer\nperiod (11).\nThe genus Salmonella can be divided into seven homology\ngroups by DNA-DNA hybridization studies (12, 19); however,\nthe genus is a large group with respect to antigenicity, consist-\ning of more than 2,300 described serovars (25). As DNA ho-\nmology group V diverges from the others, it has been proposed\nas a new species, Salmonella bongori (28). The remaining sub-\nspecies, subspecies I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, and VI, belong to the\nspecies Salmonella enterica. Subspecies I is the largest group,\nwith about 59% of the described Salmonella serovars (25),\nincluding all the clinically most relevant serovars (18).\nThe interactions of single bacterial strains in complex eco-\nlogical systems have been studied by \ufb02uorescence in situ hy-\nbridization (FISH) techniques. By hybridizing with \ufb02uores-\ncence-labelled oligonucleotide probes speci\ufb01cally targeting\nribosomes in Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium, the\nspatial distribution of bacteria in the intestinal \ufb02ora of strep-\ntomycin-treated mice has been established (20, 27). However,\nto be able to detect a broad range of clinically relevant Salmo-\nnella serovars by the FISH technique under natural conditions,\na genus-speci\ufb01c RNA-targeted probe is necessary. Such a\nprobe has so far not been available.\nThe ribosomal genes are universally distributed and contain\nhighly conserved regions as well as variable regions, toward\nwhich oligonucleotide probes with various speci\ufb01cities can be\ndeveloped (26, 32). In growing bacteria the gene is transcribed\ninto a high number of ribosomes, and following \ufb01xation these\ncan be used as targets for hybridization with short oligonucle-\notide probes (16). By end labelling such probes with \ufb02uores-\ncent molecules, single bacterial cells can be identi\ufb01ed by epi-\n\ufb02uorescence microscopy (14).\nThe purpose of this study was to generate a speci\ufb01c oligo-\nnucleotide probe targeting the different serovars of S. enterica\nby sequencing and aligning 23S rRNA gene sequences and to\nevaluate the applicability of the probe for FISH identi\ufb01cation of\nSalmonella in bacterial smears and detection in formalin-\ufb01xed,\nparaf\ufb01n-embedded specimens from animals with clinical Salmo-\nnella infections.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and culture methods. The strains used to test the speci\ufb01city\nof the oligonucleotide probe are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Salmonella strains were\neither type strains or clinical isolates identi\ufb01ed by serotyping at the Danish\nVeterinary Laboratory (DVL). Other representatives of the family Enterobacte-\nriaceae were type strains or clinical isolates identi\ufb01ed by using the API 20E\nsystem (bioMe\n\u00b4rieux, Marcy, France). Gram-positive test strains were all type\nstrains. The bacteria used to test probe speci\ufb01city and for sequencing were all\ncultured overnight at 37\u00b0C on blood agar (BA; CM331 [Oxoid] supplemented\nwith 5% bovine blood). The strains used to inoculate the experimentally infected\nmice were grown in nutrient broth (CM1 [Difco]) at 37\u00b0C overnight. Samples\nfrom lung and liver were plated on BA and Drigalski agar (17), and the plates\nwere incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C.\nFixation of bacteria for smear hybridization. A single colony from an over-\nnight culture was picked and resuspended in 800 ml of 10% buffered formalin,\nand the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The bacteria were\npelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 3 g for 5 min, washed in 500 ml of 0.1%\nNonidet P-40 (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.), and resuspended in a 1:1 mix-\nture of a storage buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and 96%\nethanol. The \ufb01xed bacteria were stored at 220\u00b0C until use.\nSequencing of rRNA genes of the bacteria. S. typhimurium DVL 3389-1,\nProteus mirabilis SN157, and Citrobacter amalonaticus UX31 were used for par-\ntial sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene. For each isolate a single colony was\npicked and the bacteria were washed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (140\n* Corresponding author.

The bacteria were resuspended in 100 ml of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0],\n1 mM EDTA), lysed by boiling for 10 min, and immediately cooled on ice. The\nlysates were diluted 1:100 in double-distilled H2O (ddH2O), and 2 ml of this\nsolution was added to 50 ml of a PCR mixture consisting of 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM\nMgCl2, 10 pmol of each primer, 100 mM (each) dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP,\nand 0.5 U of polymerase (Amplitaq; Perkin-Elmer) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3).\nPrimers with homology to E. coli were used for PCR ampli\ufb01cation of a segment\nin the 23S rRNA gene; the forward primer, 59-TCAGAAGTGCGAATGC-39,\nwas located at position 1243 (E. coli numbering), and the reverse primer,\n59-AACTTACCCGACAAGG-39, was located at position 1941 (9). Ampli\ufb01ca-\ntion was carried out on a thermocycler, with initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min\nand subsequent ampli\ufb01cation for 34 cycles, with each cycle consisting of anneal-\ning at 45\u00b0C for 1 min, extension at 72\u00b0C for 2 min, and denaturation at 94\u00b0C for\n2 min. The 698-base PCR product was puri\ufb01ed by using QIAquick spin columns\n(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and\nwas veri\ufb01ed by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.\nThe nucleotide sequence of the PCR product was determined by cycle se-\nquencing (31) with an Amplitaq FS dye terminator kit and a 373A automatic\nDNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, Calif.) by using\nthe same primers used for the PCR ampli\ufb01cation. The segments were sequenced\ntwice in both directions.\nSelection of probe sequence. The sequences obtained were aligned with the\npublished E. coli 23S rrnB sequence (7), together with sequences from Salmo-\nnella serovars representing all subspecies (8, 10, 37), Yersinia enterocolitica (10),\nand Citrobacter freundii (10), by using the Sequence Navigator software (Applied\nBiosystems). An 18-mer oligonucleotide probe sequence complementary to the\nregion from positions 1713 to 1730 (E. coli numbering) was selected as being\nspeci\ufb01c for Salmonella subspecies I, IIIb, and VI. The theoretical speci\ufb01city was\nchecked by using the CHECK_PROBE program in the RDP Database (24) and\nin the EMBL database by using the Fasta search tool.\nOligonucleotide probes. A Salmonella oligonucleotide probe (Sal3; 59-AATC\nACTTCACCTACGTG-39) the universal bacterial probe (Eub338; 59-GCTGCC\nTCCCGTAGGAGT-39) (3), and a nonsense probe with a sequence complemen-\ntary to Eub338 (Non338; 59-CGACGGAGGGCATCCTCA-39) (35) were used.\nThe probes were all synthesized and labelled with \ufb02uorescein (Sal3 and Non338)\nor the red \ufb02uorescent dye Cy3 (Eub338) at the 59 end (Hobolth DNA syntese,\nHiller\u00f8d, Denmark). The systematic name of the salmonella probe was L-S-Sal-\n1713-a-A-18 (2); however, for reasons of simplicity it is designated Sal3 in this\nreport.\nWhole-cell hybridization. The speci\ufb01city of Sal3 was tested by hybridization\nwith whole bacterial cells. The universal bacterial probe Eub338 served as a\npositive control. Six-well Te\ufb02on-coated slides (NovaKemi, Enskede, Sweden)\nwere coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma Chemical) according to the manufactur-\ner\u2019s instructions. A 1-ml solution of \ufb01xed bacteria was spotted in the wells and air\ndried. Bacteria were dehydrated in 70 and 96% ethanol for 2 min at each\nconcentration. After drying, 8 ml of hybridization solution (0.7 M NaCl, 0.1 M\nTris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 mM EDTA) containing 5 ng\nof probe per ml was added, and the slide was placed in a moisture chamber and\nincubated for 3 h at 45\u00b0C. Washing was performed by immersing the slide gently\nin ddH2O, and this was followed by incubation in preheated hybridization buffer\nat 45\u00b0C for 20 min. Finally, the slide was rinsed in ddH2O and air dried. The\nslides were mounted in a phosphate-buffered (pH 8.5) medium; the medium\ncontained 20 mg of n-propyl gallate (Sigma Chemical) per ml to prevent fading\nof the \ufb02uorescence. The hybridized bacteria were visualized by epi\ufb02uorescence\nmicroscopy at 3400 or 31,000 magni\ufb01cation on a Leica DMRB microscope\nequipped with a 100-W mercury lamp and an I3 \ufb01lter (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany)\nfor excitation at 450 to 490 nm. Nonhybridized bacteria were hardly detectable\nand were identi\ufb01ed by phase-contrast microscopy. Images were captured with a\nSony (Tokyo, Japan) DXC-930P 3CCD video camera and a Oculus TCX frame\ngrabber (Coreco Inc.). Pictures were processed as tagged-image \ufb01le format\n(TIFF) \ufb01les on a personal computer running Image-Pro software, version 1.3\n(Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, Md.).\nMurine experimental infections and clinical material. Monoinfected murine\nlung and liver tissue samples were prepared by inoculation of bacteria in the\nlateral tail vein as described by Tegtmeier et al. (33). S. typhimurium DVL 3389-1\nand E. coli ATCC 25299 were used for the inoculations. Bacteria from 10 ml of\nnutrient broth were harvested and washed in normal saline (0.9% NaCl). The\nsuspensions were adjusted to 109 CFU/ml by resuspending them in normal saline,\nand the mice received a dose of 0.5 ml. Six-week-old female Balb/c mice were\ninoculated with either E. coli or S. typhimurium; controls received only normal\nsaline. After 10 min, the mice were sacri\ufb01ced by cervical dislocation and their\nlungs and livers were aseptically removed and placed in a sterile petri dish. To\nverify the monoinfection with the inoculated strain, the organism was reisolated\nfrom each organ by plating on BA and Drigalski agar. A sample from each organ\nwas \ufb01xed in 10% buffered formalin for 3 days, embedded in paraf\ufb01n, cut in 3-mm\nslides, and mounted on coated microscope slides (Superfrost1; Menzel-Gla\n\u00a8ser,\nBraunschweig, Germany).\nSamples from pigs and calves with pneumonia or enterocolitis were received at\nthe pathological laboratory at DVL for diagnostic purposes. The samples were\ndelivered un\ufb01xed by ordinary mail and were \ufb01xed in buffered formalin upon\nreceipt.\nIn situ hybridization of tissue specimens. Tissue sections from the experimen-\ntally infected mice or histological sections of clinical material were tested for\nSalmonella by hybridization with Sal3 and Eub338. To test for nonspeci\ufb01c bind-\ning the nonsense probe Non338 was used. The slides were dewaxed twice in xylol\nfor 5 min each time and in 99% ethanol for 5 min. With a DAKO-pen (DAKO,\nGlostrup, Denmark) a circle was drawn around the tissue specimen, and 20 ml of\nhybridization buffer (0.7 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.1% sodium dodecyl\nsulfate, 10 mM EDTA) containing 5 ng of oligonucleotide probe per ml was\nadded. For labelling of all bacteria in the clinical specimen a mixture of \ufb02uores-\ncein-labelled Sal3 and Cy3-labelled Eub338 was added to the same hybridization\nbuffer. The slides were placed in a humid chamber and incubated for 16 h at\n45\u00b0C. Washing, mounting, and detection were performed as described above for\nwhole-cell hybridization. Fluorescent bacteria were detected in the tissue by\nepi\ufb02uorescense microscopy with the G/R \ufb01lter combination (Leica) for the\nsimultaneous excitation of \ufb02uorescein and Cy3 at 490 and 575 nm.\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The sequence data have been depos-\nited in GenBank under accession nos. U88706 (S. typhimurium NVL3389-1),\nU88707 (C. amalonaticus UX31), and U88708 (Proteus mirabilis SN157).\nRESULTS\nrRNA gene sequencing. The middle parts of the 23S rRNA\ngenes (E. coli positions 1243 to 1841) of S. typhimurium, C.\namalonaticus, and P. mirabilis were sequenced and aligned with\nhomologous sequences from other serotypes and species of the\nfamily Enterobacteriaceae. Two regions with high sequence\nvariability were identi\ufb01ed at positions 1470 to 1590 and posi-\ntions 1710 to 1750, respectively. The homologous sequence\nfrom each strain showed a high degree of similarity to the\nsequence of the E. coli 23S rrnB gene (7), con\ufb01rming the close\nrelationship among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.\nWhen calculating absolute similarity, including the similarities\nof hypervariable regions, the S. typhimurium sequence was the\nmost closely related to the C. amalonaticus sequence, with a\nsimilarity of 98%, and to the E. coli sequence, with a similarity\nof 97%, while it was more divergent from the P. mirabilis\nsequence, with a similarity of 90%. When the S. typhimurium\nsequence was aligned with homologous sequences from the\nother Salmonella subspecies, the absolute similarity, including\nthe similarities of hypervariable regions, were 97 to 99.5%,\nwith the highest similarity being to the sequence of subspecies\nI.\nIt was not possible to generate a single probe with a se-\nquence that matched those of serovars of S. enterica for this\npart of the 23S gene. Instead, a probe matching the sequences\nof Salmonella subspecies I, IIIb, and VI but with a single\nmismatch for Salmonella subspecies II and IV and two mis-\nmatches for Salmonella subspecies IIIa was selected. A list of\nthe base compositions within the target area is presented in\nTable 1. The target sequences were similar within each sub-\nspecies with the exception of the sequences of S. tennessee and\nSalmonella subspecies II (S. basel), which each diverged by one\nbase. The sequences of nonsalmonellae all diverged by at least\ntwo mismatches.\nWhole-cell hybridization. The sensitivity and speci\ufb01city of\nthe probe were tested by hybridization with \ufb02uorescence-la-\nbelled probes on smears of formalin-\ufb01xed whole cells (Fig.\n1A). All strains except Staphylococcus aureus were able to\nhybridize with Eub338. Sal3 was tested against 86 Salmonella\nisolates covering 55 serovars from subspecies I to VI. By using\nlow-stringency hybridization and washing conditions, the probe\nhybridized and yielded a strong signal for 80 of 86 Salmonella\nisolates tested (Table 2). As predicted from the alignment of\nthe sequence in the target area (Table 1), the probe hybridized\nto the sequences of the tested serovars of subspecies I, II, IIIb,\nIV, and VI, although the sequences of serovars of subspecies II\nand IV had one mismatch. No hybridization was obtained with\nthe four strains of subspecies IIIa, one strain of subspecies V,\nand one strain of subspecies II (S. basel), which all had two to\nVOL. 35, 1997\nIN SITU HYBRIDIZATION OF SALMONELLA SEROVARS\n2643\n\nthree mismatches (Table 1). No cross hybridization was ob-\nserved to any of 64 other representatives of the family Entero-\nbacteriaceae tested or to 18 bacterial strains outside of the\nfamily Enterobacteriaceae which might occur in the intestinal\ntract of pigs and humans (Table 3).\nIn situ hybridization of tissue specimens. To test the abili-\nties of the probes to hybridize in situ in paraf\ufb01n-embedded\nmaterial, murine tissue experimentally infected with either S.\ntyphimurium or E. coli was prepared. Only tissue from monoin-\nfected organs veri\ufb01ed by bacterial culturing was used in the\ntest. In tissue sections from S. typhimurium-infected mice, a\ndistinct \ufb02uorescent signal from rod-shaped bacteria could be\ndetected when hybridization with Sal3 was performed. Bacteria\ncould be identi\ufb01ed as single cells in the liver sinusoids or in the\nvessels of the lung, as expected from the hematogenous spread\nof the bacteria (Fig. 1B). The same result was achieved when\nhybridization with Eub338 was performed. In the tissue from\nE. coli-infected mice, only Eub338 hybridized to bacteria in the\ntissue, and no signal was obtained when hybridization with Sal3\nwas performed. To test for nonspeci\ufb01c binding of the probe,\ntissue sections were incubated with a nonsense probe, probe\nNon338, which contains the a base sequence complementary to\nthat of Eub338 and which is unable to hybridize to ribosomes.\nWhen using this probe no signal was detected at all, con\ufb01rming\nthe speci\ufb01cities of the probes.\nThe probes were also tested with formalin-\ufb01xed histological\nsections from 15 pigs and calves with histories of pneumonia or\nenterocolitis in which S. typhimurium or S. dublin was found by\ntraditional culture methods (data not shown). For histological\nsections from all animals the salmonella probe hybridized spe-\nci\ufb01cally, and Salmonella bacteria could be seen either as clus-\nters of cells in the necrotic debris or as single cells scattered\nthroughout the in\ufb02amed tissue. In a few instances single bac-\nteria were detected intracellularly as well. In order to show the\nspatial localization of salmonella in relation to the indigenous\nmicro\ufb02ora, the \ufb02uorescein-labelled Sal3 probe was used to-\ngether with a Cy3-labelled universal probe in the same slide\n(Fig. 1C). Salmonella bacteria were detected deep in the lam-\nina propria and in the super\ufb01cial debris, while the indigenous\nmicro\ufb02ora were shown to be localized only super\ufb01cially in the\ndebris. The number of Salmonella bacteria detected in each\nsection varied. In some sections only a few microcolonies were\nfound, while in others numerous bacterial clusters were de-\ntected.\nFor \ufb01ve samples in which Salmonella had not been detected\nby culturing, only Eub338 hybridized to the bacteria. No un-\nspeci\ufb01c binding of the probe was observed when hybridization\nwith the nonsense probe in the clinical material was per-\nformed.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study a speci\ufb01c oligonucleotide probe was\ndeveloped for the in situ detection of S. enterica serovars in\nbacterial smears and in tissue sections by the FISH technique.\nSelection of the probe sequence was based upon alignment of\na sequence segment in the 23S rRNA gene from several sal-\nmonella serotypes and other enterobacterial strains. This seg-\nment was selected because it contains two regions which have\npreviously been shown to exhibit high degrees of sequence\nvariability in bacteria (9, 34). The stringency of the hybridiza-\ntion conditions was chosen so that it would not discriminate\nbetween strains with one mismatch, because this allows for the\nspeci\ufb01c detection of the largest group of S. enterica but does\nTABLE 1.

CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\nnot allow for cross hybridization to any of the closely related\nCitrobacter species or E. coli. Most important, all tested sero-\nvars from subspecies I hybridized with Sal3, because members\nof this subspecies constitute the most commonly encountered\nand the most pathogenic serovars (5, 18).\nThe separation of serovars into seven homology groups or\nsubspecies is based on DNA-DNA hybridization studies (12,\n19). The same separation of serovars has been found when\ncomparing 23S rRNA gene sequences (10); the variations were\nlow within genes from serovars of the same subspecies, but\nthey were three times higher when serovars from different\nsubspecies were compared. On the basis of the assumption that\nthe genetic sequence is highly conserved within each subspe-\ncies, the speci\ufb01city of the probe was tested against 55 serovars\nrepresenting all seven subspecies. This test showed a high\ndegree of conservation in the probe target area, because the\nprobe hybridized only to the subspecies expected from the\nalignment shown in Table 1. However, one strain from sub-\nspecies II failed to hybridize because this strain contained two\nmismatches instead of one, as for the other subspecies II\nstrains.\nSeveral DNA probes used for the detection of Salmonella in\nfood or feces have been published (1, 15, 23). Most probes\ntarget chromosomal or plasmid genes, but oligonucleotide\nprobes targeting the 16S and 23S rRNA have also been pub-\nlished (21, 30, 36). Those probes have been applied in detec-\ntion assays based on denaturated DNA or RNA bound to\nmembranes, eliminating the possibility of the detection and\nspatial localization of single bacterial cells in tissue samples.\nHybridization to ribosomes in situ is highly dependent on\ntarget accessibility (4). Secondary and tertiary structures in the\ncells, as well as protein binding, might prevent hybridization to\nthe ribosome (4), thus making speci\ufb01c probes meant for other\napplications useless for the detection of bacteria by the FISH\ntechnique. The target sequence of Sal3 is located at helix 63,\nand in this study we have shown it to be accessible for in situ\nhybridization of Salmonella.\nFixation is another crucial step for in situ hybridization (4,\n22). The \ufb01xative serves the dual purposes of opening up the\nbacterial wall for probe penetration and protecting the ribo-\nsomes from degradation by endogenous RNase activity. Alde-\nhyde \ufb01xatives are most frequently used with gram-negative\nbacteria (14), whereas alcohol \ufb01xation is recommended for\ngram-positive bacteria (6, 29). In our hands, formalin \ufb01xation\nenabled hybridization of both gram-negative and gram-positive\nbacteria. The exception was S. aureus, for which hybridization\nwith Eub338 was not achieved, probably due to the low level of\npermeability of the cell wall.\nThe use of short oligonucleotide probes reduces the time\nand temperature required for hybridization. By increasing the\nprobe concentration the velocity of the hybridization is further\nincreased; however, this also increases nonspeci\ufb01c staining\n(35). When using an intermediate probe concentration of 1 to\n5 ng/ml, the ribosomes in E. coli were saturated after 2 h of\nincubation with Eub338 (35). When hybridizing to pure cul-\ntures, 3 h of incubation was used, with excellent results. How-\never, for reasons of convenience, the tissue samples were hy-\nbridized overnight.\nTo enhance the level of discrimination of the signal from\nsingle bacteria in tissue sections, we applied a narrow-band-\nFIG. 1.

(C) Tissue section from colon of a\npig with salmonellosis. By hybridizing with a mixture of Sal3 labelled with \ufb02uo-\nrescein and the universal bacterial probe (Eub338) labelled with Cy3, the spatial\nlocalization of salmonella (yellow) can be determined in proportion to the\nindigenous micro\ufb02ora (red).

MICROBIOL.\n\nThe theoretical sensitivity of detection by the FISH tech-\nnique is one bacterium in a 3-mm-thick tissue section; however,\nthe number of bacteria in each tissue section from the clinical\nmaterial varied signi\ufb01cantly. By performing hybridization with\ntissue sections, we were able to detect salmonella bacteria in all\nthe samples which were found to be positive by traditional\nculture methods. However, when dealing with very low num-\nbers of bacteria, the culture method might still be the most\nsensitive method because it contains a preenrichment step.\nDirect detection of bacteria is highly dependent on the\namount and stability of the target, because the intensity of the\nsignal is proportional to the rRNA content (14). Used as a\nresearch tool, the FISH technique has previously been applied\nfor studying the spatial distribution of E. coli or S. typhimurium\nin the intestines of monoinfected mice (20, 27). This was done\nunder optimal research conditions. We found that this tech-\nnique is also applicable for the detection of Salmonella in\nclinical samples. The detection of Salmonella bacteria in tissue\nwas possible even after the paraf\ufb01n-embedding process and in\nthe presence of indigenous micro\ufb02ora. Autolysis of the tissue,\nas a result of the material being shipped un\ufb01xed to the labo-\nratory, did not hinder the detection of the bacteria in our study.\nIn this study we have developed and tested a \ufb02uorescence-\nlabelled oligonucleotide probe for the speci\ufb01c detection of S.\nenterica in clinical samples by in situ hybridization. The stability\nof the ribosome target allowed for the detection of single cells\neven in clinical material, as well as identi\ufb01cation in smears of\npure cultures. The results obtained by use of a readily synthe-\nsized \ufb02uorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probe, combined\nwith a simple hybridization protocol, therefore suggest that the\nFISH technique can be used for the detection of S. enterica\nserovars.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Peter Ahrens for technical support with the sequencing\nand Henning Rasmussen for serotyping, while we thank Anni Ravn\nand Ulla Andreasen for technical assistance in preparing the tissue\nsections.

On the basis of the 23S rRNA gene sequences representing all of the S. enterica\nsubspecies and S. bongori, an 18-mer oligonucleotide probe was selected. The speci\ufb01city of the probe was tested\nby in situ hybridization to bacterial cell smears of pure cultures. Forty-nine of 55 tested Salmonella serovars\nbelonging to subspecies 1, 1I, 1IIb, 1V, and VI hybridized with the probe. The probe did not hybridize to serovars\nfrom subspecies 1IIa (S. arizonae) or to S. bongori. No cross-reaction to 64 other strains of the family\nEnterobacteriaceae or 18 other bacterial strains outside this family was observed. The probe was tested with\nsections of formalin-\ufb01xed, paraf\ufb01n-embedded tissue from experimentally infected mice or from animals with\na history of clinical salmonellosis. 1n these tissue sections the probe hybridized speci\ufb01cally to Salmonella\nserovars, allowing for the detection of single bacterial cells. The development of a \ufb02uorescence-labelled speci\ufb01c\noligonucleotide probe makes the FISH technique a promising tool for the rapid identi\ufb01cation of S. enterica in\nbacterial smears, as well as for the detection of S. enterica in histological tissue sections.\nDifferent serovars of Salmonella have long been recognized\nas major causes of infections in humans and animals, causing a\nvariety of clinical manifestations ranging from mild gastroen-\nteritis to severe sepsis (13). Clinical infection is often followed\nby a subclinical carrier state, in which the convalescing indi-\nvidual may continue to shed salmonellae in feces for a longer\nperiod (11).\nThe genus Salmonella can be divided into seven homology\ngroups by DNA-DNA hybridization studies (12, 19); however,\nthe genus is a large group with respect to antigenicity, consist-\ning of more than 2,300 described serovars (25). As DNA ho-\nmology group V diverges from the others, it has been proposed\nas a new species, Salmonella bongori (28). The remaining sub-\nspecies, subspecies 1, 1I, 1IIa, 1IIb, 1V, and VI, belong to the\nspecies Salmonella enterica. Subspecies 1 is the largest group,\nwith about 59% of the described Salmonella serovars (25),\nincluding all the clinically most relevant serovars (18).\nThe interactions of single bacterial strains in complex eco-\nlogical systems have been studied by \ufb02uorescence in situ hy-\nbridization (FISH) techniques. By hybridizing with \ufb02uores-\ncence-labelled oligonucleotide probes speci\ufb01cally targeting\nribosomes in Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium, the\nspatial distribution of bacteria in the intestinal \ufb02ora of strep-\ntomycin-treated mice has been established (20, 27). However,\nto be able to detect a broad range of clinically relevant Salmo-\nnella serovars by the FISH technique under natural conditions,\na genus-speci\ufb01c RNA-targeted probe is necessary. Such a\nprobe has so far not been available.\nThe ribosomal genes are universally distributed and contain\nhighly conserved regions as well as variable regions, toward\nwhich oligonucleotide probes with various speci\ufb01cities can be\ndeveloped (26, 32). 1n growing bacteria the gene is transcribed\ninto a high number of ribosomes, and following \ufb01xation these\ncan be used as targets for hybridization with short oligonucle-\notide probes (16). By end labelling such probes with \ufb02uores-\ncent molecules, single bacterial cells can be identi\ufb01ed by epi-\n\ufb02uorescence microscopy (14).\nThe purpose of this study was to generate a speci\ufb01c oligo-\nnucleotide probe targeting the different serovars of S. enterica\nby sequencing and aligning 23S rRNA gene sequences and to\nevaluate the applicability of the probe for FISH identi\ufb01cation of\nSalmonella in bacterial smears and detection in formalin-\ufb01xed,\nparaf\ufb01n-embedded specimens from animals with clinical Salmo-\nnella infections.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and culture methods. The strains used to test the speci\ufb01city\nof the oligonucleotide probe are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Salmonella strains were\neither type strains or clinical isolates identi\ufb01ed by serotyping at the Danish\nVeterinary Laboratory (DVL). Other representatives of the family Enterobacte-\nriaceae were type strains or clinical isolates identi\ufb01ed by using the API 20E\nsystem (bioMe\n\u00b4rieux, Marcy, France). Gram-positive test strains were all type\nstrains. The bacteria used to test probe speci\ufb01city and for sequencing were all\ncultured overnight at 37\u00b0C on blood agar (BA; CM331 [Oxoid] supplemented\nwith 5% bovine blood). The strains used to inoculate the experimentally infected\nmice were grown in nutrient broth (CM1 [Difco]) at 37\u00b0C overnight. Samples\nfrom lung and liver were plated on BA and Drigalski agar (17), and the plates\nwere incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C.\nFixation of bacteria for smear hybridization. A single colony from an over-\nnight culture was picked and resuspended in 800 ml of 10% buffered formalin,\nand the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The bacteria were\npelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 3 g for 5 min, washed in 500 ml of 0.1%\nNonidet P-40 (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.), and resuspended in a 1:1 mix-\nture of a storage buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and 96%\nethanol. The \ufb01xed bacteria were stored at 220\u00b0C until use.\nSequencing of rRNA genes of the bacteria. S. typhimurium DVL 3389-1,\nProteus mirabilis SN157, and Citrobacter amalonaticus UX31 were used for par-\ntial sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene. For each isolate a single colony was\npicked and the bacteria were washed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (140\n* Corresponding author.

The bacteria were resuspended in 100 ml of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0],\n1 mM EDTA), lysed by boiling for 10 min, and immediately cooled on ice. The\nlysates were diluted 1:100 in double-distilled H2O (ddH2O), and 2 ml of this\nsolution was added to 50 ml of a PCR mixture consisting of 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM\nMgCl2, 10 pmol of each primer, 100 mM (each) dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP,\nand 0.5 U of polymerase (Amplitaq; Perkin-Elmer) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3).\nPrimers with homology to E. coli were used for PCR ampli\ufb01cation of a segment\nin the 23S rRNA gene; the forward primer, 59-TCAGAAGTGCGAATGC-39,\nwas located at position 1243 (E. coli numbering), and the reverse primer,\n59-AACTTACCCGACAAGG-39, was located at position 1941 (9). Ampli\ufb01ca-\ntion was carried out on a thermocycler, with initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min\nand subsequent ampli\ufb01cation for 34 cycles, with each cycle consisting of ameal-\ning at 45\u00b0C for 1 min, extension at 72\u00b0C for 2 min, and denaturation at 94\u00b0C for\n2 min. The 698-base PCR product was puri\ufb01ed by using QIAquick spin columns\n(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and\nwas veri\ufb01ed by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.\nThe nucleotide sequence of the PCR product was determined by cycle se-\nquencing (31) with an Amplitaq FS dye terminator kit and a 373A automatic\nDNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, Calif.) by using\nthe same primers used for the PCR ampli\ufb01cation. The segments were sequenced\ntwice in both directions.\nSelection of probe sequence. The sequences obtained were aligned with the\npublished E. coli 23S rrnB sequence (7), together with sequences from Salmo-\nnella serovars representing all subspecies (8, 10, 37), Yersinia enterocolitica (10),\nand Citrobacter freundii (10), by using the Sequence Navigator software (Applied\nBiosystems). An 18-mer oligonucleotide probe sequence complementary to the\nregion from positions 1713 to 1730 (E. coli numbering) was selected as being\nspeci\ufb01c for Salmonella subspecies 1, 1IIb, and VI. The theoretical speci\ufb01city was\nchecked by using the CHECK_PROBE program in the RDP Database (24) and\nin the EMBL database by using the Fasta search tool.\nOligonucleotide probes. A Salmonella oligonucleotide probe (Sal3; 59-AATC\nACTTCACCTACGTG-39) the universal bacterial probe (Eub338; 59-GCTGCC\nTCCCGTAGGAGT-39) (3), and a nonsense probe with a sequence complemen-\ntary to Eub338 (Non338; 59-CGACGGAGGGCATCCTCA-39) (35) were used.\nThe probes were all synthesized and labelled with \ufb02uorescein (Sal3 and Non338)\nor the red \ufb02uorescent dye Cy3 (Eub338) at the 59 end (Hobolth DNA syntese,\nHiller\u00f8d, Denmark). The systematic name of the salmonella probe was L-S-Sal-\n1713-a-A-18 (2); however, for reasons of simplicity it is designated Sal3 in this\nreport.\nWhole-cell hybridization. The speci\ufb01city of Sal3 was tested by hybridization\nwith whole bacterial cells. The universal bacterial probe Eub338 served as a\npositive control. Six-well Te\ufb02on-coated slides (NovaKemi, Enskede, Sweden)\nwere coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma Chemical) according to the manufactur-\ner\u2019s instructions. A 1-ml solution of \ufb01xed bacteria was spotted in the wells and air\ndried. Bacteria were dehydrated in 70 and 96% ethanol for 2 min at each\nconcentration. After drying, 8 ml of hybridization solution (0.7 M NaCl, 0.1 M\nTris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 mM EDTA) containing 5 ng\nof probe per ml was added, and the slide was placed in a moisture chamber and\nincubated for 3 h at 45\u00b0C. Washing was performed by immersing the slide gently\nin ddH2O, and this was followed by incubation in preheated hybridization buffer\nat 45\u00b0C for 20 min. Finally, the slide was rinsed in ddH2O and air dried. The\nslides were mounted in a phosphate-buffered (pH 8.5) medium; the medium\ncontained 20 mg of n-propyl gallate (Sigma Chemical) per ml to prevent fading\nof the \ufb02uorescence. The hybridized bacteria were visualized by epi\ufb02uorescence\nmicroscopy at 3400 or 31,000 magni\ufb01cation on a Leica DMRB microscope\nequipped with a 100-W mercury lamp and an 13 \ufb01lter (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany)\nfor excitation at 450 to 490 nm. Nonhybridized bacteria were hardly detectable\nand were identi\ufb01ed by phase-contrast microscopy. 1mages were captured with a\nSony (Tokyo, Japan) DXC-930P 3CCD video camera and a Oculus TCX frame\ngrabber (Coreco 1nc.). Pictures were processed as tagged-image \ufb01le format\n(TIFF) \ufb01les on a personal computer ruming 1mage-Pro software, version 1.3\n(Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, Md.).\nMurine experimental infections and clinical material. Monoinfected murine\nlung and liver tissue samples were prepared by inoculation of bacteria in the\nlateral tail vein as described by Tegtmeier et al. (33). S. typhimurium DVL 3389-1\nand E. coli ATCC 25299 were used for the inoculations. Bacteria from 10 ml of\nnutrient broth were harvested and washed in normal saline (0.9% NaCl). The\nsuspensions were adjusted to 109 CFU/ml by resuspending them in normal saline,\nand the mice received a dose of 0.5 ml. Six-week-old female Balb/c mice were\ninoculated with either E. coli or S. typhimurium; controls received only normal\nsaline. After 10 min, the mice were sacri\ufb01ced by cervical dislocation and their\nlungs and livers were aseptically removed and placed in a sterile petri dish. To\nverify the monoinfection with the inoculated strain, the organism was reisolated\nfrom each organ by plating on BA and Drigalski agar. A sample from each organ\nwas \ufb01xed in 10% buffered formalin for 3 days, embedded in paraf\ufb01n, cut in 3-mm\nslides, and mounted on coated microscope slides (Superfrost1; Menzel-Gla\n\u00a8ser,\nBraunschweig, Germany).\nSamples from pigs and calves with pneumonia or enterocolitis were received at\nthe pathological laboratory at DVL for diagnostic purposes. The samples were\ndelivered un\ufb01xed by ordinary mail and were \ufb01xed in buffered formalin upon\nreceipt. 1n situ hybridization of tissue specimens. Tissue sections from the experimen-\ntally infected mice or histological sections of clinical material were tested for\nSalmonella by hybridization with Sal3 and Eub338. To test for nonspeci\ufb01c bind-\ning the nonsense probe Non338 was used. The slides were dewaxed twice in xylol\nfor 5 min each time and in 99% ethanol for 5 min. With a DAKO-pen (DAKO,\nGlostrup, Denmark) a circle was drawn around the tissue specimen, and 20 ml of\nhybridization buffer (0.7 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.1% sodium dodecyl\nsulfate, 10 mM EDTA) containing 5 ng of oligonucleotide probe per ml was\nadded. For labelling of all bacteria in the clinical specimen a mixture of \ufb02uores-\ncein-labelled Sal3 and Cy3-labelled Eub338 was added to the same hybridization\nbuffer. The slides were placed in a humid chamber and incubated for 16 h at\n45\u00b0C. Washing, mounting, and detection were performed as described above for\nwhole-cell hybridization. Fluorescent bacteria were detected in the tissue by\nepi\ufb02uorescense microscopy with the G/R \ufb01lter combination (Leica) for the\nsimultaneous excitation of \ufb02uorescein and Cy3 at 490 and 575 nm.\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The sequence data have been depos-\nited in GenBank under accession nos. U88706 (S. typhimurium NVL3389-1),\nU88707 (C. amalonaticus UX31), and U88708 (Proteus mirabilis SN157).\nRESULTS\nrRNA gene sequencing. The middle parts of the 23S rRNA\ngenes (E. coli positions 1243 to 1841) of S. typhimurium, C.\namalonaticus, and P. mirabilis were sequenced and aligned with\nhomologous sequences from other serotypes and species of the\nfamily Enterobacteriaceae. Two regions with high sequence\nvariability were identi\ufb01ed at positions 1470 to 1590 and posi-\ntions 1710 to 1750, respectively. The homologous sequence\nfrom each strain showed a high degree of similarity to the\nsequence of the E. coli 23S rrnB gene (7), con\ufb01rming the close\nrelationship among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.\nWhen calculating absolute similarity, including the similarities\nof hypervariable regions, the S. typhimurium sequence was the\nmost closely related to the C. amalonaticus sequence, with a\nsimilarity of 98%, and to the E. coli sequence, with a similarity\nof 97%, while it was more divergent from the P. mirabilis\nsequence, with a similarity of 90%. When the S. typhimurium\nsequence was aligned with homologous sequences from the\nother Salmonella subspecies, the absolute similarity, including\nthe similarities of hypervariable regions, were 97 to 99.5%,\nwith the highest similarity being to the sequence of subspecies 1. 1t was not possible to generate a single probe with a se-\nquence that matched those of serovars of S. enterica for this\npart of the 23S gene. 1nstead, a probe matching the sequences\nof Salmonella subspecies 1, 1IIb, and VI but with a single\nmismatch for Salmonella subspecies 1I and 1V and two mis-\nmatches for Salmonella subspecies 1IIa was selected. A list of\nthe base compositions within the target area is presented in\nTable 1. The target sequences were similar within each sub-\nspecies with the exception of the sequences of S. temessee and\nSalmonella subspecies 1I (S. basel), which each diverged by one\nbase. The sequences of nonsalmonellae all diverged by at least\ntwo mismatches.\nWhole-cell hybridization. The sensitivity and speci\ufb01city of\nthe probe were tested by hybridization with \ufb02uorescence-la-\nbelled probes on smears of formalin-\ufb01xed whole cells (Fig.\n1A). All strains except Staphylococcus aureus were able to\nhybridize with Eub338. Sal3 was tested against 86 Salmonella\nisolates covering 55 serovars from subspecies 1 to VI. By using\nlow-stringency hybridization and washing conditions, the probe\nhybridized and yielded a strong signal for 80 of 86 Salmonella\nisolates tested (Table 2). As predicted from the alignment of\nthe sequence in the target area (Table 1), the probe hybridized\nto the sequences of the tested serovars of subspecies 1, 1I, 1IIb, 1V, and VI, although the sequences of serovars of subspecies 1I\nand 1V had one mismatch. No hybridization was obtained with\nthe four strains of subspecies 1IIa, one strain of subspecies V,\nand one strain of subspecies 1I (S. basel), which all had two to\nVOL. 35, 1997 1N SITU HYBRIDIZATION OF SALMONELLA SEROVARS\n2643\n\nthree mismatches (Table 1). No cross hybridization was ob-\nserved to any of 64 other representatives of the family Entero-\nbacteriaceae tested or to 18 bacterial strains outside of the\nfamily Enterobacteriaceae which might occur in the intestinal\ntract of pigs and humans (Table 3). 1n situ hybridization of tissue specimens. To test the abili-\nties of the probes to hybridize in situ in paraf\ufb01n-embedded\nmaterial, murine tissue experimentally infected with either S.\ntyphimurium or E. coli was prepared. Only tissue from monoin-\nfected organs veri\ufb01ed by bacterial culturing was used in the\ntest. 1n tissue sections from S. typhimurium-infected mice, a\ndistinct \ufb02uorescent signal from rod-shaped bacteria could be\ndetected when hybridization with Sal3 was performed. Bacteria\ncould be identi\ufb01ed as single cells in the liver sinusoids or in the\nvessels of the lung, as expected from the hematogenous spread\nof the bacteria (Fig. 1B). The same result was achieved when\nhybridization with Eub338 was performed. 1n the tissue from\nE. coli-infected mice, only Eub338 hybridized to bacteria in the\ntissue, and no signal was obtained when hybridization with Sal3\nwas performed. To test for nonspeci\ufb01c binding of the probe,\ntissue sections were incubated with a nonsense probe, probe\nNon338, which contains the a base sequence complementary to\nthat of Eub338 and which is unable to hybridize to ribosomes.\nWhen using this probe no signal was detected at all, con\ufb01rming\nthe speci\ufb01cities of the probes.\nThe probes were also tested with formalin-\ufb01xed histological\nsections from 15 pigs and calves with histories of pneumonia or\nenterocolitis in which S. typhimurium or S. dublin was found by\ntraditional culture methods (data not shown). For histological\nsections from all animals the salmonella probe hybridized spe-\nci\ufb01cally, and Salmonella bacteria could be seen either as clus-\nters of cells in the necrotic debris or as single cells scattered\nthroughout the in\ufb02amed tissue. 1n a few instances single bac-\nteria were detected intracellularly as well. 1n order to show the\nspatial localization of salmonella in relation to the indigenous\nmicro\ufb02ora, the \ufb02uorescein-labelled Sal3 probe was used to-\ngether with a Cy3-labelled universal probe in the same slide\n(Fig. 1C). Salmonella bacteria were detected deep in the lam-\nina propria and in the super\ufb01cial debris, while the indigenous\nmicro\ufb02ora were shown to be localized only super\ufb01cially in the\ndebris. The number of Salmonella bacteria detected in each\nsection varied. 1n some sections only a few microcolonies were\nfound, while in others numerous bacterial clusters were de-\ntected.\nFor \ufb01ve samples in which Salmonella had not been detected\nby culturing, only Eub338 hybridized to the bacteria. No un-\nspeci\ufb01c binding of the probe was observed when hybridization\nwith the nonsense probe in the clinical material was per-\nformed.\nDISCUSSION 1n the present study a speci\ufb01c oligonucleotide probe was\ndeveloped for the in situ detection of S. enterica serovars in\nbacterial smears and in tissue sections by the FISH technique.\nSelection of the probe sequence was based upon alignment of\na sequence segment in the 23S rRNA gene from several sal-\nmonella serotypes and other enterobacterial strains. This seg-\nment was selected because it contains two regions which have\npreviously been shown to exhibit high degrees of sequence\nvariability in bacteria (9, 34). The stringency of the hybridiza-\ntion conditions was chosen so that it would not discriminate\nbetween strains with one mismatch, because this allows for the\nspeci\ufb01c detection of the largest group of S. enterica but does\nTABLE 1.

CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\nnot allow for cross hybridization to any of the closely related\nCitrobacter species or E. coli. Most important, all tested sero-\nvars from subspecies 1 hybridized with Sal3, because members\nof this subspecies constitute the most commonly encountered\nand the most pathogenic serovars (5, 18).\nThe separation of serovars into seven homology groups or\nsubspecies is based on DNA-DNA hybridization studies (12,\n19). The same separation of serovars has been found when\ncomparing 23S rRNA gene sequences (10); the variations were\nlow within genes from serovars of the same subspecies, but\nthey were three times higher when serovars from different\nsubspecies were compared. On the basis of the assumption that\nthe genetic sequence is highly conserved within each subspe-\ncies, the speci\ufb01city of the probe was tested against 55 serovars\nrepresenting all seven subspecies. This test showed a high\ndegree of conservation in the probe target area, because the\nprobe hybridized only to the subspecies expected from the\nalignment shown in Table 1. However, one strain from sub-\nspecies 1I failed to hybridize because this strain contained two\nmismatches instead of one, as for the other subspecies 1I\nstrains.\nSeveral DNA probes used for the detection of Salmonella in\nfood or feces have been published (1, 15, 23). Most probes\ntarget chromosomal or plasmid genes, but oligonucleotide\nprobes targeting the 16S and 23S rRNA have also been pub-\nlished (21, 30, 36). Those probes have been applied in detec-\ntion assays based on denaturated DNA or RNA bound to\nmembranes, eliminating the possibility of the detection and\nspatial localization of single bacterial cells in tissue samples.\nHybridization to ribosomes in situ is highly dependent on\ntarget accessibility (4). Secondary and tertiary structures in the\ncells, as well as protein binding, might prevent hybridization to\nthe ribosome (4), thus making speci\ufb01c probes meant for other\napplications useless for the detection of bacteria by the FISH\ntechnique. The target sequence of Sal3 is located at helix 63,\nand in this study we have shown it to be accessible for in situ\nhybridization of Salmonella.\nFixation is another crucial step for in situ hybridization (4,\n22). The \ufb01xative serves the dual purposes of opening up the\nbacterial wall for probe penetration and protecting the ribo-\nsomes from degradation by endogenous RNase activity. Alde-\nhyde \ufb01xatives are most frequently used with gram-negative\nbacteria (14), whereas alcohol \ufb01xation is recommended for\ngram-positive bacteria (6, 29). 1n our hands, formalin \ufb01xation\nenabled hybridization of both gram-negative and gram-positive\nbacteria. The exception was S. aureus, for which hybridization\nwith Eub338 was not achieved, probably due to the low level of\npermeability of the cell wall.\nThe use of short oligonucleotide probes reduces the time\nand temperature required for hybridization. By increasing the\nprobe concentration the velocity of the hybridization is further\nincreased; however, this also increases nonspeci\ufb01c staining\n(35). When using an intermediate probe concentration of 1 to\n5 ng/ml, the ribosomes in E. coli were saturated after 2 h of\nincubation with Eub338 (35). When hybridizing to pure cul-\ntures, 3 h of incubation was used, with excellent results. How-\never, for reasons of convenience, the tissue samples were hy-\nbridized overnight.\nTo enhance the level of discrimination of the signal from\nsingle bacteria in tissue sections, we applied a narrow-band-\nFIG. 1.

By hybridizing with a mixture of Sal3 labelled with \ufb02uo-\nrescein and the universal bacterial probe (Eub338) labelled with Cy3, the spatial\nlocalization of salmonella (yellow) can be determined in proportion to the\nindigenous micro\ufb02ora (red).

(28).\n2646\nNORDENTOFT ET AL.\nJ. CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\nThe theoretical sensitivity of detection by the FISH tech-\nnique is one bacterium in a 3-mm-thick tissue section; however,\nthe number of bacteria in each tissue section from the clinical\nmaterial varied signi\ufb01cantly. By performing hybridization with\ntissue sections, we were able to detect salmonella bacteria in all\nthe samples which were found to be positive by traditional\nculture methods. However, when dealing with very low num-\nbers of bacteria, the culture method might still be the most\nsensitive method because it contains a preenrichment step.\nDirect detection of bacteria is highly dependent on the\namount and stability of the target, because the intensity of the\nsignal is proportional to the rRNA content (14). Used as a\nresearch tool, the FISH technique has previously been applied\nfor studying the spatial distribution of E. coli or S. typhimurium\nin the intestines of monoinfected mice (20, 27). This was done\nunder optimal research conditions. We found that this tech-\nnique is also applicable for the detection of Salmonella in\nclinical samples. The detection of Salmonella bacteria in tissue\nwas possible even after the paraf\ufb01n-embedding process and in\nthe presence of indigenous micro\ufb02ora. Autolysis of the tissue,\nas a result of the material being shipped un\ufb01xed to the labo-\nratory, did not hinder the detection of the bacteria in our study. 1n this study we have developed and tested a \ufb02uorescence-\nlabelled oligonucleotide probe for the speci\ufb01c detection of S.\nenterica in clinical samples by in situ hybridization. The stability\nof the ribosome target allowed for the detection of single cells\neven in clinical material, as well as identi\ufb01cation in smears of\npure cultures. The results obtained by use of a readily synthe-\nsized \ufb02uorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probe, combined\nwith a simple hybridization protocol, therefore suggest that the\nFISH technique can be used for the detection of S. enterica\nserovars.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Peter Ahrens for technical support with the sequencing\nand Heming Rasmussen for serotyping, while we thank Ami Ravn\nand Ulla Andreasen for technical assistance in preparing the tissue\nsections.

Palo Alto, Calif.]) were evaluated for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis in urine specimens from\nasymptomatic males. Assay results were compared with direct specimen immunofluorescence (DFA) analysis of\nurine sediment (Syva Microtrak; Syva Co.), which was chosen as the study confirmation assay. An overall\nChlamydia prevalence of 7% (24 of 340) was found in our study population, with peak incidences occurring in\nthe adolescent (8 of 93 specimens) and young adult (11 of 146 specimens) age groups. Sensitivity and specificity\ndata among the Chlamydiazyme, 1DEIA, and Microtrak enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) were determined to be\n79.1 and 99%o, 91.7 and 98%, and 95.8 and 99%o, respectively. The Microtrak EIA and 1DEIA products\ndemonstrated sensitivities and specificities equal to or greater than those claimed for urine specimens. The\ndiagnostic accuracies of these assays on asymptomatic subjects, along with the ease of this collection method,\nsuggest a role for these products as screening tools. The sensitivity of the Chlamydiazyme assay was lower than\nthat claimed previously in symptomatic patients, with 5 of 24 positive specimens demonstrating false-negative\nresults. 1n those cases, centrifugation of the original immunoassay aliquot material and then DFA examination\nconfirmed specimen positivity. Urine immunoassay screening in combination with DFA confirmation (which\nwas chosen because it has antibody epitopic specificity different from that of the primary assay) provides a high\ndegree of diagnostic precision. The use of noninvasive collection methods could result in greater testing\ncompliance among asymptomatic males and, subsequently, could reduce the incidences of both symptomatic\nand silent chlamydial infections.\nChlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular patho-\ngen and has been recognized as a major etiologic agent of\nsexually transmitted disease (6). Genital chlamydial infec-\ntions in females have been associated with cervicitis, endo-\nmetritis, salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infer-\ntility (6, 12). 1nfections in males may include nongonococcal\nand postgonococcal urethritis, epididymitis, and prostatitis\n(2, 3). 1n addition to overt clinical symptoms, a silent or\nasymptomatic response can occur (2, 3, 5, 18).\nThe prevalence of C. trachomatis is highest among sexu-\nally active adolescents, with an asymptomatic carriage rate\nranging between 6 and 15%\n(2, 3, 5, 10, 17,\n18). The\nsignificant health problems and staggering health care costs\nassociated with this large asymptomatic reservoir of infec-\ntion have resulted in calls for the institution of diagnostic\nscreening programs (2, 13). Compliance with testing among\nasymptomatic males has been problematic, in part because\nof the traumatic, invasive nature of the techniques used for\nspecimen collection (2, 10, 18).\nNoninvasive techniques, including those that demonstrate\nthe presence of pyuria, by cytometric and microscopic\nmethods have generally produced unfavorable or incomplete\nresults when compared with urethral swab cultures (2, 3).\nMeasurement of urinary leukocyte esterase, while having\nbeen shown to be procedurally simple and cost-effective, has\n* Corresponding author.\na reported sensitivity that ranges from 72 to 100% (10, 14, 17,\n18). Although these methods offer noninvasive approaches\nto specimen collection, failure to specify etiologic causation\nlimits their value in diagnostic evaluation.\nDirect specimen immunofluorescence (DFA)-monoclonal\nantibody examination of urine sediment provides a highly\naccurate, noninvasive Chlamydia identification method (8,\n9, 15). The morphologic detection of noninfectious elemen-\ntary bodies by DFA offers advantages over culture isolation\nmethods, which require organismic viability (8, 9). Unfortu-\nnately, the labor intensity and technical skills required for\nDFA limit its value as a routine screening tool.\nThe detection of C. trachomatis in male urine specimens\nby enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) has recently become pos-\nsible (4, 11, 16). These assays are rapid, cost-effective, and\nrelatively non-labor-intensive tools which specify chlamyd-\nial infections. Comparison of these methods with culture\nisolation has demonstrated similar detection frequencies in\nmales; however, a great reduction in the sensitivities of the\nEIAs occurs in female urine specimens (1, 11). The perfor-\nmance findings between the sexes is not surprising, because\nanatomical differences can additionally allow for cervical\nand endocervical chlamydial involvement. 1nfection at those\nsites, potentially without any urethral involvement, has\nprecluded urine testing in females.\nPrevious investigations that compared enzymatic urine\nanalysis with urethral culture isolation have demonstrated\nsignificant variations in the performance of individual assay\n2793\n\n2794\nLEONARDI ET AL.\nproducts (4, 11, 16). Those early studies must be carefully\nevaluated because the establishment or modification of man-\nufacturers' procedures (including the use of confirmation\nassays) may have occurred subsequent to their publication.\nThe purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the\nproduct performance of three commercially available immu-\nnoassays for the detection of C. trachomatis by using urine\nspecimens from asymptomatic males. EIA sensitivity and\nspecificity with respect to this group and specimen type were\nincomplete, despite recommendations of health profession-\nals for the institution of screening regimens designed with\nthe use of noninvasive methods.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy population. A total of 340 asymptomatic male vol-\nunteers was recruited from patient clinics (Adolescent Med-\nicine, Employee's Health, 1nfectious Diseases) at the Nas-\nsau\nCounty\nMedical\nCenter\nand\nthe\nNassau\nCounty\nDepartment of Health facilities. Following an interview with\na physician, an informed consent containing both age data\nand a result notification option (if so desired) was signed\nprior to enrollment.\nPotential donors were excluded if they gave no prior\nhistory of sexual intercourse, if they had received antimicro-\nbial therapy in the previous month, or if symptoms consis-\ntent with urethritis were present. Approval of the study was\ngranted by the Medical Center institutional Grants and\nResearch Committee.\nSpecimen collection and handling. A urine specimen (50 to\n60 ml) was collected in a sterile container, refrigerated, and\nprocessed within 48 h. Participants had not urinated for at\nleast 1 h prior to urine donation.\nBulk urine specimens were vigorously vortexed for at\nleast 30 s prior to being divided into aliquots (15 ml) among\nthree centrifuge tubes. The remaining urine specimen (at\nleast 5 ml) was placed in a fourth tube for testing by DFA.\nSpecimens containing less than a 50-ml volume were ex-\ncluded from testing.\nFollowing aliquot centrifugation (3,000 x g for 30 min),\nthe supernatants were removed and the appropriate assay\nspecimen dilution buffer was added to each tube. Sediment\nfrom the DFA tube was washed in phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS), recentrifuged as described above, and resuspended in\na 0.2- to 0.5-ml volume of PBS (11). A drop of this suspen-\nsion was placed onto a Teflon-coated slide (Carlson Scien-\ntific, Peotine, 1ll.), air dried, and fixed in methanol for 5 min.\nEIA procedures. Three commercially available immunoas-\nsays (Chlamydiazyme/Antibody Blocking Assay; lot 51022\nM100 [Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, 1ll.]; 1DEIA; lot\n115101 [Analytab Products, Plainview, N.Y.]; and Microtrak\nEIA; lot 8H619-D29 [Syva Co., Palo Alto, Calif.]) approved\nfor testing for C. trachomatis in male urine were evaluated.\nAll\nassays\ncontained\ngenus-specific\nantibodies\ndirected\nagainst the lipopolysaccharide component of C. trachoma-\ntis. The 1DEIA product incorporates monoclonal-mono-\nclonal antibody capture technology, whereas the Syva and\nChlamydiazyrne assays use polyclonal antibody capture\nmethods. Assay procedures were done by the protocol for\neach product, which included the use of a blocking assay to\nconfirm Chlamydiazyme-positive specimens. Spectrophoto-\nmetric results were obtained by using equipment supplied for\neach assay (Quantum 1I for Chlamydiazyme, EL312e Bio\nTek reader for 1DEIA, and Microtrak autoreader for Micro-\ntrak EIA). A recently approved 90-min protocol was used for 1DEIA.\nTABLE 1.

DFA testing of urine sediment\nwas chosen as the study confirmation assay, as described\npreviously (11). A fluorescent-labeled monoclonal antibody\n(Microtrak, lot 8H149-C2D; Syva Co.) directed against a\ndifferent epitope (major outer membrane protein) than those\nused in the assays under investigation was selected. A slide\nwas prepared for each test specimen. 1n addition, direct\nspecimen testing of the original immunoassay aliquot was\ndone when discrepancies among products arose.\nSlide wells were scanned at a x400 magnification by using\na Nikon Labophot episcopic microscope equipped with a\n460- to 490-nm immunofluorescence excitation filter (Nikon 1nc., Garden City, N.Y.). The presence of elementary bod-\nies was confirmed under oil immersion. Specimen and con-\ntrol slides were coded to prevent potential bias of the results.\nSpecimens containing at least two Chlamydia elementary\nbodies demonstrating both proper morphology and immuno-\nfluorescence intensity were judged to be positive.\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of C. trachomatis among our study popu-\nlation is given in Table 1. An overall prevalence of 7% (24 of\n340) was obtained, with the highest infection rate (8.6%)\nfound among adolescents (ages 13 to 20 years). A similar\nincidence (7.5%) was observed in young adults (ages 21 to 30\nyears) but was reduced in older men. Age data for 20\nsubjects, including one positive study participant, could not\nbe ascertained.\nComparative immunoassay performances are summarized\nin Table 2. Measurements of the sensitivities and specifici-\nties of the Chlamydiazyme, 1DEIA, and Microtrak products\nwere found to be 79.1 and 99%, 91.7 and 98%, and 95.8 and\n99%, respectively. 1mmunoassay results were routinely compared with DFA\nfindings and demonstrated a high degree of correlation. On\none occasion, a positive result was recorded by all immu-\nnoassays but failed confirmation by DFA. This specimen\nwas considered positive, and the DFA finding was thought to\nbe attributable to a possible sampling error. 1n situations in which discrepancies in results among\nproducts arose, portions of the original immunoassay aliquot\nwere also prepared and analyzed by DFA. This examination\nproved valuable, because the original immunoassay aliquot\nmaterial from seven of eight patients with reportedly nega-\ntive immunoassay results demonstrated elementary bodies\navailable for antigen detection.

Aliquots from false-positive specimens\nwere never demonstrated to have elementary bodies by\nDFA. The process of aliquot boiling used by two products\n(IDEIA, Microtrak EIA) did not appreciably alter elemen-\ntary body morphology or fluorescence.\nThe 1DEIA and Microtrak assays demonstrated perfor-\nmances equal to or better than those claimed by the litera-\nture for the respective products. The sensitivity of Chlamy-\ndiazyme was below product claims for symptomatic males,\nwith 5 false-negative results occurring among 24 confirmed\npositive specimens. 1n those cases, spectrophotometric ab-\nsorbances were higher than those found for true-negative\nspecimens, but they failed to reach positive cutoff values.\nDISCUSSION\nA Chlamydia screening program must use a diagnostic\napproach which is simple to perform, highly accurate, inex-\npensive, and noninvasive (15). 1n this study we examined the\nability of commercially available EIAs to satisfy these crite-\nria. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Micro-\ntrak EIA and 1DEIA in detecting C. trachomatis in urine\nspecimens from asymptomatic males.\nThe 1DEIA product has previously demonstrated sensitiv-\nities and specificities of 100 and 100%, and 81.6 and 100% in\nstudies involving 62 and 224 symptomatic men, respectively\n(4, 11). A similar investigation involving 348 symptomatic\nmen reported sensitivities and specificities of 87 and 97%, 76\nand 97%, and 71 and 98% for the Microtrak EIA, 1DEIA,\nand Chlamydiazyme products, respectively (7). The result-\ning assay performance rank for symptomatic men was iden-\ntical to that found in this study of asymptomatic individuals.\nEvaluation of the Chlamydiazyme product resulted in a\n79.1% sensitivity. This value is situated between numerous\nreported sensitivities ranging from 42 to 88% when male\nurine specimens are used (1, 4, 7, 11, 14-16). The poor\nsensitivity obtained for the Chlamydiazyme product (42%) in\none study led investigators to suggest that urine immunoas-\nsay methods may be unsuitable for screening asymptomatic\nindividuals (14). One explanation for this significant reduc-\ntion in sensitivity may result from the methodology used to\nobtain study material. The collection of two urethral swabs\nprior to urine donation may have erroneously biased the\navailable detection material (elementary bodies and antigen)\nin favor of the culture isolation method. Although a reduced\nsensitivity of the Chlamydiazyme assay compared with\nthose of the Microtrak and 1DEIA assays was also found in\nthe current investigation, the performances of the Microtrak\nand 1DEIA assays suggest their potential for use as screen-\ning tools.\nA basic difficulty encountered in comparative product\ninvestigations is the potential for specimen collection bias,\nwhich may obscure the accuracy of study results (11). The\nuse of urine eliminated errors associated with multiple\nand/or improper sampling and essentially presented each test\nproduct with an equal amount of detectable antigen. This\nspecimen source also allowed a clear determination of how\neach assay would perform under noninvasive screening\nconditions.\nUnder these conditions, we found a 7% C. trachomatis\ncarriage rate among asymptomatic individuals in our study\npopulation. This infection rate is lower than that described\npreviously (2, 3, 5, 18); however, in the present investiga-\ntion, we did not place any age restrictions on study partici-\npants. The observed infection rate in young adults (ages 21\nto 30 years) was relatively equal to that in adolescents (ages\n13 to 20 years). Although the target screening groups for C.\ntrachomatis have traditionally been adolescents, the findings\npresented above suggest that young adults should also be\nincluded. 1n summary, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe Microtrak ETA and 1DEIA immunoassay products for\nthe accurate detection of C. trachomatis in asymptomatic\nmen and suggest their possible role as screening tools. The\nuse of this noninvasive specimen source could result in\ngreater testing compliance in Chlamydia screening and could\nreduce this pathogen's spread in adolescents and young\nadults.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge Amy Tan, Lois Profundi, and Lyn\nBenner for efforts in obtaining and handling study specimens.\nREFERENCES\n1.

The sensitivity of the Chlamydiazyme assay was lower than\nthat claimed previously in symptomatic patients, with 5 of 24 positive specimens demonstrating false-negative\nresults. In those cases, centrifugation of the original immunoassay aliquot material and then DFA examination\nconfirmed specimen positivity. Urine immunoassay screening in combination with DFA confirmation (which\nwas chosen because it has antibody epitopic specificity different from that of the primary assay) provides a high\ndegree of diagnostic precision. The use of noninvasive collection methods could result in greater testing\ncompliance among asymptomatic males and, subsequently, could reduce the incidences of both symptomatic\nand silent chlamydial infections.\nChlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular patho-\ngen and has been recognized as a major etiologic agent of\nsexually transmitted disease (6). Genital chlamydial infec-\ntions in females have been associated with cervicitis, endo-\nmetritis, salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infer-\ntility (6, 12). Infections in males may include nongonococcal\nand postgonococcal urethritis, epididymitis, and prostatitis\n(2, 3). In addition to overt clinical symptoms, a silent or\nasymptomatic response can occur (2, 3, 5, 18).\nThe prevalence of C. trachomatis is highest among sexu-\nally active adolescents, with an asymptomatic carriage rate\nranging between 6 and 15%\n(2, 3, 5, 10, 17,\n18). The\nsignificant health problems and staggering health care costs\nassociated with this large asymptomatic reservoir of infec-\ntion have resulted in calls for the institution of diagnostic\nscreening programs (2, 13). Compliance with testing among\nasymptomatic males has been problematic, in part because\nof the traumatic, invasive nature of the techniques used for\nspecimen collection (2, 10, 18).\nNoninvasive techniques, including those that demonstrate\nthe presence of pyuria, by cytometric and microscopic\nmethods have generally produced unfavorable or incomplete\nresults when compared with urethral swab cultures (2, 3).\nMeasurement of urinary leukocyte esterase, while having\nbeen shown to be procedurally simple and cost-effective, has\n* Corresponding author.\na reported sensitivity that ranges from 72 to 100% (10, 14, 17,\n18). Although these methods offer noninvasive approaches\nto specimen collection, failure to specify etiologic causation\nlimits their value in diagnostic evaluation.\nDirect specimen immunofluorescence (DFA)-monoclonal\nantibody examination of urine sediment provides a highly\naccurate, noninvasive Chlamydia identification method (8,\n9, 15). The morphologic detection of noninfectious elemen-\ntary bodies by DFA offers advantages over culture isolation\nmethods, which require organismic viability (8, 9). Unfortu-\nnately, the labor intensity and technical skills required for\nDFA limit its value as a routine screening tool.\nThe detection of C. trachomatis in male urine specimens\nby enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) has recently become pos-\nsible (4, 11, 16). These assays are rapid, cost-effective, and\nrelatively non-labor-intensive tools which specify chlamyd-\nial infections. Comparison of these methods with culture\nisolation has demonstrated similar detection frequencies in\nmales; however, a great reduction in the sensitivities of the\nEIAs occurs in female urine specimens (1, 11). The perfor-\nmance findings between the sexes is not surprising, because\nanatomical differences can additionally allow for cervical\nand endocervical chlamydial involvement. Infection at those\nsites, potentially without any urethral involvement, has\nprecluded urine testing in females.\nPrevious investigations that compared enzymatic urine\nanalysis with urethral culture isolation have demonstrated\nsignificant variations in the performance of individual assay\n2793\n\n2794\nLEONARDI ET AL.\nproducts (4, 11, 16). Those early studies must be carefully\nevaluated because the establishment or modification of man-\nufacturers' procedures (including the use of confirmation\nassays) may have occurred subsequent to their publication.\nThe purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the\nproduct performance of three commercially available immu-\nnoassays for the detection of C. trachomatis by using urine\nspecimens from asymptomatic males. EIA sensitivity and\nspecificity with respect to this group and specimen type were\nincomplete, despite recommendations of health profession-\nals for the institution of screening regimens designed with\nthe use of noninvasive methods.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy population. A total of 340 asymptomatic male vol-\nunteers was recruited from patient clinics (Adolescent Med-\nicine, Employee's Health, Infectious Diseases) at the Nas-\nsau\nCounty\nMedical\nCenter\nand\nthe\nNassau\nCounty\nDepartment of Health facilities. Following an interview with\na physician, an informed consent containing both age data\nand a result notification option (if so desired) was signed\nprior to enrollment.\nPotential donors were excluded if they gave no prior\nhistory of sexual intercourse, if they had received antimicro-\nbial therapy in the previous month, or if symptoms consis-\ntent with urethritis were present. Approval of the study was\ngranted by the Medical Center institutional Grants and\nResearch Committee.\nSpecimen collection and handling. A urine specimen (50 to\n60 ml) was collected in a sterile container, refrigerated, and\nprocessed within 48 h. Participants had not urinated for at\nleast 1 h prior to urine donation.\nBulk urine specimens were vigorously vortexed for at\nleast 30 s prior to being divided into aliquots (15 ml) among\nthree centrifuge tubes. The remaining urine specimen (at\nleast 5 ml) was placed in a fourth tube for testing by DFA.\nSpecimens containing less than a 50-ml volume were ex-\ncluded from testing.\nFollowing aliquot centrifugation (3,000 x g for 30 min),\nthe supernatants were removed and the appropriate assay\nspecimen dilution buffer was added to each tube. Sediment\nfrom the DFA tube was washed in phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS), recentrifuged as described above, and resuspended in\na 0.2- to 0.5-ml volume of PBS (11). A drop of this suspen-\nsion was placed onto a Teflon-coated slide (Carlson Scien-\ntific, Peotine, Ill.), air dried, and fixed in methanol for 5 min.\nEIA procedures. Three commercially available immunoas-\nsays (Chlamydiazyme/Antibody Blocking Assay; lot 51022\nM100 [Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Ill.]; IDEIA; lot\n115101 [Analytab Products, Plainview, N.Y.]; and Microtrak\nEIA; lot 8H619-D29 [Syva Co., Palo Alto, Calif.]) approved\nfor testing for C. trachomatis in male urine were evaluated.\nAll\nassays\ncontained\ngenus-specific\nantibodies\ndirected\nagainst the lipopolysaccharide component of C. trachoma-\ntis. The IDEIA product incorporates monoclonal-mono-\nclonal antibody capture technology, whereas the Syva and\nChlamydiazyrne assays use polyclonal antibody capture\nmethods. Assay procedures were done by the protocol for\neach product, which included the use of a blocking assay to\nconfirm Chlamydiazyme-positive specimens. Spectrophoto-\nmetric results were obtained by using equipment supplied for\neach assay (Quantum II for Chlamydiazyme, EL312e Bio\nTek reader for IDEIA, and Microtrak autoreader for Micro-\ntrak EIA). A recently approved 90-min protocol was used for\nIDEIA.\nTABLE 1.

DFA testing of urine sediment\nwas chosen as the study confirmation assay, as described\npreviously (11). A fluorescent-labeled monoclonal antibody\n(Microtrak, lot 8H149-C2D; Syva Co.) directed against a\ndifferent epitope (major outer membrane protein) than those\nused in the assays under investigation was selected. A slide\nwas prepared for each test specimen. In addition, direct\nspecimen testing of the original immunoassay aliquot was\ndone when discrepancies among products arose.\nSlide wells were scamed at a x400 magnification by using\na Nikon Labophot episcopic microscope equipped with a\n460- to 490-nm immunofluorescence excitation filter (Nikon\nInc., Garden City, N.Y.). The presence of elementary bod-\nies was confirmed under oil immersion. Specimen and con-\ntrol slides were coded to prevent potential bias of the results.\nSpecimens containing at least two Chlamydia elementary\nbodies demonstrating both proper morphology and immuno-\nfluorescence intensity were judged to be positive.\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of C. trachomatis among our study popu-\nlation is given in Table 1. An overall prevalence of 7% (24 of\n340) was obtained, with the highest infection rate (8.6%)\nfound among adolescents (ages 13 to 20 years). A similar\nincidence (7.5%) was observed in young adults (ages 21 to 30\nyears) but was reduced in older men. Age data for 20\nsubjects, including one positive study participant, could not\nbe ascertained.\nComparative immunoassay performances are summarized\nin Table 2. Measurements of the sensitivities and specifici-\nties of the Chlamydiazyme, IDEIA, and Microtrak products\nwere found to be 79.1 and 99%, 91.7 and 98%, and 95.8 and\n99%, respectively.\nImmunoassay results were routinely compared with DFA\nfindings and demonstrated a high degree of correlation. On\none occasion, a positive result was recorded by all immu-\nnoassays but failed confirmation by DFA. This specimen\nwas considered positive, and the DFA finding was thought to\nbe attributable to a possible sampling error.\nIn situations in which discrepancies in results among\nproducts arose, portions of the original immunoassay aliquot\nwere also prepared and analyzed by DFA. This examination\nproved valuable, because the original immunoassay aliquot\nmaterial from seven of eight patients with reportedly nega-\ntive immunoassay results demonstrated elementary bodies\navailable for antigen detection.

Aliquots from false-positive specimens\nwere never demonstrated to have elementary bodies by\nDFA. The process of aliquot boiling used by two products\n(IDEIA, Microtrak EIA) did not appreciably alter elemen-\ntary body morphology or fluorescence.\nThe IDEIA and Microtrak assays demonstrated perfor-\nmances equal to or better than those claimed by the litera-\nture for the respective products. The sensitivity of Chlamy-\ndiazyme was below product claims for symptomatic males,\nwith 5 false-negative results occurring among 24 confirmed\npositive specimens. In those cases, spectrophotometric ab-\nsorbances were higher than those found for true-negative\nspecimens, but they failed to reach positive cutoff values.\nDISCUSSION\nA Chlamydia screening program must use a diagnostic\napproach which is simple to perform, highly accurate, inex-\npensive, and noninvasive (15). In this study we examined the\nability of commercially available EIAs to satisfy these crite-\nria. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Micro-\ntrak EIA and IDEIA in detecting C. trachomatis in urine\nspecimens from asymptomatic males.\nThe IDEIA product has previously demonstrated sensitiv-\nities and specificities of 100 and 100%, and 81.6 and 100% in\nstudies involving 62 and 224 symptomatic men, respectively\n(4, 11). A similar investigation involving 348 symptomatic\nmen reported sensitivities and specificities of 87 and 97%, 76\nand 97%, and 71 and 98% for the Microtrak EIA, IDEIA,\nand Chlamydiazyme products, respectively (7). The result-\ning assay performance rank for symptomatic men was iden-\ntical to that found in this study of asymptomatic individuals.\nEvaluation of the Chlamydiazyme product resulted in a\n79.1% sensitivity. This value is situated between numerous\nreported sensitivities ranging from 42 to 88% when male\nurine specimens are used (1, 4, 7, 11, 14-16). The poor\nsensitivity obtained for the Chlamydiazyme product (42%) in\none study led investigators to suggest that urine immunoas-\nsay methods may be unsuitable for screening asymptomatic\nindividuals (14). One explanation for this significant reduc-\ntion in sensitivity may result from the methodology used to\nobtain study material. The collection of two urethral swabs\nprior to urine donation may have erroneously biased the\navailable detection material (elementary bodies and antigen)\nin favor of the culture isolation method. Although a reduced\nsensitivity of the Chlamydiazyme assay compared with\nthose of the Microtrak and IDEIA assays was also found in\nthe current investigation, the performances of the Microtrak\nand IDEIA assays suggest their potential for use as screen-\ning tools.\nA basic difficulty encountered in comparative product\ninvestigations is the potential for specimen collection bias,\nwhich may obscure the accuracy of study results (11). The\nuse of urine eliminated errors associated with multiple\nand/or improper sampling and essentially presented each test\nproduct with an equal amount of detectable antigen. This\nspecimen source also allowed a clear determination of how\neach assay would perform under noninvasive screening\nconditions.\nUnder these conditions, we found a 7% C. trachomatis\ncarriage rate among asymptomatic individuals in our study\npopulation. This infection rate is lower than that described\npreviously (2, 3, 5, 18); however, in the present investiga-\ntion, we did not place any age restrictions on study partici-\npants. The observed infection rate in young adults (ages 21\nto 30 years) was relatively equal to that in adolescents (ages\n13 to 20 years). Although the target screening groups for C.\ntrachomatis have traditionally been adolescents, the findings\npresented above suggest that young adults should also be\nincluded.\nIn summary, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe Microtrak ETA and IDEIA immunoassay products for\nthe accurate detection of C. trachomatis in asymptomatic\nmen and suggest their possible role as screening tools. The\nuse of this noninvasive specimen source could result in\ngreater testing compliance in Chlamydia screening and could\nreduce this pathogen's spread in adolescents and young\nadults.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge Amy Tan, Lois Profundi, and Lyn\nBemer for efforts in obtaining and handling study specimens.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Assay results were compared with direct specimen immunofluorescence (DFA) analysis of\nurine sediment (Syva Microtrak; Syva Co.), which was chosen as the study confirmation assay. An overall\nChlamydia prevalence of 7% (24 of 340) was found in our study population, with peak incidences occurring in\nthe adolescent (8 of 93 specimens) and young adult (11 of 146 specimens) age groups.

The process of aliquot boiling used by two products\n(IDEIA, Microtrak EIA) did not appreciably alter elemen-\ntary body morphology or fluorescence.\nThe IDEIA and Microtrak assays demonstrated perfor-\nmances equal to or better than those claimed by the litera-\nture for the respective products. The sensitivity of Chlamy-\ndiazyme was below product claims for symptomatic males,\nwith 5 false-negative results occurring among 24 confirmed\npositive specimens. In those cases, spectrophotometric ab-\nsorbances were higher than those found for true-negative\nspecimens, but they failed to reach positive cutoff values.\nDISCUSSION\nA Chlamydia screening program must use a diagnostic\napproach which is simple to perform, highly accurate, inex-\npensive, and noninvasive (15). In this study we examined the\nability of commercially available EIAs to satisfy these crite-\nria. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Micro-\ntrak EIA and IDEIA in detecting C. trachomatis in urine\nspecimens from asymptomatic males.\nThe IDEIA product has previously demonstrated sensitiv-\nities and specificities of 100 and 100%, and 81.6 and 100% in\nstudies involving 62 and 224 symptomatic men, respectively\n(4, 11). A similar investigation involving 348 symptomatic\nmen reported sensitivities and specificities of 87 and 97%, 76\nand 97%, and 71 and 98% for the Microtrak EIA, IDEIA,\nand Chlamydiazyme products, respectively (7). The result-\ning assay performance rank for symptomatic men was iden-\ntical to that found in this study of asymptomatic individuals.\nEvaluation of the Chlamydiazyme product resulted in a\n79.1% sensitivity. This value is situated between numerous\nreported sensitivities ranging from 42 to 88% when male\nurine specimens are used (1, 4, 7, 11, 14-16). The poor\nsensitivity obtained for the Chlamydiazyme product (42%) in\none study led investigators to suggest that urine immunoas-\nsay methods may be unsuitable for screening asymptomatic\nindividuals (14). One explanation for this significant reduc-\ntion in sensitivity may result from the methodology used to\nobtain study material. The collection of two urethral swabs\nprior to urine donation may have erroneously biased the\navailable detection material (elementary bodies and antigen)\nin favor of the culture isolation method. Although a reduced\nsensitivity of the Chlamydiazyme assay compared with\nthose of the Microtrak and IDEIA assays was also found in\nthe current investigation, the performances of the Microtrak\nand IDEIA assays suggest their potential for use as screen-\ning tools.\nA basic difficulty encountered in comparative product\ninvestigations is the potential for specimen collection bias,\nwhich may obscure the accuracy of study results (11). The\nuse of urine eliminated errors associated with multiple\nand/or improper sampling and essentially presented each test\nproduct with an equal amount of detectable antigen. This\nspecimen source also allowed a clear determination of how\neach assay would perform under noninvasive screening\nconditions.\nUnder these conditions, we found a 7% C. trachomatis\ncarriage rate among asymptomatic individuals in our study\npopulation. This infection rate is lower than that described\npreviously (2, 3, 5, 18); however, in the present investiga-\ntion, we did not place any age restrictions on study partici-\npants. The observed infection rate in young adults (ages 21\nto 30 years) was relatively equal to that in adolescents (ages\n13 to 20 years). Although the target screening groups for C.\ntrachomatis have traditionally been adolescents, the findings\npresented above suggest that young adults should also be\nincluded.\nIn summary, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe Microtrak ETA and IDEIA immunoassay products for\nthe accurate detection of C. trachomatis in asymptomatic\nmen and suggest their possible role as screening tools. The\nuse of this noninvasive specimen source could result in\ngreater testing compliance in Chlamydia screening and could\nreduce this pathogen's spread in adolescents and young\nadults.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge Amy Tan, Lois Profundi, and Lyn\nBenner for efforts in obtaining and handling study specimens.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Palo Alto, Calif.]) were evaluated for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis in urine specimens from\nasymptomatic males. Assay results were compared with direct specimen immunofluorescence (DFA) analysis of\nurine sediment (Syva Microtrak; Syva Co.), which was chosen as the study confirmation assay. An overall\nChlamydia prevalence of 7% (24 of 340) was found in our study population, with peak incidences occurring in\nthe adolescent (8 of 93 specimens) and young adult (11 of 146 specimens) age groups. Sensitivity and specificity\ndata among the Chlamydiazyme, 1DEIA, and Microtrak enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) were determined to be\n79.1 and 99%o, 91.7 and 98%, and 95.8 and 99%o, respectively. The Microtrak EIA and 1DEIA products\ndemonstrated sensitivities and specificities equal to or greater than those claimed for urine specimens. The\ndiagnostic accuracies of these assays on asymptomatic subjects, along with the ease of this collection method,\nsuggest a role for these products as screening tools. The sensitivity of the Chlamydiazyme assay was lower than\nthat claimed previously in symptomatic patients, with 5 of 24 positive specimens demonstrating false-negative\nresults. 1n those cases, centrifugation of the original immunoassay aliquot material and then DFA examination\nconfirmed specimen positivity. Urine immunoassay screening in combination with DFA confirmation (which\nwas chosen because it has antibody epitopic specificity different from that of the primary assay) provides a high\ndegree of diagnostic precision. The use of noninvasive collection methods could result in greater testing\ncompliance among asymptomatic males and, subsequently, could reduce the incidences of both symptomatic\nand silent chlamydial infections.\nChlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular patho-\ngen and has been recognized as a major etiologic agent of\nsexually transmitted disease (6). Genital chlamydial infec-\ntions in females have been associated with cervicitis, endo-\nmetritis, salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infer-\ntility (6, 12). 1nfections in males may include nongonococcal\nand postgonococcal urethritis, epididymitis, and prostatitis\n(2, 3). 1n addition to overt clinical symptoms, a silent or\nasymptomatic response can occur (2, 3, 5, 18).\nThe prevalence of C. trachomatis is highest among sexu-\nally active adolescents, with an asymptomatic carriage rate\nranging between 6 and 15%\n(2, 3, 5, 10, 17,\n18). The\nsignificant health problems and staggering health care costs\nassociated with this large asymptomatic reservoir of infec-\ntion have resulted in calls for the institution of diagnostic\nscreening programs (2, 13). Compliance with testing among\nasymptomatic males has been problematic, in part because\nof the traumatic, invasive nature of the techniques used for\nspecimen collection (2, 10, 18).\nNoninvasive techniques, including those that demonstrate\nthe presence of pyuria, by cytometric and microscopic\nmethods have generally produced unfavorable or incomplete\nresults when compared with urethral swab cultures (2, 3).\nMeasurement of urinary leukocyte esterase, while having\nbeen shown to be procedurally simple and cost-effective, has\n* Corresponding author.\na reported sensitivity that ranges from 72 to 100% (10, 14, 17,\n18). Although these methods offer noninvasive approaches\nto specimen collection, failure to specify etiologic causation\nlimits their value in diagnostic evaluation.\nDirect specimen immunofluorescence (DFA)-monoclonal\nantibody examination of urine sediment provides a highly\naccurate, noninvasive Chlamydia identification method (8,\n9, 15). The morphologic detection of noninfectious elemen-\ntary bodies by DFA offers advantages over culture isolation\nmethods, which require organismic viability (8, 9). Unfortu-\nnately, the labor intensity and technical skills required for\nDFA limit its value as a routine screening tool.\nThe detection of C. trachomatis in male urine specimens\nby enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) has recently become pos-\nsible (4, 11, 16). These assays are rapid, cost-effective, and\nrelatively non-labor-intensive tools which specify chlamyd-\nial infections. Comparison of these methods with culture\nisolation has demonstrated similar detection frequencies in\nmales; however, a great reduction in the sensitivities of the\nEIAs occurs in female urine specimens (1, 11). The perfor-\nmance findings between the sexes is not surprising, because\nanatomical differences can additionally allow for cervical\nand endocervical chlamydial involvement. 1nfection at those\nsites, potentially without any urethral involvement, has\nprecluded urine testing in females.\nPrevious investigations that compared enzymatic urine\nanalysis with urethral culture isolation have demonstrated\nsignificant variations in the performance of individual assay\n2793\n\n2794\nLEONARDI ET AL.\nproducts (4, 11, 16). Those early studies must be carefully\nevaluated because the establishment or modification of man-\nufacturers' procedures (including the use of confirmation\nassays) may have occurred subsequent to their publication.\nThe purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the\nproduct performance of three commercially available immu-\nnoassays for the detection of C. trachomatis by using urine\nspecimens from asymptomatic males. EIA sensitivity and\nspecificity with respect to this group and specimen type were\nincomplete, despite recommendations of health profession-\nals for the institution of screening regimens designed with\nthe use of noninvasive methods.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy population. A total of 340 asymptomatic male vol-\nunteers was recruited from patient clinics (Adolescent Med-\nicine, Employee's Health, 1nfectious Diseases) at the Nas-\nsau\nCounty\nMedical\nCenter\nand\nthe\nNassau\nCounty\nDepartment of Health facilities. Following an interview with\na physician, an informed consent containing both age data\nand a result notification option (if so desired) was signed\nprior to enrollment.\nPotential donors were excluded if they gave no prior\nhistory of sexual intercourse, if they had received antimicro-\nbial therapy in the previous month, or if symptoms consis-\ntent with urethritis were present. Approval of the study was\ngranted by the Medical Center institutional Grants and\nResearch Committee.\nSpecimen collection and handling. A urine specimen (50 to\n60 ml) was collected in a sterile container, refrigerated, and\nprocessed within 48 h. Participants had not urinated for at\nleast 1 h prior to urine donation.\nBulk urine specimens were vigorously vortexed for at\nleast 30 s prior to being divided into aliquots (15 ml) among\nthree centrifuge tubes. The remaining urine specimen (at\nleast 5 ml) was placed in a fourth tube for testing by DFA.\nSpecimens containing less than a 50-ml volume were ex-\ncluded from testing.\nFollowing aliquot centrifugation (3,000 x g for 30 min),\nthe supernatants were removed and the appropriate assay\nspecimen dilution buffer was added to each tube. Sediment\nfrom the DFA tube was washed in phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS), recentrifuged as described above, and resuspended in\na 0.2- to 0.5-ml volume of PBS (11). A drop of this suspen-\nsion was placed onto a Teflon-coated slide (Carlson Scien-\ntific, Peotine, 1ll.), air dried, and fixed in methanol for 5 min.\nEIA procedures. Three commercially available immunoas-\nsays (Chlamydiazyme/Antibody Blocking Assay; lot 51022\nM100 [Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, 1ll.]; 1DEIA; lot\n115101 [Analytab Products, Plainview, N.Y.]; and Microtrak\nEIA; lot 8H619-D29 [Syva Co., Palo Alto, Calif.]) approved\nfor testing for C. trachomatis in male urine were evaluated.\nAll\nassays\ncontained\ngenus-specific\nantibodies\ndirected\nagainst the lipopolysaccharide component of C. trachoma-\ntis.

The sensitivity of Chlamy-\ndiazyme was below product claims for symptomatic males,\nwith 5 false-negative results occurring among 24 confirmed\npositive specimens. 1n those cases, spectrophotometric ab-\nsorbances were higher than those found for true-negative\nspecimens, but they failed to reach positive cutoff values.\nDISCUSSION\nA Chlamydia screening program must use a diagnostic\napproach which is simple to perform, highly accurate, inex-\npensive, and noninvasive (15). 1n this study we examined the\nability of commercially available EIAs to satisfy these crite-\nria. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Micro-\ntrak EIA and 1DEIA in detecting C. trachomatis in urine\nspecimens from asymptomatic males.\nThe 1DEIA product has previously demonstrated sensitiv-\nities and specificities of 100 and 100%, and 81.6 and 100% in\nstudies involving 62 and 224 symptomatic men, respectively\n(4, 11). A similar investigation involving 348 symptomatic\nmen reported sensitivities and specificities of 87 and 97%, 76\nand 97%, and 71 and 98% for the Microtrak EIA, 1DEIA,\nand Chlamydiazyme products, respectively (7). The result-\ning assay performance rank for symptomatic men was iden-\ntical to that found in this study of asymptomatic individuals.\nEvaluation of the Chlamydiazyme product resulted in a\n79.1% sensitivity. This value is situated between numerous\nreported sensitivities ranging from 42 to 88% when male\nurine specimens are used (1, 4, 7, 11, 14-16). The poor\nsensitivity obtained for the Chlamydiazyme product (42%) in\none study led investigators to suggest that urine immunoas-\nsay methods may be unsuitable for screening asymptomatic\nindividuals (14). One explanation for this significant reduc-\ntion in sensitivity may result from the methodology used to\nobtain study material. The collection of two urethral swabs\nprior to urine donation may have erroneously biased the\navailable detection material (elementary bodies and antigen)\nin favor of the culture isolation method. Although a reduced\nsensitivity of the Chlamydiazyme assay compared with\nthose of the Microtrak and 1DEIA assays was also found in\nthe current investigation, the performances of the Microtrak\nand 1DEIA assays suggest their potential for use as screen-\ning tools.\nA basic difficulty encountered in comparative product\ninvestigations is the potential for specimen collection bias,\nwhich may obscure the accuracy of study results (11). The\nuse of urine eliminated errors associated with multiple\nand/or improper sampling and essentially presented each test\nproduct with an equal amount of detectable antigen. This\nspecimen source also allowed a clear determination of how\neach assay would perform under noninvasive screening\nconditions.\nUnder these conditions, we found a 7% C. trachomatis\ncarriage rate among asymptomatic individuals in our study\npopulation. This infection rate is lower than that described\npreviously (2, 3, 5, 18); however, in the present investiga-\ntion, we did not place any age restrictions on study partici-\npants. The observed infection rate in young adults (ages 21\nto 30 years) was relatively equal to that in adolescents (ages\n13 to 20 years). Although the target screening groups for C.\ntrachomatis have traditionally been adolescents, the findings\npresented above suggest that young adults should also be\nincluded. 1n summary, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe Microtrak ETA and 1DEIA immunoassay products for\nthe accurate detection of C. trachomatis in asymptomatic\nmen and suggest their possible role as screening tools. The\nuse of this noninvasive specimen source could result in\ngreater testing compliance in Chlamydia screening and could\nreduce this pathogen's spread in adolescents and young\nadults.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge Amy Tan, Lois Profundi, and Lyn\nBemer for efforts in obtaining and handling study specimens.\nREFERENCES\n1.

WINN1\nDepartment of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine1 and 1nfectious Diseases Unit, Department of Medicine,2 Fletcher\nAllen Health Care and the University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont\nReceived 12 February 1996/Returned for modi\ufb01cation 16 March 1996/Accepted 27 March 1996\nDocumented Paecilomyces lilacinus infections are quite rare. Most reports involve immunocompromised\npatients or implanted objects. We report the \ufb01rst case of complicated soft tissue infection caused by P. lilacinus\nin an immunocompetent host. The spectrum of infections involving this fungus is reviewed.\nPaecilomyces species are widely distributed throughout the\nenvironment. They are frequently detected in soil samples (3,\n5, 9, 16), decomposing vegetation (29), and as airborne con-\ntaminants (22).\nDespite its ubiquity, Paecilomyces lilacinus remains an un-\ncommon cause of fungal infections in humans. The majority of\ncase reports describe ocular infections (1, 6, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18,\n19, 27). Others have implicated Paecilomyces lilacinus as a\ncause of dermatologic infection (2, 8, 15, 28), sinusitis (23, 24),\npulmonary mycosis (4), an abdominal wall abscess (26), and\nfungemia related to an indwelling catheter (29). We describe\nthe \ufb01rst reported case of deep soft tissue infection with bursitis\ncaused by Paecilomyces lilacinus in an immunocompetent host.\nSurgery and prolonged antifungal therapy were required to\neradicate the infection.\nCase report. A 35-year-old male Caucasian presented to a\ngeneral internist complaining of pain and swelling below his\nright knee for 5 days. The patient was employed as an auto\nmechanic and stated that his pain began after working on his\nknees on a cement \ufb02oor. He did not recall any break in the skin\nor any injury involving a foreign body. A diagnosis of pretibial\neffusion was made, and \ufb02uid was aspirated. A swab culture of\nthe \ufb02uid for aerobic bacteria revealed no growth. The patient\nsaw a second physician shortly thereafter, with the same com-\nplaints. The area was again aspirated and then injected with a\ncorticosteroid. Cultures were not obtained.\nAlthough his symptoms improved brie\ufb02y, pain and swelling\nreturned 2 months later, at which time the patient was evalu-\nated by an orthopedic surgeon. A radiograph of the knee was\nnormal, and a clinical diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis was\nmade. One week later, he was examined by a rheumatologist,\nwho aspirated a \ufb02uctuant pretibial lesion. Four milliliters of\npurulent material contained 183,000 polymorphonuclear leu-\nkocytes per mm3, 30,000 erythrocytes per mm3, and a glucose\nlevel of 4 mg/dl. Gram\u2019s stain revealed many polymorphonu-\nclear leukocytes but no organisms. Treatment with oral cefa-\nclor was initiated. Cultures for aerobic bacteria and mycobac-\nteria were subsequently negative, but a mould was isolated\nfrom the aspirated pus. The patient\u2019s signs and symptoms did\nnot improve with the antibiotic, and he developed a tempera-\nture of 101 to 1028F (;38.5 to 38.78C). Five days later his\nantibiotic treatment was empirically changed to oral dicloxacil-\nlin.\nAfter another week of antibacterial therapy, radiographs of\nthe right knee, tibia, and \ufb01bula were interpreted as normal. At\nthat time, another aspiration of the site was performed, yield-\ning 1.5 ml of \ufb02uid containing 2,600 leukocytes per mm3, 97% of\nwhich were polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and 21,300 eryth-\nrocytes per mm3. Bacterial and mycobacterial cultures were\nnegative, but fungal cultures of the aspirate again grew a\nmould morphologically identical to the \ufb01rst isolate.\nThe patient was then referred to an infectious disease spe-\ncialist. He appeared well and in no acute distress but walked\nwith a tentative gait that was limited by pain in his right leg. He\nwas afebrile. The right lower extremity contained a horseshoe-\nshaped area of warmth, erythema, induration, and tenderness\nanteriorly just below the knee. The knee joint itself exhibited\nfull range of motion without effusion. There were no ulcer-\nations or evidence of lymphangitis. An erythrocyte sedimenta-\ntion rate was 7 mm/h. Antibodies to human immunode\ufb01ciency\nvirus were not detected.\nA magnetic resonance imaging scan, performed 2 weeks\nafter the second aspiration, revealed extensive super\ufb01cial and\ndeep soft tissue involvement. The patient elected to pursue a\ncourse of leg immobilization and oral \ufb02uconazole (200 mg per\nos daily) rather than immediate surgery.\nThe microbiology laboratory identi\ufb01ed the mould isolate as\na Penicillium/Paecilomyces species, suspicious for Paecilomyces\nlilacinus. The identi\ufb01cation of Paecilomyces lilacinus was sub-\nsequently con\ufb01rmed (Fungus Testing Laboratory, San Anto-\nnio, Tex.).\nDespite continued oral antifungal therapy, a dull ache and\nswelling persisted in the leg, and plans were made for debride-\nment. He was admitted to the hospital 4 months after he was\n\ufb01rst evaluated by a physician and placed on intravenous mi-\nconazole because in vitro susceptibility testing indicated that\nthe isolate was resistant to \ufb02uconazole. Three days later the\nright anterior tibial soft tissue was debrided. Multiple frag-\nments of soft, pink tissue, measuring approximately 2.0 to 5.0\nby 1.0 to 2.0 by 0.5 to 1.5 cm, were excised. No gross evidence\nof extension to bone was noted; therefore, the surgeon elected\nnot to perform a bone biopsy. Microscopically, the connective\ntissue was replaced by con\ufb02uent caseating granulomas. Pali-\nsading of epithelioid macrophages was prominent, and multi-\nnucleated giant cells were present.

Acid-fast stains were negative.\nThe patient developed severe phlebitis from miconazole,\nand therapy was changed to oral ketoconazole (400 mg daily).\nHe was discharged 1 week after admission.\nAt follow-up approximately 3 weeks after surgery his wound\nwas healing very well. He denied any fever or chills but did\nreport an occasional achiness in the leg. The patient\u2019s overall\nsigns and symptoms were greatly improved, and he was begin-\nning physical therapy while continuing to take ketoconazole.\nPlain \ufb01lms of the knee and upper tibia, obtained approximately\n1 month after discharge, were normal.\nA repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan performed ap-\nproximately 8 months after initial presentation was normal\nwithout evidence of osteomyelitis. One week before that scan\nthe patient had stopped taking ketoconazole. Although he\nexperienced some chronic leg pain distal to his incision, he\ncontinued physical therapy and eventually returned to work. A\nfollow-up visit approximately 1 year postsurgery found him to\nbe pain free with no further complications.\nMicrobiological \ufb01ndings. Paecilomyces lilacinus was isolated\non two occasions from aspirates of the right infrapatellar bursa\nobtained 12 days apart. The fungus produced white, \ufb02occose\ncolonies within 3 days on Sabouraud dextrose agar with and\nwithout cycloheximide and chloramphenicol. After 4 days as\nconidia began to form, the mycelium developed a lilac-rose-red\ncolor, which became deeper as the colonies aged. Pigment\nproduction was enhanced by placing the fungus on potato\n\ufb02akes agar (21) and Czapek agar (29). The reverse side of the\ncolony was nonpigmented. The isolate was somewhat adherent\nto the agar.\nMicroscopic examination revealed branched phialides orga-\nnized as a \u2018\u2018penicillus,\u2019\u2019 initially suggesting a Penicillium spe-\ncies. On further examination with calco\ufb02uor white, numerous\nphialides that possessed long, constricted or tapered necks,\nsuggestive of Paecilomyces species, were observed. Primarily\noval conidia appeared in elongated chains. Conidia consis-\ntently measured 3.0 by 2.0 mm (Fig. 2). On the basis of these\nmicroscopic characteristics and the lilac pigment, Paecilomyces\nlilacinus was identi\ufb01ed.\nSusceptibility testing was performed (Fungus Testing Labo-\nratory) by the macro broth dilution method. The isolate was\nresistant to \ufb02uconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B\n(MICs of .64, .8, and .16 mg/ml, respectively), and suscep-\ntible to ketoconazole and miconazole (MICs of 1 and 0.5\nmg/ml, respectively).\nDiscussion.

Morphologi-\ncally, the fungus closely resembles members of the genus Pen-\nicillium, and disagreement continues to exist among experts as\nto the correct taxonomic designation (29). The diagnostic dif-\n\ufb01culty is re\ufb02ected in numerous case reports that describe an\ninitial laboratory identi\ufb01cation of Penicillium species before a\n\ufb01nal report of Paecilomyces lilacinus was issued (15, 19, 26, 27,\n29).\nDespite being prevalent in the environment, documented\nfungal infection by Paecilomyces lilacinus occurs very rarely.\nThis case represents the \ufb01rst report of complex soft tissue\ninfection with bursitis caused by this fungus in an immunocom-\npetent host. Several recently published reports (26, 29) and the\ncase we describe, suggest that Paecilomyces lilacinus may be\nemerging as an important pathogen.\nThe bulk of reported Paecilomyces lilacinus infections in-\nvolve the eye. Endophthalmitis has been described by several\ninvestigators (10, 13, 16, 18, 19). Twelve patients became in-\nfected when contaminated intraocular lenses (13, 18, 19) were\nunknowingly implanted. This outbreak illustrates the potential\nof this fungus to cause severe morbidity, as the majority of eyes\ninvolved were not salvageable, and its ability to survive com-\nmercial sterilization methods. Paecilomyces lilacinus has also\ncaused several episodes of keratitis (14, 27), an infected cor-\nneal transplant (6), and an orbital granuloma (1). Vision was\nimproved in the patients with keratitis after prompt medical\nintervention. A combination of aggressive antifungal therapy\nand a second transplant led to the resolution of the infection in\nthe patient reported by Gordon and Norton (6). Agrawal et al.\nreported resolution of the orbital infection with excentration,\nbut dissemination to neighboring tissue occurred despite sur-\ngery and amphotericin B therapy (1).\nDermatologic infection with Paecilomyces lilacinus consti-\ntutes the next largest group of published reports. Jade et al.\ndescribed a case of a deep cellulitis in an immunocompromised\npatient in which a favorable outcome was achieved only after\ncombination therapy with amphotericin B and \ufb02ucytosine (8).\nCastro et al. reported an infection caused by Paecilomyces\nlilacinus that was localized to the left forearm in a renal trans-\nplant patient. Their patient was cured with oral griseofulvin\n(500 mg/day) (2). Murciano et al. reported a cutaneous infec-\ntion with Paecilomyces lilacinus in a young girl with leukemia\n(15). This patient\u2019s course was complicated by persistent neu-\ntropenia, and she subsequently died. 1t was not clear whether\ndissemination had occurred because an autopsy was refused.\nTakayasu et al. described a case of cutaneous mycosis caused\nby Paecilomyces lilacinus in an immunocompetent host (28).\nThe fungus was repeatedly isolated from biopsy specimens\ntaken from lesions on the patient\u2019s left cheek, and hyphal\nelements were observed in tissue sections. The lesions were\ngreatly reduced in number with oral griseofulvin.\nAdditional accounts of Paecilomyces lilacinus infection in-\nclude two reports of chronic maxillary sinusitis (23, 24), both\ncured with surgical debridement, and a report of pulmonary\nmycosis (4) which required amphotericin B therapy. All three\ninfections occurred in immunocompetent hosts. Tan et al. de-\nscribed a recent case of catheter related fungemia in an im-\nmunocompromised pediatric patient (29). Removal of the\ncatheter and treatment with amphotericin B resulted in a cure.\nAnother recent report, by Silliman et al., implicates Paecilo-\nmyces lilacinus as the etiologic agent of two abdominal wall\nabscesses in a child with chronic granulomatous disease (26).\nAlthough the infection appeared to respond well to amphoter-\nicin B therapy, the child died 4 months later of an unrelated\ninfection. Paecilomyces lilacinus has also been reported as a\npathogen in animals (5) and insects (29).\nPaecilomyces species other than Paecilomyces lilacinus also\ncause occasional infection (9, 22). The majority of these in-\nvolve Paecilomyces variotii. Henig et al. described a case of\nPaecilomyces infection of the lacrimal sac, in which the species\nidenti\ufb01cation was not determined (7).\nGiven the ubiquity of Paecilomyces lilacinus in the environ-\nment (3, 9, 20, 22, 29), it is likely that the patient described in\nthis report acquired his infection through minor trauma to his\nknees while working as an auto mechanic. Although he did not\nremember any puncture wounds or breaks in his skin, he had\nspent considerable time on his knees before development of\nsymptoms. 1t is interesting to note that the patient\u2019s knee had been\nmanipulated twice, including injection with a corticosteroid,\nbefore Paecilomyces lilacinus was isolated. Although introduc-\ntion of the fungus during aspiration or injection seems unlikely\nin this case, that possibility cannot be eliminated.\nNumerous strains of Paecilomyces lilacinus are capable of\nproducing potent mycotoxins (11, 12). Leucinostatins derived\nfrom cultures of the organism are highly toxic to experimental\nanimals and appear to have had a direct impact on the tissue\nin\ufb02ammatory response. 1noculation of leucinostatin directly\ninto the cornea of a rabbit resulted in abscess formation. These\n\ufb01ndings suggest that toxin production by Paecilomyces lilacinus\nmay be an important virulence factor (11, 12).\nThe therapy of invasive fungal infections usually includes the\nremoval of any foreign bodies or medical devices, debridement\nor excision of infected tissue, and/or treatment with antifungal\nchemotherapeutic agents. Susceptibility testing of moulds has\nnot yet been completely standardized or validated. A standard\nmacrotube MIC test has been proposed by the National Com-\nmittee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (17) and was used by\nthe reference laboratory for this isolate. For infrequent patho-\ngens, such as Paecilomyces lilacinus, construction of reliable\ninterpretative criteria for susceptibility tests is particularly dif-\n\ufb01cult. 1n general, Paecilomyces variotii is susceptible in vitro to\ncommon antifungal chemotherapeutic agents, whereas Paecilo-\nmyces lilacinus is resistant to amphotericin B and \ufb02ucytosine\nbut susceptible to imidazole compounds. Despite in vitro sus-\nceptibility data, several reports already mentioned describe a\npositive outcome when amphotericin B was administered. Ex-\nplanations for this discrepancy may include strain differences\nof Paecilomyces lilacinus, responses to surgical or local mea-\nsures independent of amphotericin therapy, or that criteria for\nde\ufb01ning interpretation breakpoints need further re\ufb01nement.\nOral griseofulvin was also used successfully in two patients\ndescribed previously (2, 28). 1n our case, cure was achieved with a combination of surgical\nexcision of infected tissue and prolonged administration of\nimidazole compounds to which the isolate was susceptible in\nvitro. Treatment with \ufb02uconazole alone (to which the isolate\nwas ultimately determined resistant in vitro) did not effect a\nclinical cure, although the mould could not be recovered from\ninfected tissue at the time of surgery.\nAlthough infection is uncommon, it is important for clini-\ncians and microbiologists to consider the potential pathogenic-\nity of any isolate of Paecilomyces lilacinus within the context of\nthe clinical factors. 1t is likely that this fungus will continue to\nbe implicated as a cause of invasive infection. Multiple isolates\nof a fungus from the same specimen and/or patient increases\nthe likelihood that the isolate is clinically signi\ufb01cant. Demon-\nstrating morphologically compatible fungi in tissue sections\nauthenticates the diagnosis.\nVOL. 34, 1996\nNOTES\n1561\n\nWe thank Wendy Haupt, Heidi Higgins-Cutler, Michele Kohn, and\nNikki Sawyer for technical assistance and Pat Woelly for secretarial\nassistance.\nREFERENCES\n1.

WINN1\nDepartment of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine1 and Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Medicine,2 Fletcher\nAllen Health Care and the University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont\nReceived 12 February 1996/Returned for modi\ufb01cation 16 March 1996/Accepted 27 March 1996\nDocumented Paecilomyces lilacinus infections are quite rare. Most reports involve immunocompromised\npatients or implanted objects. We report the \ufb01rst case of complicated soft tissue infection caused by P. lilacinus\nin an immunocompetent host. The spectrum of infections involving this fungus is reviewed.\nPaecilomyces species are widely distributed throughout the\nenvironment. They are frequently detected in soil samples (3,\n5, 9, 16), decomposing vegetation (29), and as airborne con-\ntaminants (22).\nDespite its ubiquity, Paecilomyces lilacinus remains an un-\ncommon cause of fungal infections in humans. The majority of\ncase reports describe ocular infections (1, 6, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18,\n19, 27). Others have implicated Paecilomyces lilacinus as a\ncause of dermatologic infection (2, 8, 15, 28), sinusitis (23, 24),\npulmonary mycosis (4), an abdominal wall abscess (26), and\nfungemia related to an indwelling catheter (29). We describe\nthe \ufb01rst reported case of deep soft tissue infection with bursitis\ncaused by Paecilomyces lilacinus in an immunocompetent host.\nSurgery and prolonged antifungal therapy were required to\neradicate the infection.\nCase report. A 35-year-old male Caucasian presented to a\ngeneral internist complaining of pain and swelling below his\nright knee for 5 days. The patient was employed as an auto\nmechanic and stated that his pain began after working on his\nknees on a cement \ufb02oor. He did not recall any break in the skin\nor any injury involving a foreign body. A diagnosis of pretibial\neffusion was made, and \ufb02uid was aspirated. A swab culture of\nthe \ufb02uid for aerobic bacteria revealed no growth. The patient\nsaw a second physician shortly thereafter, with the same com-\nplaints. The area was again aspirated and then injected with a\ncorticosteroid. Cultures were not obtained.\nAlthough his symptoms improved brie\ufb02y, pain and swelling\nreturned 2 months later, at which time the patient was evalu-\nated by an orthopedic surgeon. A radiograph of the knee was\nnormal, and a clinical diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis was\nmade. One week later, he was examined by a rheumatologist,\nwho aspirated a \ufb02uctuant pretibial lesion. Four milliliters of\npurulent material contained 183,000 polymorphonuclear leu-\nkocytes per mm3, 30,000 erythrocytes per mm3, and a glucose\nlevel of 4 mg/dl. Gram\u2019s stain revealed many polymorphonu-\nclear leukocytes but no organisms. Treatment with oral cefa-\nclor was initiated. Cultures for aerobic bacteria and mycobac-\nteria were subsequently negative, but a mould was isolated\nfrom the aspirated pus. The patient\u2019s signs and symptoms did\nnot improve with the antibiotic, and he developed a tempera-\nture of 101 to 1028F (;38.5 to 38.78C). Five days later his\nantibiotic treatment was empirically changed to oral dicloxacil-\nlin.\nAfter another week of antibacterial therapy, radiographs of\nthe right knee, tibia, and \ufb01bula were interpreted as normal. At\nthat time, another aspiration of the site was performed, yield-\ning 1.5 ml of \ufb02uid containing 2,600 leukocytes per mm3, 97% of\nwhich were polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and 21,300 eryth-\nrocytes per mm3. Bacterial and mycobacterial cultures were\nnegative, but fungal cultures of the aspirate again grew a\nmould morphologically identical to the \ufb01rst isolate.\nThe patient was then referred to an infectious disease spe-\ncialist. He appeared well and in no acute distress but walked\nwith a tentative gait that was limited by pain in his right leg. He\nwas afebrile. The right lower extremity contained a horseshoe-\nshaped area of warmth, erythema, induration, and tenderness\nanteriorly just below the knee. The knee joint itself exhibited\nfull range of motion without effusion. There were no ulcer-\nations or evidence of lymphangitis. An erythrocyte sedimenta-\ntion rate was 7 mm/h. Antibodies to human immunode\ufb01ciency\nvirus were not detected.\nA magnetic resonance imaging scan, performed 2 weeks\nafter the second aspiration, revealed extensive super\ufb01cial and\ndeep soft tissue involvement. The patient elected to pursue a\ncourse of leg immobilization and oral \ufb02uconazole (200 mg per\nos daily) rather than immediate surgery.\nThe microbiology laboratory identi\ufb01ed the mould isolate as\na Penicillium/Paecilomyces species, suspicious for Paecilomyces\nlilacinus. The identi\ufb01cation of Paecilomyces lilacinus was sub-\nsequently con\ufb01rmed (Fungus Testing Laboratory, San Anto-\nnio, Tex.).\nDespite continued oral antifungal therapy, a dull ache and\nswelling persisted in the leg, and plans were made for debride-\nment. He was admitted to the hospital 4 months after he was\n\ufb01rst evaluated by a physician and placed on intravenous mi-\nconazole because in vitro susceptibility testing indicated that\nthe isolate was resistant to \ufb02uconazole. Three days later the\nright anterior tibial soft tissue was debrided. Multiple frag-\nments of soft, pink tissue, measuring approximately 2.0 to 5.0\nby 1.0 to 2.0 by 0.5 to 1.5 cm, were excised. No gross evidence\nof extension to bone was noted; therefore, the surgeon elected\nnot to perform a bone biopsy. Microscopically, the comective\ntissue was replaced by con\ufb02uent caseating granulomas. Pali-\nsading of epithelioid macrophages was prominent, and multi-\nnucleated giant cells were present.

Acid-fast stains were negative.\nThe patient developed severe phlebitis from miconazole,\nand therapy was changed to oral ketoconazole (400 mg daily).\nHe was discharged 1 week after admission.\nAt follow-up approximately 3 weeks after surgery his wound\nwas healing very well. He denied any fever or chills but did\nreport an occasional achiness in the leg. The patient\u2019s overall\nsigns and symptoms were greatly improved, and he was begin-\nning physical therapy while continuing to take ketoconazole.\nPlain \ufb01lms of the knee and upper tibia, obtained approximately\n1 month after discharge, were normal.\nA repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan performed ap-\nproximately 8 months after initial presentation was normal\nwithout evidence of osteomyelitis. One week before that scan\nthe patient had stopped taking ketoconazole. Although he\nexperienced some chronic leg pain distal to his incision, he\ncontinued physical therapy and eventually returned to work. A\nfollow-up visit approximately 1 year postsurgery found him to\nbe pain free with no further complications.\nMicrobiological \ufb01ndings. Paecilomyces lilacinus was isolated\non two occasions from aspirates of the right infrapatellar bursa\nobtained 12 days apart. The fungus produced white, \ufb02occose\ncolonies within 3 days on Sabouraud dextrose agar with and\nwithout cycloheximide and chloramphenicol. After 4 days as\nconidia began to form, the mycelium developed a lilac-rose-red\ncolor, which became deeper as the colonies aged. Pigment\nproduction was enhanced by placing the fungus on potato\n\ufb02akes agar (21) and Czapek agar (29). The reverse side of the\ncolony was nonpigmented. The isolate was somewhat adherent\nto the agar.\nMicroscopic examination revealed branched phialides orga-\nnized as a \u2018\u2018penicillus,\u2019\u2019 initially suggesting a Penicillium spe-\ncies. On further examination with calco\ufb02uor white, numerous\nphialides that possessed long, constricted or tapered necks,\nsuggestive of Paecilomyces species, were observed. Primarily\noval conidia appeared in elongated chains. Conidia consis-\ntently measured 3.0 by 2.0 mm (Fig. 2). On the basis of these\nmicroscopic characteristics and the lilac pigment, Paecilomyces\nlilacinus was identi\ufb01ed.\nSusceptibility testing was performed (Fungus Testing Labo-\nratory) by the macro broth dilution method. The isolate was\nresistant to \ufb02uconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B\n(MICs of .64, .8, and .16 mg/ml, respectively), and suscep-\ntible to ketoconazole and miconazole (MICs of 1 and 0.5\nmg/ml, respectively).\nDiscussion.

Morphologi-\ncally, the fungus closely resembles members of the genus Pen-\nicillium, and disagreement continues to exist among experts as\nto the correct taxonomic designation (29). The diagnostic dif-\n\ufb01culty is re\ufb02ected in numerous case reports that describe an\ninitial laboratory identi\ufb01cation of Penicillium species before a\n\ufb01nal report of Paecilomyces lilacinus was issued (15, 19, 26, 27,\n29).\nDespite being prevalent in the environment, documented\nfungal infection by Paecilomyces lilacinus occurs very rarely.\nThis case represents the \ufb01rst report of complex soft tissue\ninfection with bursitis caused by this fungus in an immunocom-\npetent host. Several recently published reports (26, 29) and the\ncase we describe, suggest that Paecilomyces lilacinus may be\nemerging as an important pathogen.\nThe bulk of reported Paecilomyces lilacinus infections in-\nvolve the eye. Endophthalmitis has been described by several\ninvestigators (10, 13, 16, 18, 19). Twelve patients became in-\nfected when contaminated intraocular lenses (13, 18, 19) were\nunknowingly implanted. This outbreak illustrates the potential\nof this fungus to cause severe morbidity, as the majority of eyes\ninvolved were not salvageable, and its ability to survive com-\nmercial sterilization methods. Paecilomyces lilacinus has also\ncaused several episodes of keratitis (14, 27), an infected cor-\nneal transplant (6), and an orbital granuloma (1). Vision was\nimproved in the patients with keratitis after prompt medical\nintervention. A combination of aggressive antifungal therapy\nand a second transplant led to the resolution of the infection in\nthe patient reported by Gordon and Norton (6). Agrawal et al.\nreported resolution of the orbital infection with excentration,\nbut dissemination to neighboring tissue occurred despite sur-\ngery and amphotericin B therapy (1).\nDermatologic infection with Paecilomyces lilacinus consti-\ntutes the next largest group of published reports. Jade et al.\ndescribed a case of a deep cellulitis in an immunocompromised\npatient in which a favorable outcome was achieved only after\ncombination therapy with amphotericin B and \ufb02ucytosine (8).\nCastro et al. reported an infection caused by Paecilomyces\nlilacinus that was localized to the left forearm in a renal trans-\nplant patient. Their patient was cured with oral griseofulvin\n(500 mg/day) (2). Murciano et al. reported a cutaneous infec-\ntion with Paecilomyces lilacinus in a young girl with leukemia\n(15). This patient\u2019s course was complicated by persistent neu-\ntropenia, and she subsequently died. It was not clear whether\ndissemination had occurred because an autopsy was refused.\nTakayasu et al. described a case of cutaneous mycosis caused\nby Paecilomyces lilacinus in an immunocompetent host (28).\nThe fungus was repeatedly isolated from biopsy specimens\ntaken from lesions on the patient\u2019s left cheek, and hyphal\nelements were observed in tissue sections. The lesions were\ngreatly reduced in number with oral griseofulvin.\nAdditional accounts of Paecilomyces lilacinus infection in-\nclude two reports of chronic maxillary sinusitis (23, 24), both\ncured with surgical debridement, and a report of pulmonary\nmycosis (4) which required amphotericin B therapy. All three\ninfections occurred in immunocompetent hosts. Tan et al. de-\nscribed a recent case of catheter related fungemia in an im-\nmunocompromised pediatric patient (29). Removal of the\ncatheter and treatment with amphotericin B resulted in a cure.\nAnother recent report, by Silliman et al., implicates Paecilo-\nmyces lilacinus as the etiologic agent of two abdominal wall\nabscesses in a child with chronic granulomatous disease (26).\nAlthough the infection appeared to respond well to amphoter-\nicin B therapy, the child died 4 months later of an unrelated\ninfection. Paecilomyces lilacinus has also been reported as a\npathogen in animals (5) and insects (29).\nPaecilomyces species other than Paecilomyces lilacinus also\ncause occasional infection (9, 22). The majority of these in-\nvolve Paecilomyces variotii. Henig et al. described a case of\nPaecilomyces infection of the lacrimal sac, in which the species\nidenti\ufb01cation was not determined (7).\nGiven the ubiquity of Paecilomyces lilacinus in the environ-\nment (3, 9, 20, 22, 29), it is likely that the patient described in\nthis report acquired his infection through minor trauma to his\nknees while working as an auto mechanic. Although he did not\nremember any puncture wounds or breaks in his skin, he had\nspent considerable time on his knees before development of\nsymptoms.\nIt is interesting to note that the patient\u2019s knee had been\nmanipulated twice, including injection with a corticosteroid,\nbefore Paecilomyces lilacinus was isolated. Although introduc-\ntion of the fungus during aspiration or injection seems unlikely\nin this case, that possibility camot be eliminated.\nNumerous strains of Paecilomyces lilacinus are capable of\nproducing potent mycotoxins (11, 12). Leucinostatins derived\nfrom cultures of the organism are highly toxic to experimental\nanimals and appear to have had a direct impact on the tissue\nin\ufb02ammatory response. Inoculation of leucinostatin directly\ninto the cornea of a rabbit resulted in abscess formation. These\n\ufb01ndings suggest that toxin production by Paecilomyces lilacinus\nmay be an important virulence factor (11, 12).\nThe therapy of invasive fungal infections usually includes the\nremoval of any foreign bodies or medical devices, debridement\nor excision of infected tissue, and/or treatment with antifungal\nchemotherapeutic agents. Susceptibility testing of moulds has\nnot yet been completely standardized or validated. A standard\nmacrotube MIC test has been proposed by the National Com-\nmittee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (17) and was used by\nthe reference laboratory for this isolate. For infrequent patho-\ngens, such as Paecilomyces lilacinus, construction of reliable\ninterpretative criteria for susceptibility tests is particularly dif-\n\ufb01cult.\nIn general, Paecilomyces variotii is susceptible in vitro to\ncommon antifungal chemotherapeutic agents, whereas Paecilo-\nmyces lilacinus is resistant to amphotericin B and \ufb02ucytosine\nbut susceptible to imidazole compounds. Despite in vitro sus-\nceptibility data, several reports already mentioned describe a\npositive outcome when amphotericin B was administered. Ex-\nplanations for this discrepancy may include strain differences\nof Paecilomyces lilacinus, responses to surgical or local mea-\nsures independent of amphotericin therapy, or that criteria for\nde\ufb01ning interpretation breakpoints need further re\ufb01nement.\nOral griseofulvin was also used successfully in two patients\ndescribed previously (2, 28).\nIn our case, cure was achieved with a combination of surgical\nexcision of infected tissue and prolonged administration of\nimidazole compounds to which the isolate was susceptible in\nvitro. Treatment with \ufb02uconazole alone (to which the isolate\nwas ultimately determined resistant in vitro) did not effect a\nclinical cure, although the mould could not be recovered from\ninfected tissue at the time of surgery.\nAlthough infection is uncommon, it is important for clini-\ncians and microbiologists to consider the potential pathogenic-\nity of any isolate of Paecilomyces lilacinus within the context of\nthe clinical factors. It is likely that this fungus will continue to\nbe implicated as a cause of invasive infection. Multiple isolates\nof a fungus from the same specimen and/or patient increases\nthe likelihood that the isolate is clinically signi\ufb01cant. Demon-\nstrating morphologically compatible fungi in tissue sections\nauthenticates the diagnosis.\nVOL. 34, 1996\nNOTES\n1561\n\nWe thank Wendy Haupt, Heidi Higgins-Cutler, Michele Kohn, and\nNikki Sawyer for technical assistance and Pat Woelly for secretarial\nassistance.\nREFERENCES\n1.

WINN1\nDepartment of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine1 and Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Medicine,2 Fletcher\nAllen Health Care and the University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont\nReceived 12 February 1996/Returned for modi\ufb01cation 16 March 1996/Accepted 27 March 1996\nDocumented Paecilomyces lilacinus infections are quite rare. Most reports involve immunocompromised\npatients or implanted objects. We report the \ufb01rst case of complicated soft tissue infection caused by P. lilacinus\nin an immunocompetent host. The spectrum of infections involving this fungus is reviewed.\nPaecilomyces species are widely distributed throughout the\nenvironment. They are frequently detected in soil samples (3,\n5, 9, 16), decomposing vegetation (29), and as airborne con-\ntaminants (22).\nDespite its ubiquity, Paecilomyces lilacinus remains an un-\ncommon cause of fungal infections in humans. The majority of\ncase reports describe ocular infections (1, 6, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18,\n19, 27). Others have implicated Paecilomyces lilacinus as a\ncause of dermatologic infection (2, 8, 15, 28), sinusitis (23, 24),\npulmonary mycosis (4), an abdominal wall abscess (26), and\nfungemia related to an indwelling catheter (29). We describe\nthe \ufb01rst reported case of deep soft tissue infection with bursitis\ncaused by Paecilomyces lilacinus in an immunocompetent host.\nSurgery and prolonged antifungal therapy were required to\neradicate the infection.\nCase report. A 35-year-old male Caucasian presented to a\ngeneral internist complaining of pain and swelling below his\nright knee for 5 days. The patient was employed as an auto\nmechanic and stated that his pain began after working on his\nknees on a cement \ufb02oor. He did not recall any break in the skin\nor any injury involving a foreign body. A diagnosis of pretibial\neffusion was made, and \ufb02uid was aspirated. A swab culture of\nthe \ufb02uid for aerobic bacteria revealed no growth. The patient\nsaw a second physician shortly thereafter, with the same com-\nplaints. The area was again aspirated and then injected with a\ncorticosteroid. Cultures were not obtained.\nAlthough his symptoms improved brie\ufb02y, pain and swelling\nreturned 2 months later, at which time the patient was evalu-\nated by an orthopedic surgeon. A radiograph of the knee was\nnormal, and a clinical diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis was\nmade. One week later, he was examined by a rheumatologist,\nwho aspirated a \ufb02uctuant pretibial lesion. Four milliliters of\npurulent material contained 183,000 polymorphonuclear leu-\nkocytes per mm3, 30,000 erythrocytes per mm3, and a glucose\nlevel of 4 mg/dl. Gram\u2019s stain revealed many polymorphonu-\nclear leukocytes but no organisms. Treatment with oral cefa-\nclor was initiated. Cultures for aerobic bacteria and mycobac-\nteria were subsequently negative, but a mould was isolated\nfrom the aspirated pus. The patient\u2019s signs and symptoms did\nnot improve with the antibiotic, and he developed a tempera-\nture of 101 to 1028F (;38.5 to 38.78C). Five days later his\nantibiotic treatment was empirically changed to oral dicloxacil-\nlin.\nAfter another week of antibacterial therapy, radiographs of\nthe right knee, tibia, and \ufb01bula were interpreted as normal. At\nthat time, another aspiration of the site was performed, yield-\ning 1.5 ml of \ufb02uid containing 2,600 leukocytes per mm3, 97% of\nwhich were polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and 21,300 eryth-\nrocytes per mm3. Bacterial and mycobacterial cultures were\nnegative, but fungal cultures of the aspirate again grew a\nmould morphologically identical to the \ufb01rst isolate.\nThe patient was then referred to an infectious disease spe-\ncialist. He appeared well and in no acute distress but walked\nwith a tentative gait that was limited by pain in his right leg. He\nwas afebrile. The right lower extremity contained a horseshoe-\nshaped area of warmth, erythema, induration, and tenderness\nanteriorly just below the knee. The knee joint itself exhibited\nfull range of motion without effusion. There were no ulcer-\nations or evidence of lymphangitis. An erythrocyte sedimenta-\ntion rate was 7 mm/h. Antibodies to human immunode\ufb01ciency\nvirus were not detected.\nA magnetic resonance imaging scan, performed 2 weeks\nafter the second aspiration, revealed extensive super\ufb01cial and\ndeep soft tissue involvement. The patient elected to pursue a\ncourse of leg immobilization and oral \ufb02uconazole (200 mg per\nos daily) rather than immediate surgery.\nThe microbiology laboratory identi\ufb01ed the mould isolate as\na Penicillium/Paecilomyces species, suspicious for Paecilomyces\nlilacinus. The identi\ufb01cation of Paecilomyces lilacinus was sub-\nsequently con\ufb01rmed (Fungus Testing Laboratory, San Anto-\nnio, Tex.).\nDespite continued oral antifungal therapy, a dull ache and\nswelling persisted in the leg, and plans were made for debride-\nment. He was admitted to the hospital 4 months after he was\n\ufb01rst evaluated by a physician and placed on intravenous mi-\nconazole because in vitro susceptibility testing indicated that\nthe isolate was resistant to \ufb02uconazole. Three days later the\nright anterior tibial soft tissue was debrided. Multiple frag-\nments of soft, pink tissue, measuring approximately 2.0 to 5.0\nby 1.0 to 2.0 by 0.5 to 1.5 cm, were excised. No gross evidence\nof extension to bone was noted; therefore, the surgeon elected\nnot to perform a bone biopsy. Microscopically, the connective\ntissue was replaced by con\ufb02uent caseating granulomas. Pali-\nsading of epithelioid macrophages was prominent, and multi-\nnucleated giant cells were present.

Acid-fast stains were negative.\nThe patient developed severe phlebitis from miconazole,\nand therapy was changed to oral ketoconazole (400 mg daily).\nHe was discharged 1 week after admission.\nAt follow-up approximately 3 weeks after surgery his wound\nwas healing very well. He denied any fever or chills but did\nreport an occasional achiness in the leg. The patient\u2019s overall\nsigns and symptoms were greatly improved, and he was begin-\nning physical therapy while continuing to take ketoconazole.\nPlain \ufb01lms of the knee and upper tibia, obtained approximately\n1 month after discharge, were normal.\nA repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan performed ap-\nproximately 8 months after initial presentation was normal\nwithout evidence of osteomyelitis. One week before that scan\nthe patient had stopped taking ketoconazole. Although he\nexperienced some chronic leg pain distal to his incision, he\ncontinued physical therapy and eventually returned to work. A\nfollow-up visit approximately 1 year postsurgery found him to\nbe pain free with no further complications.\nMicrobiological \ufb01ndings. Paecilomyces lilacinus was isolated\non two occasions from aspirates of the right infrapatellar bursa\nobtained 12 days apart. The fungus produced white, \ufb02occose\ncolonies within 3 days on Sabouraud dextrose agar with and\nwithout cycloheximide and chloramphenicol. After 4 days as\nconidia began to form, the mycelium developed a lilac-rose-red\ncolor, which became deeper as the colonies aged. Pigment\nproduction was enhanced by placing the fungus on potato\n\ufb02akes agar (21) and Czapek agar (29). The reverse side of the\ncolony was nonpigmented. The isolate was somewhat adherent\nto the agar.\nMicroscopic examination revealed branched phialides orga-\nnized as a \u2018\u2018penicillus,\u2019\u2019 initially suggesting a Penicillium spe-\ncies. On further examination with calco\ufb02uor white, numerous\nphialides that possessed long, constricted or tapered necks,\nsuggestive of Paecilomyces species, were observed. Primarily\noval conidia appeared in elongated chains. Conidia consis-\ntently measured 3.0 by 2.0 mm (Fig. 2). On the basis of these\nmicroscopic characteristics and the lilac pigment, Paecilomyces\nlilacinus was identi\ufb01ed.\nSusceptibility testing was performed (Fungus Testing Labo-\nratory) by the macro broth dilution method. The isolate was\nresistant to \ufb02uconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B\n(MICs of .64, .8, and .16 mg/ml, respectively), and suscep-\ntible to ketoconazole and miconazole (MICs of 1 and 0.5\nmg/ml, respectively).\nDiscussion.

Morphologi-\ncally, the fungus closely resembles members of the genus Pen-\nicillium, and disagreement continues to exist among experts as\nto the correct taxonomic designation (29). The diagnostic dif-\n\ufb01culty is re\ufb02ected in numerous case reports that describe an\ninitial laboratory identi\ufb01cation of Penicillium species before a\n\ufb01nal report of Paecilomyces lilacinus was issued (15, 19, 26, 27,\n29).\nDespite being prevalent in the environment, documented\nfungal infection by Paecilomyces lilacinus occurs very rarely.\nThis case represents the \ufb01rst report of complex soft tissue\ninfection with bursitis caused by this fungus in an immunocom-\npetent host. Several recently published reports (26, 29) and the\ncase we describe, suggest that Paecilomyces lilacinus may be\nemerging as an important pathogen.\nThe bulk of reported Paecilomyces lilacinus infections in-\nvolve the eye. Endophthalmitis has been described by several\ninvestigators (10, 13, 16, 18, 19). Twelve patients became in-\nfected when contaminated intraocular lenses (13, 18, 19) were\nunknowingly implanted. This outbreak illustrates the potential\nof this fungus to cause severe morbidity, as the majority of eyes\ninvolved were not salvageable, and its ability to survive com-\nmercial sterilization methods. Paecilomyces lilacinus has also\ncaused several episodes of keratitis (14, 27), an infected cor-\nneal transplant (6), and an orbital granuloma (1). Vision was\nimproved in the patients with keratitis after prompt medical\nintervention. A combination of aggressive antifungal therapy\nand a second transplant led to the resolution of the infection in\nthe patient reported by Gordon and Norton (6). Agrawal et al.\nreported resolution of the orbital infection with excentration,\nbut dissemination to neighboring tissue occurred despite sur-\ngery and amphotericin B therapy (1).\nDermatologic infection with Paecilomyces lilacinus consti-\ntutes the next largest group of published reports. Jade et al.\ndescribed a case of a deep cellulitis in an immunocompromised\npatient in which a favorable outcome was achieved only after\ncombination therapy with amphotericin B and \ufb02ucytosine (8).\nCastro et al. reported an infection caused by Paecilomyces\nlilacinus that was localized to the left forearm in a renal trans-\nplant patient. Their patient was cured with oral griseofulvin\n(500 mg/day) (2). Murciano et al. reported a cutaneous infec-\ntion with Paecilomyces lilacinus in a young girl with leukemia\n(15). This patient\u2019s course was complicated by persistent neu-\ntropenia, and she subsequently died. It was not clear whether\ndissemination had occurred because an autopsy was refused.\nTakayasu et al. described a case of cutaneous mycosis caused\nby Paecilomyces lilacinus in an immunocompetent host (28).\nThe fungus was repeatedly isolated from biopsy specimens\ntaken from lesions on the patient\u2019s left cheek, and hyphal\nelements were observed in tissue sections. The lesions were\ngreatly reduced in number with oral griseofulvin.\nAdditional accounts of Paecilomyces lilacinus infection in-\nclude two reports of chronic maxillary sinusitis (23, 24), both\ncured with surgical debridement, and a report of pulmonary\nmycosis (4) which required amphotericin B therapy. All three\ninfections occurred in immunocompetent hosts. Tan et al. de-\nscribed a recent case of catheter related fungemia in an im-\nmunocompromised pediatric patient (29). Removal of the\ncatheter and treatment with amphotericin B resulted in a cure.\nAnother recent report, by Silliman et al., implicates Paecilo-\nmyces lilacinus as the etiologic agent of two abdominal wall\nabscesses in a child with chronic granulomatous disease (26).\nAlthough the infection appeared to respond well to amphoter-\nicin B therapy, the child died 4 months later of an unrelated\ninfection. Paecilomyces lilacinus has also been reported as a\npathogen in animals (5) and insects (29).\nPaecilomyces species other than Paecilomyces lilacinus also\ncause occasional infection (9, 22). The majority of these in-\nvolve Paecilomyces variotii. Henig et al. described a case of\nPaecilomyces infection of the lacrimal sac, in which the species\nidenti\ufb01cation was not determined (7).\nGiven the ubiquity of Paecilomyces lilacinus in the environ-\nment (3, 9, 20, 22, 29), it is likely that the patient described in\nthis report acquired his infection through minor trauma to his\nknees while working as an auto mechanic. Although he did not\nremember any puncture wounds or breaks in his skin, he had\nspent considerable time on his knees before development of\nsymptoms.\nIt is interesting to note that the patient\u2019s knee had been\nmanipulated twice, including injection with a corticosteroid,\nbefore Paecilomyces lilacinus was isolated. Although introduc-\ntion of the fungus during aspiration or injection seems unlikely\nin this case, that possibility cannot be eliminated.\nNumerous strains of Paecilomyces lilacinus are capable of\nproducing potent mycotoxins (11, 12). Leucinostatins derived\nfrom cultures of the organism are highly toxic to experimental\nanimals and appear to have had a direct impact on the tissue\nin\ufb02ammatory response. Inoculation of leucinostatin directly\ninto the cornea of a rabbit resulted in abscess formation. These\n\ufb01ndings suggest that toxin production by Paecilomyces lilacinus\nmay be an important virulence factor (11, 12).\nThe therapy of invasive fungal infections usually includes the\nremoval of any foreign bodies or medical devices, debridement\nor excision of infected tissue, and/or treatment with antifungal\nchemotherapeutic agents. Susceptibility testing of moulds has\nnot yet been completely standardized or validated. A standard\nmacrotube MIC test has been proposed by the National Com-\nmittee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (17) and was used by\nthe reference laboratory for this isolate. For infrequent patho-\ngens, such as Paecilomyces lilacinus, construction of reliable\ninterpretative criteria for susceptibility tests is particularly dif-\n\ufb01cult.\nIn general, Paecilomyces variotii is susceptible in vitro to\ncommon antifungal chemotherapeutic agents, whereas Paecilo-\nmyces lilacinus is resistant to amphotericin B and \ufb02ucytosine\nbut susceptible to imidazole compounds. Despite in vitro sus-\nceptibility data, several reports already mentioned describe a\npositive outcome when amphotericin B was administered. Ex-\nplanations for this discrepancy may include strain differences\nof Paecilomyces lilacinus, responses to surgical or local mea-\nsures independent of amphotericin therapy, or that criteria for\nde\ufb01ning interpretation breakpoints need further re\ufb01nement.\nOral griseofulvin was also used successfully in two patients\ndescribed previously (2, 28).\nIn our case, cure was achieved with a combination of surgical\nexcision of infected tissue and prolonged administration of\nimidazole compounds to which the isolate was susceptible in\nvitro. Treatment with \ufb02uconazole alone (to which the isolate\nwas ultimately determined resistant in vitro) did not effect a\nclinical cure, although the mould could not be recovered from\ninfected tissue at the time of surgery.\nAlthough infection is uncommon, it is important for clini-\ncians and microbiologists to consider the potential pathogenic-\nity of any isolate of Paecilomyces lilacinus within the context of\nthe clinical factors. It is likely that this fungus will continue to\nbe implicated as a cause of invasive infection. Multiple isolates\nof a fungus from the same specimen and/or patient increases\nthe likelihood that the isolate is clinically signi\ufb01cant. Demon-\nstrating morphologically compatible fungi in tissue sections\nauthenticates the diagnosis.\nVOL. 34, 1996\nNOTES\n1561\n\nWe thank Wendy Haupt, Heidi Higgins-Cutler, Michele Kohn, and\nNikki Sawyer for technical assistance and Pat Woelly for secretarial\nassistance.\nREFERENCES\n1.

WINN1\nDepartment of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine1 and 1nfectious Diseases Unit, Department of Medicine,2 Fletcher\nAllen Health Care and the University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont\nReceived 12 February 1996/Returned for modi\ufb01cation 16 March 1996/Accepted 27 March 1996\nDocumented Paecilomyces lilacinus infections are quite rare. Most reports involve immunocompromised\npatients or implanted objects. We report the \ufb01rst case of complicated soft tissue infection caused by P. lilacinus\nin an immunocompetent host. The spectrum of infections involving this fungus is reviewed.\nPaecilomyces species are widely distributed throughout the\nenvironment. They are frequently detected in soil samples (3,\n5, 9, 16), decomposing vegetation (29), and as airborne con-\ntaminants (22).\nDespite its ubiquity, Paecilomyces lilacinus remains an un-\ncommon cause of fungal infections in humans. The majority of\ncase reports describe ocular infections (1, 6, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18,\n19, 27). Others have implicated Paecilomyces lilacinus as a\ncause of dermatologic infection (2, 8, 15, 28), sinusitis (23, 24),\npulmonary mycosis (4), an abdominal wall abscess (26), and\nfungemia related to an indwelling catheter (29). We describe\nthe \ufb01rst reported case of deep soft tissue infection with bursitis\ncaused by Paecilomyces lilacinus in an immunocompetent host.\nSurgery and prolonged antifungal therapy were required to\neradicate the infection.\nCase report. A 35-year-old male Caucasian presented to a\ngeneral internist complaining of pain and swelling below his\nright knee for 5 days. The patient was employed as an auto\nmechanic and stated that his pain began after working on his\nknees on a cement \ufb02oor. He did not recall any break in the skin\nor any injury involving a foreign body. A diagnosis of pretibial\neffusion was made, and \ufb02uid was aspirated. A swab culture of\nthe \ufb02uid for aerobic bacteria revealed no growth. The patient\nsaw a second physician shortly thereafter, with the same com-\nplaints. The area was again aspirated and then injected with a\ncorticosteroid. Cultures were not obtained.\nAlthough his symptoms improved brie\ufb02y, pain and swelling\nreturned 2 months later, at which time the patient was evalu-\nated by an orthopedic surgeon. A radiograph of the knee was\nnormal, and a clinical diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis was\nmade. One week later, he was examined by a rheumatologist,\nwho aspirated a \ufb02uctuant pretibial lesion. Four milliliters of\npurulent material contained 183,000 polymorphonuclear leu-\nkocytes per mm3, 30,000 erythrocytes per mm3, and a glucose\nlevel of 4 mg/dl. Gram\u2019s stain revealed many polymorphonu-\nclear leukocytes but no organisms. Treatment with oral cefa-\nclor was initiated. Cultures for aerobic bacteria and mycobac-\nteria were subsequently negative, but a mould was isolated\nfrom the aspirated pus. The patient\u2019s signs and symptoms did\nnot improve with the antibiotic, and he developed a tempera-\nture of 101 to 1028F (;38.5 to 38.78C). Five days later his\nantibiotic treatment was empirically changed to oral dicloxacil-\nlin.\nAfter another week of antibacterial therapy, radiographs of\nthe right knee, tibia, and \ufb01bula were interpreted as normal. At\nthat time, another aspiration of the site was performed, yield-\ning 1.5 ml of \ufb02uid containing 2,600 leukocytes per mm3, 97% of\nwhich were polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and 21,300 eryth-\nrocytes per mm3. Bacterial and mycobacterial cultures were\nnegative, but fungal cultures of the aspirate again grew a\nmould morphologically identical to the \ufb01rst isolate.\nThe patient was then referred to an infectious disease spe-\ncialist. He appeared well and in no acute distress but walked\nwith a tentative gait that was limited by pain in his right leg. He\nwas afebrile. The right lower extremity contained a horseshoe-\nshaped area of warmth, erythema, induration, and tenderness\nanteriorly just below the knee. The knee joint itself exhibited\nfull range of motion without effusion. There were no ulcer-\nations or evidence of lymphangitis. An erythrocyte sedimenta-\ntion rate was 7 mm/h. Antibodies to human immunode\ufb01ciency\nvirus were not detected.\nA magnetic resonance imaging scan, performed 2 weeks\nafter the second aspiration, revealed extensive super\ufb01cial and\ndeep soft tissue involvement. The patient elected to pursue a\ncourse of leg immobilization and oral \ufb02uconazole (200 mg per\nos daily) rather than immediate surgery.\nThe microbiology laboratory identi\ufb01ed the mould isolate as\na Penicillium/Paecilomyces species, suspicious for Paecilomyces\nlilacinus. The identi\ufb01cation of Paecilomyces lilacinus was sub-\nsequently con\ufb01rmed (Fungus Testing Laboratory, San Anto-\nnio, Tex.).\nDespite continued oral antifungal therapy, a dull ache and\nswelling persisted in the leg, and plans were made for debride-\nment. He was admitted to the hospital 4 months after he was\n\ufb01rst evaluated by a physician and placed on intravenous mi-\nconazole because in vitro susceptibility testing indicated that\nthe isolate was resistant to \ufb02uconazole. Three days later the\nright anterior tibial soft tissue was debrided. Multiple frag-\nments of soft, pink tissue, measuring approximately 2.0 to 5.0\nby 1.0 to 2.0 by 0.5 to 1.5 cm, were excised. No gross evidence\nof extension to bone was noted; therefore, the surgeon elected\nnot to perform a bone biopsy. Microscopically, the comective\ntissue was replaced by con\ufb02uent caseating granulomas. Pali-\nsading of epithelioid macrophages was prominent, and multi-\nnucleated giant cells were present.

Acid-fast stains were negative.\nThe patient developed severe phlebitis from miconazole,\nand therapy was changed to oral ketoconazole (400 mg daily).\nHe was discharged 1 week after admission.\nAt follow-up approximately 3 weeks after surgery his wound\nwas healing very well. He denied any fever or chills but did\nreport an occasional achiness in the leg. The patient\u2019s overall\nsigns and symptoms were greatly improved, and he was begin-\nning physical therapy while continuing to take ketoconazole.\nPlain \ufb01lms of the knee and upper tibia, obtained approximately\n1 month after discharge, were normal.\nA repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan performed ap-\nproximately 8 months after initial presentation was normal\nwithout evidence of osteomyelitis. One week before that scan\nthe patient had stopped taking ketoconazole. Although he\nexperienced some chronic leg pain distal to his incision, he\ncontinued physical therapy and eventually returned to work. A\nfollow-up visit approximately 1 year postsurgery found him to\nbe pain free with no further complications.\nMicrobiological \ufb01ndings. Paecilomyces lilacinus was isolated\non two occasions from aspirates of the right infrapatellar bursa\nobtained 12 days apart. The fungus produced white, \ufb02occose\ncolonies within 3 days on Sabouraud dextrose agar with and\nwithout cycloheximide and chloramphenicol. After 4 days as\nconidia began to form, the mycelium developed a lilac-rose-red\ncolor, which became deeper as the colonies aged. Pigment\nproduction was enhanced by placing the fungus on potato\n\ufb02akes agar (21) and Czapek agar (29). The reverse side of the\ncolony was nonpigmented. The isolate was somewhat adherent\nto the agar.\nMicroscopic examination revealed branched phialides orga-\nnized as a \u2018\u2018penicillus,\u2019\u2019 initially suggesting a Penicillium spe-\ncies. On further examination with calco\ufb02uor white, numerous\nphialides that possessed long, constricted or tapered necks,\nsuggestive of Paecilomyces species, were observed. Primarily\noval conidia appeared in elongated chains. Conidia consis-\ntently measured 3.0 by 2.0 mm (Fig. 2). On the basis of these\nmicroscopic characteristics and the lilac pigment, Paecilomyces\nlilacinus was identi\ufb01ed.\nSusceptibility testing was performed (Fungus Testing Labo-\nratory) by the macro broth dilution method. The isolate was\nresistant to \ufb02uconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B\n(MICs of .64, .8, and .16 mg/ml, respectively), and suscep-\ntible to ketoconazole and miconazole (MICs of 1 and 0.5\nmg/ml, respectively).\nDiscussion.

Morphologi-\ncally, the fungus closely resembles members of the genus Pen-\nicillium, and disagreement continues to exist among experts as\nto the correct taxonomic designation (29). The diagnostic dif-\n\ufb01culty is re\ufb02ected in numerous case reports that describe an\ninitial laboratory identi\ufb01cation of Penicillium species before a\n\ufb01nal report of Paecilomyces lilacinus was issued (15, 19, 26, 27,\n29).\nDespite being prevalent in the environment, documented\nfungal infection by Paecilomyces lilacinus occurs very rarely.\nThis case represents the \ufb01rst report of complex soft tissue\ninfection with bursitis caused by this fungus in an immunocom-\npetent host. Several recently published reports (26, 29) and the\ncase we describe, suggest that Paecilomyces lilacinus may be\nemerging as an important pathogen.\nThe bulk of reported Paecilomyces lilacinus infections in-\nvolve the eye. Endophthalmitis has been described by several\ninvestigators (10, 13, 16, 18, 19). Twelve patients became in-\nfected when contaminated intraocular lenses (13, 18, 19) were\nunknowingly implanted. This outbreak illustrates the potential\nof this fungus to cause severe morbidity, as the majority of eyes\ninvolved were not salvageable, and its ability to survive com-\nmercial sterilization methods. Paecilomyces lilacinus has also\ncaused several episodes of keratitis (14, 27), an infected cor-\nneal transplant (6), and an orbital granuloma (1). Vision was\nimproved in the patients with keratitis after prompt medical\nintervention. A combination of aggressive antifungal therapy\nand a second transplant led to the resolution of the infection in\nthe patient reported by Gordon and Norton (6). Agrawal et al.\nreported resolution of the orbital infection with excentration,\nbut dissemination to neighboring tissue occurred despite sur-\ngery and amphotericin B therapy (1).\nDermatologic infection with Paecilomyces lilacinus consti-\ntutes the next largest group of published reports. Jade et al.\ndescribed a case of a deep cellulitis in an immunocompromised\npatient in which a favorable outcome was achieved only after\ncombination therapy with amphotericin B and \ufb02ucytosine (8).\nCastro et al. reported an infection caused by Paecilomyces\nlilacinus that was localized to the left forearm in a renal trans-\nplant patient. Their patient was cured with oral griseofulvin\n(500 mg/day) (2). Murciano et al. reported a cutaneous infec-\ntion with Paecilomyces lilacinus in a young girl with leukemia\n(15). This patient\u2019s course was complicated by persistent neu-\ntropenia, and she subsequently died. 1t was not clear whether\ndissemination had occurred because an autopsy was refused.\nTakayasu et al. described a case of cutaneous mycosis caused\nby Paecilomyces lilacinus in an immunocompetent host (28).\nThe fungus was repeatedly isolated from biopsy specimens\ntaken from lesions on the patient\u2019s left cheek, and hyphal\nelements were observed in tissue sections. The lesions were\ngreatly reduced in number with oral griseofulvin.\nAdditional accounts of Paecilomyces lilacinus infection in-\nclude two reports of chronic maxillary sinusitis (23, 24), both\ncured with surgical debridement, and a report of pulmonary\nmycosis (4) which required amphotericin B therapy. All three\ninfections occurred in immunocompetent hosts. Tan et al. de-\nscribed a recent case of catheter related fungemia in an im-\nmunocompromised pediatric patient (29). Removal of the\ncatheter and treatment with amphotericin B resulted in a cure.\nAnother recent report, by Silliman et al., implicates Paecilo-\nmyces lilacinus as the etiologic agent of two abdominal wall\nabscesses in a child with chronic granulomatous disease (26).\nAlthough the infection appeared to respond well to amphoter-\nicin B therapy, the child died 4 months later of an unrelated\ninfection. Paecilomyces lilacinus has also been reported as a\npathogen in animals (5) and insects (29).\nPaecilomyces species other than Paecilomyces lilacinus also\ncause occasional infection (9, 22). The majority of these in-\nvolve Paecilomyces variotii. Henig et al. described a case of\nPaecilomyces infection of the lacrimal sac, in which the species\nidenti\ufb01cation was not determined (7).\nGiven the ubiquity of Paecilomyces lilacinus in the environ-\nment (3, 9, 20, 22, 29), it is likely that the patient described in\nthis report acquired his infection through minor trauma to his\nknees while working as an auto mechanic. Although he did not\nremember any puncture wounds or breaks in his skin, he had\nspent considerable time on his knees before development of\nsymptoms. 1t is interesting to note that the patient\u2019s knee had been\nmanipulated twice, including injection with a corticosteroid,\nbefore Paecilomyces lilacinus was isolated. Although introduc-\ntion of the fungus during aspiration or injection seems unlikely\nin this case, that possibility camot be eliminated.\nNumerous strains of Paecilomyces lilacinus are capable of\nproducing potent mycotoxins (11, 12). Leucinostatins derived\nfrom cultures of the organism are highly toxic to experimental\nanimals and appear to have had a direct impact on the tissue\nin\ufb02ammatory response. 1noculation of leucinostatin directly\ninto the cornea of a rabbit resulted in abscess formation. These\n\ufb01ndings suggest that toxin production by Paecilomyces lilacinus\nmay be an important virulence factor (11, 12).\nThe therapy of invasive fungal infections usually includes the\nremoval of any foreign bodies or medical devices, debridement\nor excision of infected tissue, and/or treatment with antifungal\nchemotherapeutic agents. Susceptibility testing of moulds has\nnot yet been completely standardized or validated. A standard\nmacrotube MIC test has been proposed by the National Com-\nmittee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (17) and was used by\nthe reference laboratory for this isolate. For infrequent patho-\ngens, such as Paecilomyces lilacinus, construction of reliable\ninterpretative criteria for susceptibility tests is particularly dif-\n\ufb01cult. 1n general, Paecilomyces variotii is susceptible in vitro to\ncommon antifungal chemotherapeutic agents, whereas Paecilo-\nmyces lilacinus is resistant to amphotericin B and \ufb02ucytosine\nbut susceptible to imidazole compounds. Despite in vitro sus-\nceptibility data, several reports already mentioned describe a\npositive outcome when amphotericin B was administered. Ex-\nplanations for this discrepancy may include strain differences\nof Paecilomyces lilacinus, responses to surgical or local mea-\nsures independent of amphotericin therapy, or that criteria for\nde\ufb01ning interpretation breakpoints need further re\ufb01nement.\nOral griseofulvin was also used successfully in two patients\ndescribed previously (2, 28). 1n our case, cure was achieved with a combination of surgical\nexcision of infected tissue and prolonged administration of\nimidazole compounds to which the isolate was susceptible in\nvitro. Treatment with \ufb02uconazole alone (to which the isolate\nwas ultimately determined resistant in vitro) did not effect a\nclinical cure, although the mould could not be recovered from\ninfected tissue at the time of surgery.\nAlthough infection is uncommon, it is important for clini-\ncians and microbiologists to consider the potential pathogenic-\nity of any isolate of Paecilomyces lilacinus within the context of\nthe clinical factors. 1t is likely that this fungus will continue to\nbe implicated as a cause of invasive infection. Multiple isolates\nof a fungus from the same specimen and/or patient increases\nthe likelihood that the isolate is clinically signi\ufb01cant. Demon-\nstrating morphologically compatible fungi in tissue sections\nauthenticates the diagnosis.\nVOL. 34, 1996\nNOTES\n1561\n\nWe thank Wendy Haupt, Heidi Higgins-Cutler, Michele Kohn, and\nNikki Sawyer for technical assistance and Pat Woelly for secretarial\nassistance.\nREFERENCES\n1.

A sequence-based approach was used to assign the isolate to a species.\nCASE REPORT\nA 64-year-old woman with no signi\ufb01cant ophthalmic or sys-\ntemic history presented with a history of pain, redness, and\ndefective vision of the right eye of 4 days\u2019 duration following a\nminor trauma sustained by mud splashing into the eye. She had\nbeen treated elsewhere earlier, and her medications consisted\nof the use of tobramycin, phenylephrine, natamycin, and moxi-\n\ufb02oxacin eye drops for 1 day.\nOn examination, her uncorrected visual acuity was less than\n20/800 (\u00021/60) in the right eye. Slit lamp examination of the\nright eye was signi\ufb01cant for an area of in\ufb01ltration (6.2 to 7.5\nmm) involving the central cornea and extending toward the\nlimbus temporally and superiorly. The in\ufb01ltrate involved all the\nlayers of the stroma, and there was a dense endothelial plaque.\nA hypopyon of 1 mm was present. Scrapings obtained from the\ncorneal in\ufb01ltrate were stained (Gram\u2019s stain and 10% KOH)\nand plated on 5% sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and potato\ndextrose agar. Both the Gram stain and the KOH mounts were\npositive for fungal \ufb01laments, and the cultures subsequently\ngrew a fungus which was initially identi\ufb01ed as a member of\nAspergillus section Flavi.\nGiven the severity of the infection, the patient was admitted\nto the hospital, and intensive topical antifungal therapy was\ninitiated. Natamycin (5%) and econazole (2%) eye drops were\nstarted on a half-hourly basis, while itraconazole (1%) eye\nointment was applied three times a day. This was supple-\nmented with cycloplegics (homatropine) and medication for\nthe relief of pain. Oral antifungal medication in the form of\ntablets (200 mg ketoconazole twice a day) was also given. 1n spite of intensive therapy, the in\ufb01ltrate continued to\nprogress with thinning and melting of the cornea. Doxycy-\ncline tablets were administered to decrease the collageno-\nlytic activity, and amphotericin B (50 \u0003g/ml) eye drops were\nalso added to the medical regimen, but the in\ufb01ltrate con-\ntinued to progress to involve the entire cornea with descem-\netocele formation and \ufb01nally perforation. A therapeutic\npenetrating keratoplasty was performed 16 days after pre-\nsentation. Scleral extension was noted intraoperatively at\nthe superior limbus. The corneal button removed at the time\nof surgery was also positive for a heavy growth of Aspergillus.\nPostoperatively the same medical regimen was continued in\na tapering fashion, and the patient was discharged on the\n10th postoperative day. After an interval of 35 days postop-\neratively, she once again presented with an area of in\ufb01ltra-\ntion at 11 o\u2019clock of the superior sclera; this was treated\nsuccessfully medically, and the in\ufb01ltrate healed in a week.\nShe was asked to continue natamycin and econazole (2%)\nfour times a day along with itraconazole (1%) eye ointment\nthree times and homatropine (2%) eye drops twice a day.\nThe patient was lost to follow-up until 40 days later, when\nshe presented with pain and redness. Examination was remark-\nable for the presence of a tender nodule involving an area of\nthe sclera from 7 o\u2019clock to 9 o\u2019clock. The patient was once\nagain placed on intensive antifungal therapy with amphotericin\nB (50 \u0003g/ml) eye drops and econazole (2%) eye drops being\nadministered half-hourly, along with itraconazole (1%) eye\nointment three times a day and ketoconazole (200 mg) twice\ndaily. She was once again lost to follow-up and presented\nintermittently over the next 5 months with scleral involvement,\neither active scleritis or involvement with ocular congestion.\nThroughout the follow-up period, her vision in the right eye\ncontinued to be perception of light. The graft continued to be\nedematous.\nHer compliance continued to be poor. At each presentation,\nshe was placed on topical and systemic antifungals as well as\ntopical and systemic nonsteroid anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs. Ther-\napy always provided symptomatic relief as well as resolution of\nsigns of scleritis. She was last seen 9 months after the initial\npresentation. Her vision in the right eye was positive for per-\nception of light. An area of scleral thinning extending from 7 to\n* Corresponding author.

The case isolate was sub-\ncultured on Czapek Dox yeast extract and malt extract agar\nplates for morphological identi\ufb01cation. The fungus was\nidenti\ufb01ed as Aspergillus species from section Flavi based on\ncolony morphology and microscopic features of the isolate\n(Fig. 1). Colony surface on Czapek Dox yeast extract was\nvelvety to \ufb02occose, consisting of white or light orange-brown\nvegetative mycelium and sparse to moderately abundant\nconidial structures. Colony reverse was light yellow or or-\nange-brown. Sclerotia could not be observed. Conidio-\nphores were variable in length (600 to 1,500 mm), uncol-\nored,\nand\nechinulate\n(Fig.\n1A).\nConidial\nheads\nwere\nyellowish green, biseriate, and radiate, often splitting into\nseveral columns. Vesicles were globose to subglobose, 45 to\n65 \u0003m in diameter. Conidia were globose to subglobose,\nechinulate, and 4 to 6 \u0003m in diameter (Fig. 1B). Living\ncultures were deposited at the Department of Microbiology,\nAravind\nEye\nHospital\nand\nPostgraduate 1nstitute\nof\nOphthalmology, Coimbatore, 1ndia (strain number: 823/07),\nand at the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS\n123901).\nFor the purposes of molecular identi\ufb01cation, mycelia\ngrown in liquid YPG medium (0.5% Bacto yeast extract,\n0.5% Bacto peptone, 1% glucose) for 1 day were subjected\nto DNA isolation by the Masterpure yeast DNA puri\ufb01cation\nkit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) region of the rRNA gene complex, incorporat-\ning 1TS1, the 5.8S rRNA gene, and 1TS2, was ampli\ufb01ed\nusing primers 1TS1 and 1TS4 (31). Part of the calmodulin\ngene was ampli\ufb01ed using the primers cmd5 and cmd6 as\ndescribed by Hong et al. (12), while a segment of the \u0004-tu-\nbulin gene was ampli\ufb01ed using primers bT2a and bT2b (10).\nDNA sequences were determined using a BigDye Termina-\ntor v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems 1nc., Fos-\nter City, CA) and an ABI 3100 DNA sequencer. Sequence\nanalysis was carried out by BLASTN similarity search at the\nwebsite of the National Center for Biotechnology 1nforma-\ntion (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) (2). Molecular\nidenti\ufb01cation based on sequence analysis of 1TS, \u0004-tubulin,\nand calmodulin sequences revealed that the isolate belongs\nto the species Aspergillus nomius.\nAntifungal susceptibility testing. The Etest method (AB\nBiodisk, Solna, Sweden) for molds was used to determine the\nMICs of the isolate to amphotericin B, \ufb02uconazole, itracon-\nazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin. 1n accor-\ndance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, RPMI 1640 agar\n(15 g in 1,000 ml) supplemented with 20 g glucose per 1,000 ml\nmedium was used in the tests (1). The MICs of natamycin\n(Natamet; 5% suspension; Sun Pharmaceutical 1nd. Ltd., Halol, 1ndia), econazole (Aurozole; 2% suspension; Aurolab, Madu-\nrai, 1ndia), and clotrimazole (Auroclot; 1% suspension; Auro-\nlab, Madurai, 1ndia) were determined by the broth microdilu-\ntion technique NCCLS M38-A (22). Both the Etest and\nmicrodilution plates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 72 h. Candida\nparapsilosis ATCC 22019 was used as the quality control for\neconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and amphotericin B\nduring the susceptibility tests. Results obtained for these\nstrains were in accordance with the quality control ranges pub-\nlished previously for these isolates (11, 24). Results of antifun-\nFIG. 1.

A recent\npaper reported a corneal ulcer due to Aspergillus tamarii (15),\nsuggesting that members of Aspergillus section Flavi other than\nA. \ufb02avus may also be potential causative agents of mycotic\nkeratitis.\nAspergillus nomius Kurtzman, Horn & Hesseltine is morpho-\nlogically a highly variable species which is dif\ufb01cult to classify by\nconventional criteria (8, 17). 1solates of this species can pro-\nduce variously sized sclerotia including the originally described\nindeterminate ones considered characteristic of this species\n(18), as well as S-type sclerotia (6).\nAs an a\ufb02atoxin-producing member of Aspergillus section\nFlavi, A. nomius can convert sterigmatocystin to a\ufb02atoxin.\nWhile A. \ufb02avus normally produces only B-type a\ufb02atoxins, A.\nnomius is able to produce both series B (B1 and B2) and G (G1\nand G2) a\ufb02atoxins, similarly to Aspergillus parasiticus (5). A\nrecent study of soil samples from Thailand demonstrated that\nA. nomius is more widespread than may be commonly thought;\nit can be the predominant a\ufb02atoxin-producing Aspergillus spe-\ncies at certain geographic locations and must be considered a\npotential etiological agent of a\ufb02atoxin contamination events\ndue to its ability to produce large quantities of a\ufb02atoxins (6).\nA. nomius can be distinguished from other members of As-\npergillus section Flavi by a number of molecular techniques (3,\n4, 7, 8, 16\u201318, 20, 21, 30), including sequence analysis of the 1TS regions (6, 27), as was done in this study. 1t was hypothe-\nsized that A. nomius diverged from a common ancestor prior to\nthe divergence of A. \ufb02avus (5, 7). Phylogenetic analyses based\non coding sequences of the a\ufb02atoxin pathway regulatory gene\na\ufb02R and the a\ufb02J-a\ufb02R intergenic sequence suggested that A.\nnomius is a diverse paraphyletic assemblage likely to contain\nseveral species (7).\nA. nomius shows a cosmopolitan distribution (4, 6, 7, 9, 13,\n14, 16\u201318, 23, 25, 26, 28), including previous isolation from red\nsoil in 1ndia (20); thus, the mud falling into the eye of the\npatient can be considered the possible source of the infection.\nThe fact that the patient missed scheduled postoperative fol-\nlow-up visits possibly contributed to the complications. 1t is\nuncertain whether the repeated episodes of scleral involve-\nment were due to the spread of infection from the involved\nareas as noted during surgery or to recurrence of infection due\nto poor compliance. However, since this is the \ufb01rst such re-\nported case of A. nomius infection, all possibilities remain\nhypothetical.\nTo our knowledge, the presented case of fungal keratitis is\nthe \ufb01rst report on an ocular infection caused by A. nomius and,\nfurthermore, the \ufb01rst known case of human disease with the\ninvolvement of this species from Aspergillus section Flavi.\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The GenBank ac-\ncession numbers for the sequences of the case isolate are\nGQ221261 (ITS), GQ221262 (\u0004-tubulin), and GQ221263 (cal-\nmodulin).\nThis work was supported by the 1ndian National Science Acad-\nemy and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences within the frames of\nthe 1ndo-Hungarian bilateral exchange program No.IA/INSA-HAS\nProject/2007 and by the intergovernmental project DST-Te\n\u00b4T OMFB-\n00285/2008.

Slit lamp examination of the\nright eye was signi\ufb01cant for an area of in\ufb01ltration (6.2 to 7.5\nmm) involving the central cornea and extending toward the\nlimbus temporally and superiorly. The in\ufb01ltrate involved all the\nlayers of the stroma, and there was a dense endothelial plaque.\nA hypopyon of 1 mm was present. Scrapings obtained from the\ncorneal in\ufb01ltrate were stained (Gram\u2019s stain and 10% KOH)\nand plated on 5% sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and potato\ndextrose agar. Both the Gram stain and the KOH mounts were\npositive for fungal \ufb01laments, and the cultures subsequently\ngrew a fungus which was initially identi\ufb01ed as a member of\nAspergillus section Flavi.\nGiven the severity of the infection, the patient was admitted\nto the hospital, and intensive topical antifungal therapy was\ninitiated. Natamycin (5%) and econazole (2%) eye drops were\nstarted on a half-hourly basis, while itraconazole (1%) eye\nointment was applied three times a day. This was supple-\nmented with cycloplegics (homatropine) and medication for\nthe relief of pain. Oral antifungal medication in the form of\ntablets (200 mg ketoconazole twice a day) was also given.\nIn spite of intensive therapy, the in\ufb01ltrate continued to\nprogress with thiming and melting of the cornea. Doxycy-\ncline tablets were administered to decrease the collageno-\nlytic activity, and amphotericin B (50 \u0003g/ml) eye drops were\nalso added to the medical regimen, but the in\ufb01ltrate con-\ntinued to progress to involve the entire cornea with descem-\netocele formation and \ufb01nally perforation. A therapeutic\npenetrating keratoplasty was performed 16 days after pre-\nsentation. Scleral extension was noted intraoperatively at\nthe superior limbus. The corneal button removed at the time\nof surgery was also positive for a heavy growth of Aspergillus.\nPostoperatively the same medical regimen was continued in\na tapering fashion, and the patient was discharged on the\n10th postoperative day. After an interval of 35 days postop-\neratively, she once again presented with an area of in\ufb01ltra-\ntion at 11 o\u2019clock of the superior sclera; this was treated\nsuccessfully medically, and the in\ufb01ltrate healed in a week.\nShe was asked to continue natamycin and econazole (2%)\nfour times a day along with itraconazole (1%) eye ointment\nthree times and homatropine (2%) eye drops twice a day.\nThe patient was lost to follow-up until 40 days later, when\nshe presented with pain and redness. Examination was remark-\nable for the presence of a tender nodule involving an area of\nthe sclera from 7 o\u2019clock to 9 o\u2019clock. The patient was once\nagain placed on intensive antifungal therapy with amphotericin\nB (50 \u0003g/ml) eye drops and econazole (2%) eye drops being\nadministered half-hourly, along with itraconazole (1%) eye\nointment three times a day and ketoconazole (200 mg) twice\ndaily. She was once again lost to follow-up and presented\nintermittently over the next 5 months with scleral involvement,\neither active scleritis or involvement with ocular congestion.\nThroughout the follow-up period, her vision in the right eye\ncontinued to be perception of light. The graft continued to be\nedematous.\nHer compliance continued to be poor. At each presentation,\nshe was placed on topical and systemic antifungals as well as\ntopical and systemic nonsteroid anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs. Ther-\napy always provided symptomatic relief as well as resolution of\nsigns of scleritis. She was last seen 9 months after the initial\npresentation. Her vision in the right eye was positive for per-\nception of light. An area of scleral thiming extending from 7 to\n* Corresponding author.

The case isolate was sub-\ncultured on Czapek Dox yeast extract and malt extract agar\nplates for morphological identi\ufb01cation. The fungus was\nidenti\ufb01ed as Aspergillus species from section Flavi based on\ncolony morphology and microscopic features of the isolate\n(Fig. 1). Colony surface on Czapek Dox yeast extract was\nvelvety to \ufb02occose, consisting of white or light orange-brown\nvegetative mycelium and sparse to moderately abundant\nconidial structures. Colony reverse was light yellow or or-\nange-brown. Sclerotia could not be observed. Conidio-\nphores were variable in length (600 to 1,500 mm), uncol-\nored,\nand\nechinulate\n(Fig.\n1A).\nConidial\nheads\nwere\nyellowish green, biseriate, and radiate, often splitting into\nseveral columns. Vesicles were globose to subglobose, 45 to\n65 \u0003m in diameter. Conidia were globose to subglobose,\nechinulate, and 4 to 6 \u0003m in diameter (Fig. 1B). Living\ncultures were deposited at the Department of Microbiology,\nAravind\nEye\nHospital\nand\nPostgraduate\nInstitute\nof\nOphthalmology, Coimbatore, India (strain number: 823/07),\nand at the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS\n123901).\nFor the purposes of molecular identi\ufb01cation, mycelia\ngrown in liquid YPG medium (0.5% Bacto yeast extract,\n0.5% Bacto peptone, 1% glucose) for 1 day were subjected\nto DNA isolation by the Masterpure yeast DNA puri\ufb01cation\nkit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) region of the rRNA gene complex, incorporat-\ning ITS1, the 5.8S rRNA gene, and ITS2, was ampli\ufb01ed\nusing primers ITS1 and ITS4 (31). Part of the calmodulin\ngene was ampli\ufb01ed using the primers cmd5 and cmd6 as\ndescribed by Hong et al. (12), while a segment of the \u0004-tu-\nbulin gene was ampli\ufb01ed using primers bT2a and bT2b (10).\nDNA sequences were determined using a BigDye Termina-\ntor v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Fos-\nter City, CA) and an ABI 3100 DNA sequencer. Sequence\nanalysis was carried out by BLASTN similarity search at the\nwebsite of the National Center for Biotechnology Informa-\ntion (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) (2). Molecular\nidenti\ufb01cation based on sequence analysis of ITS, \u0004-tubulin,\nand calmodulin sequences revealed that the isolate belongs\nto the species Aspergillus nomius.\nAntifungal susceptibility testing. The Etest method (AB\nBiodisk, Solna, Sweden) for molds was used to determine the\nMICs of the isolate to amphotericin B, \ufb02uconazole, itracon-\nazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin. In accor-\ndance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, RPMI 1640 agar\n(15 g in 1,000 ml) supplemented with 20 g glucose per 1,000 ml\nmedium was used in the tests (1). The MICs of natamycin\n(Natamet; 5% suspension; Sun Pharmaceutical Ind. Ltd., Halol,\nIndia), econazole (Aurozole; 2% suspension; Aurolab, Madu-\nrai, India), and clotrimazole (Auroclot; 1% suspension; Auro-\nlab, Madurai, India) were determined by the broth microdilu-\ntion technique NCCLS M38-A (22). Both the Etest and\nmicrodilution plates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 72 h. Candida\nparapsilosis ATCC 22019 was used as the quality control for\neconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and amphotericin B\nduring the susceptibility tests.

A recent\npaper reported a corneal ulcer due to Aspergillus tamarii (15),\nsuggesting that members of Aspergillus section Flavi other than\nA. \ufb02avus may also be potential causative agents of mycotic\nkeratitis.\nAspergillus nomius Kurtzman, Horn & Hesseltine is morpho-\nlogically a highly variable species which is dif\ufb01cult to classify by\nconventional criteria (8, 17). Isolates of this species can pro-\nduce variously sized sclerotia including the originally described\nindeterminate ones considered characteristic of this species\n(18), as well as S-type sclerotia (6).\nAs an a\ufb02atoxin-producing member of Aspergillus section\nFlavi, A. nomius can convert sterigmatocystin to a\ufb02atoxin.\nWhile A. \ufb02avus normally produces only B-type a\ufb02atoxins, A.\nnomius is able to produce both series B (B1 and B2) and G (G1\nand G2) a\ufb02atoxins, similarly to Aspergillus parasiticus (5). A\nrecent study of soil samples from Thailand demonstrated that\nA. nomius is more widespread than may be commonly thought;\nit can be the predominant a\ufb02atoxin-producing Aspergillus spe-\ncies at certain geographic locations and must be considered a\npotential etiological agent of a\ufb02atoxin contamination events\ndue to its ability to produce large quantities of a\ufb02atoxins (6).\nA. nomius can be distinguished from other members of As-\npergillus section Flavi by a number of molecular techniques (3,\n4, 7, 8, 16\u201318, 20, 21, 30), including sequence analysis of the\nITS regions (6, 27), as was done in this study. It was hypothe-\nsized that A. nomius diverged from a common ancestor prior to\nthe divergence of A. \ufb02avus (5, 7). Phylogenetic analyses based\non coding sequences of the a\ufb02atoxin pathway regulatory gene\na\ufb02R and the a\ufb02J-a\ufb02R intergenic sequence suggested that A.\nnomius is a diverse paraphyletic assemblage likely to contain\nseveral species (7).\nA. nomius shows a cosmopolitan distribution (4, 6, 7, 9, 13,\n14, 16\u201318, 23, 25, 26, 28), including previous isolation from red\nsoil in India (20); thus, the mud falling into the eye of the\npatient can be considered the possible source of the infection.\nThe fact that the patient missed scheduled postoperative fol-\nlow-up visits possibly contributed to the complications. It is\nuncertain whether the repeated episodes of scleral involve-\nment were due to the spread of infection from the involved\nareas as noted during surgery or to recurrence of infection due\nto poor compliance. However, since this is the \ufb01rst such re-\nported case of A. nomius infection, all possibilities remain\nhypothetical.\nTo our knowledge, the presented case of fungal keratitis is\nthe \ufb01rst report on an ocular infection caused by A. nomius and,\nfurthermore, the \ufb01rst known case of human disease with the\ninvolvement of this species from Aspergillus section Flavi.\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The GenBank ac-\ncession numbers for the sequences of the case isolate are\nGQ221261 (ITS), GQ221262 (\u0004-tubulin), and GQ221263 (cal-\nmodulin).\nThis work was supported by the Indian National Science Acad-\nemy and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences within the frames of\nthe Indo-Hungarian bilateral exchange program No.IA/INSA-HAS\nProject/2007 and by the intergovernmental project DST-Te\n\u00b4T OMFB-\n00285/2008.

Ocular injury was known as\na predisposing factor. The patient was treated with natamycin and econazole eye drops, itraconazole eye\nointment, and oral ketoconazole. A therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty was performed 16 days after presen-\ntation. A sequence-based approach was used to assign the isolate to a species.\nCASE REPORT\nA 64-year-old woman with no signi\ufb01cant ophthalmic or sys-\ntemic history presented with a history of pain, redness, and\ndefective vision of the right eye of 4 days\u2019 duration following a\nminor trauma sustained by mud splashing into the eye. She had\nbeen treated elsewhere earlier, and her medications consisted\nof the use of tobramycin, phenylephrine, natamycin, and moxi-\n\ufb02oxacin eye drops for 1 day.\nOn examination, her uncorrected visual acuity was less than\n20/800 (\u00021/60) in the right eye. Slit lamp examination of the\nright eye was signi\ufb01cant for an area of in\ufb01ltration (6.2 to 7.5\nmm) involving the central cornea and extending toward the\nlimbus temporally and superiorly. The in\ufb01ltrate involved all the\nlayers of the stroma, and there was a dense endothelial plaque.\nA hypopyon of 1 mm was present. Scrapings obtained from the\ncorneal in\ufb01ltrate were stained (Gram\u2019s stain and 10% KOH)\nand plated on 5% sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and potato\ndextrose agar. Both the Gram stain and the KOH mounts were\npositive for fungal \ufb01laments, and the cultures subsequently\ngrew a fungus which was initially identi\ufb01ed as a member of\nAspergillus section Flavi.\nGiven the severity of the infection, the patient was admitted\nto the hospital, and intensive topical antifungal therapy was\ninitiated. Natamycin (5%) and econazole (2%) eye drops were\nstarted on a half-hourly basis, while itraconazole (1%) eye\nointment was applied three times a day. This was supple-\nmented with cycloplegics (homatropine) and medication for\nthe relief of pain. Oral antifungal medication in the form of\ntablets (200 mg ketoconazole twice a day) was also given.\nIn spite of intensive therapy, the in\ufb01ltrate continued to\nprogress with thinning and melting of the cornea. Doxycy-\ncline tablets were administered to decrease the collageno-\nlytic activity, and amphotericin B (50 \u0003g/ml) eye drops were\nalso added to the medical regimen, but the in\ufb01ltrate con-\ntinued to progress to involve the entire cornea with descem-\netocele formation and \ufb01nally perforation. A therapeutic\npenetrating keratoplasty was performed 16 days after pre-\nsentation. Scleral extension was noted intraoperatively at\nthe superior limbus. The corneal button removed at the time\nof surgery was also positive for a heavy growth of Aspergillus.\nPostoperatively the same medical regimen was continued in\na tapering fashion, and the patient was discharged on the\n10th postoperative day. After an interval of 35 days postop-\neratively, she once again presented with an area of in\ufb01ltra-\ntion at 11 o\u2019clock of the superior sclera; this was treated\nsuccessfully medically, and the in\ufb01ltrate healed in a week.\nShe was asked to continue natamycin and econazole (2%)\nfour times a day along with itraconazole (1%) eye ointment\nthree times and homatropine (2%) eye drops twice a day.\nThe patient was lost to follow-up until 40 days later, when\nshe presented with pain and redness. Examination was remark-\nable for the presence of a tender nodule involving an area of\nthe sclera from 7 o\u2019clock to 9 o\u2019clock. The patient was once\nagain placed on intensive antifungal therapy with amphotericin\nB (50 \u0003g/ml) eye drops and econazole (2%) eye drops being\nadministered half-hourly, along with itraconazole (1%) eye\nointment three times a day and ketoconazole (200 mg) twice\ndaily. She was once again lost to follow-up and presented\nintermittently over the next 5 months with scleral involvement,\neither active scleritis or involvement with ocular congestion.\nThroughout the follow-up period, her vision in the right eye\ncontinued to be perception of light. The graft continued to be\nedematous.\nHer compliance continued to be poor. At each presentation,\nshe was placed on topical and systemic antifungals as well as\ntopical and systemic nonsteroid anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs. Ther-\napy always provided symptomatic relief as well as resolution of\nsigns of scleritis. She was last seen 9 months after the initial\npresentation.

The case isolate was sub-\ncultured on Czapek Dox yeast extract and malt extract agar\nplates for morphological identi\ufb01cation. The fungus was\nidenti\ufb01ed as Aspergillus species from section Flavi based on\ncolony morphology and microscopic features of the isolate\n(Fig. 1). Colony surface on Czapek Dox yeast extract was\nvelvety to \ufb02occose, consisting of white or light orange-brown\nvegetative mycelium and sparse to moderately abundant\nconidial structures. Colony reverse was light yellow or or-\nange-brown. Sclerotia could not be observed. Conidio-\nphores were variable in length (600 to 1,500 mm), uncol-\nored,\nand\nechinulate\n(Fig.\n1A).\nConidial\nheads\nwere\nyellowish green, biseriate, and radiate, often splitting into\nseveral columns. Vesicles were globose to subglobose, 45 to\n65 \u0003m in diameter. Conidia were globose to subglobose,\nechinulate, and 4 to 6 \u0003m in diameter (Fig. 1B). Living\ncultures were deposited at the Department of Microbiology,\nAravind\nEye\nHospital\nand\nPostgraduate\nInstitute\nof\nOphthalmology, Coimbatore, India (strain number: 823/07),\nand at the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS\n123901).\nFor the purposes of molecular identi\ufb01cation, mycelia\ngrown in liquid YPG medium (0.5% Bacto yeast extract,\n0.5% Bacto peptone, 1% glucose) for 1 day were subjected\nto DNA isolation by the Masterpure yeast DNA puri\ufb01cation\nkit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) region of the rRNA gene complex, incorporat-\ning ITS1, the 5.8S rRNA gene, and ITS2, was ampli\ufb01ed\nusing primers ITS1 and ITS4 (31). Part of the calmodulin\ngene was ampli\ufb01ed using the primers cmd5 and cmd6 as\ndescribed by Hong et al. (12), while a segment of the \u0004-tu-\nbulin gene was ampli\ufb01ed using primers bT2a and bT2b (10).\nDNA sequences were determined using a BigDye Termina-\ntor v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Fos-\nter City, CA) and an ABI 3100 DNA sequencer. Sequence\nanalysis was carried out by BLASTN similarity search at the\nwebsite of the National Center for Biotechnology Informa-\ntion (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) (2). Molecular\nidenti\ufb01cation based on sequence analysis of ITS, \u0004-tubulin,\nand calmodulin sequences revealed that the isolate belongs\nto the species Aspergillus nomius.\nAntifungal susceptibility testing. The Etest method (AB\nBiodisk, Solna, Sweden) for molds was used to determine the\nMICs of the isolate to amphotericin B, \ufb02uconazole, itracon-\nazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin. In accor-\ndance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, RPMI 1640 agar\n(15 g in 1,000 ml) supplemented with 20 g glucose per 1,000 ml\nmedium was used in the tests (1). The MICs of natamycin\n(Natamet; 5% suspension; Sun Pharmaceutical Ind. Ltd., Halol,\nIndia), econazole (Aurozole; 2% suspension; Aurolab, Madu-\nrai, India), and clotrimazole (Auroclot; 1% suspension; Auro-\nlab, Madurai, India) were determined by the broth microdilu-\ntion technique NCCLS M38-A (22). Both the Etest and\nmicrodilution plates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 72 h. Candida\nparapsilosis ATCC 22019 was used as the quality control for\neconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and amphotericin B\nduring the susceptibility tests.

A recent\npaper reported a corneal ulcer due to Aspergillus tamarii (15),\nsuggesting that members of Aspergillus section Flavi other than\nA. \ufb02avus may also be potential causative agents of mycotic\nkeratitis.\nAspergillus nomius Kurtzman, Horn & Hesseltine is morpho-\nlogically a highly variable species which is dif\ufb01cult to classify by\nconventional criteria (8, 17). Isolates of this species can pro-\nduce variously sized sclerotia including the originally described\nindeterminate ones considered characteristic of this species\n(18), as well as S-type sclerotia (6).\nAs an a\ufb02atoxin-producing member of Aspergillus section\nFlavi, A. nomius can convert sterigmatocystin to a\ufb02atoxin.\nWhile A. \ufb02avus normally produces only B-type a\ufb02atoxins, A.\nnomius is able to produce both series B (B1 and B2) and G (G1\nand G2) a\ufb02atoxins, similarly to Aspergillus parasiticus (5). A\nrecent study of soil samples from Thailand demonstrated that\nA. nomius is more widespread than may be commonly thought;\nit can be the predominant a\ufb02atoxin-producing Aspergillus spe-\ncies at certain geographic locations and must be considered a\npotential etiological agent of a\ufb02atoxin contamination events\ndue to its ability to produce large quantities of a\ufb02atoxins (6).\nA. nomius can be distinguished from other members of As-\npergillus section Flavi by a number of molecular techniques (3,\n4, 7, 8, 16\u201318, 20, 21, 30), including sequence analysis of the\nITS regions (6, 27), as was done in this study. It was hypothe-\nsized that A. nomius diverged from a common ancestor prior to\nthe divergence of A. \ufb02avus (5, 7). Phylogenetic analyses based\non coding sequences of the a\ufb02atoxin pathway regulatory gene\na\ufb02R and the a\ufb02J-a\ufb02R intergenic sequence suggested that A.\nnomius is a diverse paraphyletic assemblage likely to contain\nseveral species (7).\nA. nomius shows a cosmopolitan distribution (4, 6, 7, 9, 13,\n14, 16\u201318, 23, 25, 26, 28), including previous isolation from red\nsoil in India (20); thus, the mud falling into the eye of the\npatient can be considered the possible source of the infection.\nThe fact that the patient missed scheduled postoperative fol-\nlow-up visits possibly contributed to the complications. It is\nuncertain whether the repeated episodes of scleral involve-\nment were due to the spread of infection from the involved\nareas as noted during surgery or to recurrence of infection due\nto poor compliance. However, since this is the \ufb01rst such re-\nported case of A. nomius infection, all possibilities remain\nhypothetical.\nTo our knowledge, the presented case of fungal keratitis is\nthe \ufb01rst report on an ocular infection caused by A. nomius and,\nfurthermore, the \ufb01rst known case of human disease with the\ninvolvement of this species from Aspergillus section Flavi.\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The GenBank ac-\ncession numbers for the sequences of the case isolate are\nGQ221261 (ITS), GQ221262 (\u0004-tubulin), and GQ221263 (cal-\nmodulin).\nThis work was supported by the Indian National Science Acad-\nemy and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences within the frames of\nthe Indo-Hungarian bilateral exchange program No.IA/INSA-HAS\nProject/2007 and by the intergovernmental project DST-Te\n\u00b4T OMFB-\n00285/2008.

Ocular injury was known as\na predisposing factor. The patient was treated with natamycin and econazole eye drops, itraconazole eye\nointment, and oral ketoconazole. A therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty was performed 16 days after presen-\ntation. A sequence-based approach was used to assign the isolate to a species.\nCASE REPORT\nA 64-year-old woman with no signi\ufb01cant ophthalmic or sys-\ntemic history presented with a history of pain, redness, and\ndefective vision of the right eye of 4 days\u2019 duration following a\nminor trauma sustained by mud splashing into the eye. She had\nbeen treated elsewhere earlier, and her medications consisted\nof the use of tobramycin, phenylephrine, natamycin, and moxi-\n\ufb02oxacin eye drops for 1 day.\nOn examination, her uncorrected visual acuity was less than\n20/800 (\u00021/60) in the right eye. Slit lamp examination of the\nright eye was signi\ufb01cant for an area of in\ufb01ltration (6.2 to 7.5\nmm) involving the central cornea and extending toward the\nlimbus temporally and superiorly. The in\ufb01ltrate involved all the\nlayers of the stroma, and there was a dense endothelial plaque.\nA hypopyon of 1 mm was present. Scrapings obtained from the\ncorneal in\ufb01ltrate were stained (Gram\u2019s stain and 10% KOH)\nand plated on 5% sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and potato\ndextrose agar. Both the Gram stain and the KOH mounts were\npositive for fungal \ufb01laments, and the cultures subsequently\ngrew a fungus which was initially identi\ufb01ed as a member of\nAspergillus section Flavi.\nGiven the severity of the infection, the patient was admitted\nto the hospital, and intensive topical antifungal therapy was\ninitiated. Natamycin (5%) and econazole (2%) eye drops were\nstarted on a half-hourly basis, while itraconazole (1%) eye\nointment was applied three times a day. This was supple-\nmented with cycloplegics (homatropine) and medication for\nthe relief of pain. Oral antifungal medication in the form of\ntablets (200 mg ketoconazole twice a day) was also given. 1n spite of intensive therapy, the in\ufb01ltrate continued to\nprogress with thiming and melting of the cornea. Doxycy-\ncline tablets were administered to decrease the collageno-\nlytic activity, and amphotericin B (50 \u0003g/ml) eye drops were\nalso added to the medical regimen, but the in\ufb01ltrate con-\ntinued to progress to involve the entire cornea with descem-\netocele formation and \ufb01nally perforation. A therapeutic\npenetrating keratoplasty was performed 16 days after pre-\nsentation. Scleral extension was noted intraoperatively at\nthe superior limbus. The corneal button removed at the time\nof surgery was also positive for a heavy growth of Aspergillus.\nPostoperatively the same medical regimen was continued in\na tapering fashion, and the patient was discharged on the\n10th postoperative day. After an interval of 35 days postop-\neratively, she once again presented with an area of in\ufb01ltra-\ntion at 11 o\u2019clock of the superior sclera; this was treated\nsuccessfully medically, and the in\ufb01ltrate healed in a week.\nShe was asked to continue natamycin and econazole (2%)\nfour times a day along with itraconazole (1%) eye ointment\nthree times and homatropine (2%) eye drops twice a day.\nThe patient was lost to follow-up until 40 days later, when\nshe presented with pain and redness. Examination was remark-\nable for the presence of a tender nodule involving an area of\nthe sclera from 7 o\u2019clock to 9 o\u2019clock. The patient was once\nagain placed on intensive antifungal therapy with amphotericin\nB (50 \u0003g/ml) eye drops and econazole (2%) eye drops being\nadministered half-hourly, along with itraconazole (1%) eye\nointment three times a day and ketoconazole (200 mg) twice\ndaily. She was once again lost to follow-up and presented\nintermittently over the next 5 months with scleral involvement,\neither active scleritis or involvement with ocular congestion.\nThroughout the follow-up period, her vision in the right eye\ncontinued to be perception of light.

The case isolate was sub-\ncultured on Czapek Dox yeast extract and malt extract agar\nplates for morphological identi\ufb01cation. The fungus was\nidenti\ufb01ed as Aspergillus species from section Flavi based on\ncolony morphology and microscopic features of the isolate\n(Fig. 1). Colony surface on Czapek Dox yeast extract was\nvelvety to \ufb02occose, consisting of white or light orange-brown\nvegetative mycelium and sparse to moderately abundant\nconidial structures. Colony reverse was light yellow or or-\nange-brown. Sclerotia could not be observed. Conidio-\nphores were variable in length (600 to 1,500 mm), uncol-\nored,\nand\nechinulate\n(Fig.\n1A).\nConidial\nheads\nwere\nyellowish green, biseriate, and radiate, often splitting into\nseveral columns. Vesicles were globose to subglobose, 45 to\n65 \u0003m in diameter. Conidia were globose to subglobose,\nechinulate, and 4 to 6 \u0003m in diameter (Fig. 1B). Living\ncultures were deposited at the Department of Microbiology,\nAravind\nEye\nHospital\nand\nPostgraduate 1nstitute\nof\nOphthalmology, Coimbatore, 1ndia (strain number: 823/07),\nand at the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS\n123901).\nFor the purposes of molecular identi\ufb01cation, mycelia\ngrown in liquid YPG medium (0.5% Bacto yeast extract,\n0.5% Bacto peptone, 1% glucose) for 1 day were subjected\nto DNA isolation by the Masterpure yeast DNA puri\ufb01cation\nkit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) region of the rRNA gene complex, incorporat-\ning 1TS1, the 5.8S rRNA gene, and 1TS2, was ampli\ufb01ed\nusing primers 1TS1 and 1TS4 (31). Part of the calmodulin\ngene was ampli\ufb01ed using the primers cmd5 and cmd6 as\ndescribed by Hong et al. (12), while a segment of the \u0004-tu-\nbulin gene was ampli\ufb01ed using primers bT2a and bT2b (10).\nDNA sequences were determined using a BigDye Termina-\ntor v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems 1nc., Fos-\nter City, CA) and an ABI 3100 DNA sequencer. Sequence\nanalysis was carried out by BLASTN similarity search at the\nwebsite of the National Center for Biotechnology 1nforma-\ntion (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) (2). Molecular\nidenti\ufb01cation based on sequence analysis of 1TS, \u0004-tubulin,\nand calmodulin sequences revealed that the isolate belongs\nto the species Aspergillus nomius.\nAntifungal susceptibility testing. The Etest method (AB\nBiodisk, Solna, Sweden) for molds was used to determine the\nMICs of the isolate to amphotericin B, \ufb02uconazole, itracon-\nazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin. 1n accor-\ndance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, RPMI 1640 agar\n(15 g in 1,000 ml) supplemented with 20 g glucose per 1,000 ml\nmedium was used in the tests (1). The MICs of natamycin\n(Natamet; 5% suspension; Sun Pharmaceutical 1nd. Ltd., Halol, 1ndia), econazole (Aurozole; 2% suspension; Aurolab, Madu-\nrai, 1ndia), and clotrimazole (Auroclot; 1% suspension; Auro-\nlab, Madurai, 1ndia) were determined by the broth microdilu-\ntion technique NCCLS M38-A (22). Both the Etest and\nmicrodilution plates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 72 h. Candida\nparapsilosis ATCC 22019 was used as the quality control for\neconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and amphotericin B\nduring the susceptibility tests.

A recent\npaper reported a corneal ulcer due to Aspergillus tamarii (15),\nsuggesting that members of Aspergillus section Flavi other than\nA. \ufb02avus may also be potential causative agents of mycotic\nkeratitis.\nAspergillus nomius Kurtzman, Horn & Hesseltine is morpho-\nlogically a highly variable species which is dif\ufb01cult to classify by\nconventional criteria (8, 17). 1solates of this species can pro-\nduce variously sized sclerotia including the originally described\nindeterminate ones considered characteristic of this species\n(18), as well as S-type sclerotia (6).\nAs an a\ufb02atoxin-producing member of Aspergillus section\nFlavi, A. nomius can convert sterigmatocystin to a\ufb02atoxin.\nWhile A. \ufb02avus normally produces only B-type a\ufb02atoxins, A.\nnomius is able to produce both series B (B1 and B2) and G (G1\nand G2) a\ufb02atoxins, similarly to Aspergillus parasiticus (5). A\nrecent study of soil samples from Thailand demonstrated that\nA. nomius is more widespread than may be commonly thought;\nit can be the predominant a\ufb02atoxin-producing Aspergillus spe-\ncies at certain geographic locations and must be considered a\npotential etiological agent of a\ufb02atoxin contamination events\ndue to its ability to produce large quantities of a\ufb02atoxins (6).\nA. nomius can be distinguished from other members of As-\npergillus section Flavi by a number of molecular techniques (3,\n4, 7, 8, 16\u201318, 20, 21, 30), including sequence analysis of the 1TS regions (6, 27), as was done in this study. 1t was hypothe-\nsized that A. nomius diverged from a common ancestor prior to\nthe divergence of A. \ufb02avus (5, 7). Phylogenetic analyses based\non coding sequences of the a\ufb02atoxin pathway regulatory gene\na\ufb02R and the a\ufb02J-a\ufb02R intergenic sequence suggested that A.\nnomius is a diverse paraphyletic assemblage likely to contain\nseveral species (7).\nA. nomius shows a cosmopolitan distribution (4, 6, 7, 9, 13,\n14, 16\u201318, 23, 25, 26, 28), including previous isolation from red\nsoil in 1ndia (20); thus, the mud falling into the eye of the\npatient can be considered the possible source of the infection.\nThe fact that the patient missed scheduled postoperative fol-\nlow-up visits possibly contributed to the complications. 1t is\nuncertain whether the repeated episodes of scleral involve-\nment were due to the spread of infection from the involved\nareas as noted during surgery or to recurrence of infection due\nto poor compliance. However, since this is the \ufb01rst such re-\nported case of A. nomius infection, all possibilities remain\nhypothetical.\nTo our knowledge, the presented case of fungal keratitis is\nthe \ufb01rst report on an ocular infection caused by A. nomius and,\nfurthermore, the \ufb01rst known case of human disease with the\ninvolvement of this species from Aspergillus section Flavi.\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The GenBank ac-\ncession numbers for the sequences of the case isolate are\nGQ221261 (ITS), GQ221262 (\u0004-tubulin), and GQ221263 (cal-\nmodulin).\nThis work was supported by the 1ndian National Science Acad-\nemy and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences within the frames of\nthe 1ndo-Hungarian bilateral exchange program No.IA/INSA-HAS\nProject/2007 and by the intergovernmental project DST-Te\n\u00b4T OMFB-\n00285/2008.

Strain Y-11\nNAOKI 1KEGUCHI, TAKUYA NIHIRA, ATSUKO KISHIMOTO, AND YASUHIRO YAMADA*\nDepartment of Fermentation Technology, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita-shi,\nOsaka 565, Japan\nReceived 5 June 1987/Accepted 5 November 1987\nThe reaction pathway from squalene to trans-geranylacetone in Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11 was studied. The\nenzyme or enzymes catalyzing squalene degradation were found to be membrane bound. Stoichiometric\nanalysis of a cell-free system revealed that the ratio of squalene to trans-geranylacetone changed from 1:2 to 1:1\nas the reaction proceeded, indicating two steps in geranylacetone formation. The initial step was found to be\noxygenase catalyzed, from the absolute requirement for molecular oxygen in geranylacetone formation and the\nincorporation of 180 into geranylacetone under 1802 atmosphere. By using [3H]squalene as the substrate, we\ndetected an intermediate in the pathway and identified it as 5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-trienoic acid by\nmass spectrometry, infrared spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, and chemical synthesis.\nWe deduced that squalene was first oxidatively cleaved to geranylacetone and the intermediate, and that the\nintermediate was further metabolized to geranylacetone. We also synthesized some of the presumptive\nmetabolites, such as 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-4,8,12-trien-2-one, and confirmed that they served as active\nprecursors for geranylacetone formation. Based on these lines of evidence, we present here the pathway from\nsqualene to trans-geranylacetone in Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11.\nSqualene is a naturally abundant acyclic triterpene and is\na common intermediate in the formation of steroids and\ntriterpenes. 1n investigating the microbial transformation of\nsqualene, we isolated Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11 (7, 8),\nCorynebacterium sp. strain S-401 (3, 4), and Corynebacte-\nrium sp. strain SY-79 (5, 9, 10). Corynebacterium sp. strain\nSY-79 oxidizes the terminal carbon of squalene, forming C30\ndicarboxylic acid, and Corynebacterium sp. strain S-401\nhydrates the double bonds of squalene; but Arthrobacter sp.\nstrain Y-11 is unique in that it oxidatively cleaves the central\npart of the squalene molecule regioselectively to form two\nmolecules of trans-geranylacetone.\nSince the squalene molecule is linear and symmetrical,\nhaving six almost equivalent double bonds, this regioselec-\ntive reaction pathway attracted our attention. 1n the present\nstudy, we examined the reaction pathway from squalene to\ngeranylacetone by using a cell-free system of Arthrobacter\nsp. strain Y-11. We found that one molecule of geranylace-\ntone was formed directly by an oxygenase, leaving a C14 unit\nthat was further metabolized via several steps to form\nanother molecule of geranylacetone.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStrain. Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11, isolated from soil (8),\nwas used throughout this study.\nChemicals. 1802 (99 atom%) and H2180 (70 atom%) were\nobtained from Amersham 1nternational, Amersham, United\nKingdom.

A pellet suspension (0.1 ml) in\n0.25 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing [4,8,12,13,\n17,21-3H]squalene (1 ,uCi) was incubated for 2 h at 35\u00b0C,\ndiluted with 0.9 ml of water, and extracted three times with\n1-ml portions of ethyl acetate. After evaporation of the ethyl\nacetate layer, the residue was developed on a silica gel plate\n(Kiselgel 60 F254; E. Merck AG, Darmstadt, Federal Repub-\nlic of Germany) with hexane-ether (8:2,\nvol/vol)\nas the\nsolvent. Radioactive material on the plate was detected by\nfluorography with 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 2-methylnaph-\nthalene\n(2) for 65 h\nat -80\u00b0C.\nAuthentic squalene and\ngeranylacetone were spotted on a separate plate and treated\nsimilarly, except that potassium permanganate was used for\ndetection.\nReaction with 1802 in the cell-free system. A pellet suspen-\nsion (1.0 ml) in 0.25 M potassium phosphate containing 1\nmM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 ml of squalene was placed\nin a test tube fitted with an airtight septum. After complete\nremoval of air by vacuum pump, the test tube was filled with\n40% 1802 (99 atom%) in N2. After standing for 48 h at 35\u00b0C,\nthe reaction mixture was extracted four times with dichlo-\nromethane, and the dichloromethane layer was dried over\nanhydrous sodium sulfate. After evaporation of the solvent,\ngeranylacetone in the residue was purified by high-perfor-\nmance liquid chromatography with hexane-ether (8:2) as the\neluting solvent.\nSynthesis of ethyl 3-oxo-5,9,13,-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-\ntrienoate. Ethyl 4-diethylphosphono-3-oxobutanoate (4.8 g),\nprepared from ethyl 4-bromoacetoacetate (6) and diethyl-\nphosphite by the method of Bodalski et al. (1), was dissolved\nin 40 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran. This was added in portions\nto a suspension of NaH (1.8 g in 60 ml of dry tetrahydrofu-\nran) at 25\u00b0C with stirring under nitrogen gas over a period of\n10 min. After 30 min of stirring, geranylacetone (3.5 g in 20\nml of dry tetrahydrofuran) was added in portions to the\nmixture, which was then allowed to react for 5 h at 38\u00b0C. The\nsolution was poured into 100 ml of cold 1 N HCl, and the\nmixture was extracted twice with 200-ml portions of ethyl\nacetate. The ethyl acetate layer was washed three times with\nwater and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation\nof the solvent gave 7.54 g of oily residue, which was further\npurified by column chromatography on 130 g of silica gel\nwith hexane-ethyl acetate (98:2).

The resulting solid was dissolved in boiling\nchloroform-ethanol\n(20:1),\nprecipitated\nwith\nether,\nand\ndried. The phosphonium salt (3 g) was added over a period of\n2 min to 1.4 g of sodium hydride in 40 ml of dry tetrahydro-\nfuran under nitrogen gas at 4\u00b0C. After the preparation was\nstirred for 1.5 h at 50\u00b0C, geranylacetone (2.1 ml) was added\nat 25\u00b0C to the mixture, which was then stirred for 48 h at\n40\u00b0C. The solution was diluted with water, acidified to pH 3\nwith 30% phosphoric acid, and extracted with ethyl acetate,\nand the ethyl acetate extract was dried over anhydrous\nsodium sulfate.

The ether extract\nwas washed three times with water, dried over anhydrous\nmagnesium\nsulfate, and evaporated\nto dryness, yielding\n150 mg of 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-4,8,12-trien-2-one (89%).\nOther analytical data were as follows: mass spectrum, mle\n234 (M+); infrared spectrum vmax/cm-1, 2,963, 2,917, 2,868,\n1,719, 1,691, 1,619, 1,448, 1,382, 1,362; NMR spectrum in\nCDC13 8 ppm, 1.62 to 1.68 (12H, singlet, C=C-CH2), 2.00 to\n2.37 (1SH, O=C-CH3 and methylene protons), 5.09 (2H,\n-C=C-H), 6.05 (1H, C=CH-C=O).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWhen cells of Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11 were disrupted\nby sonication, all of the squalene-oxidizing activity (76% of\nthat in resting cells) was found in the pellet fraction, and\nnone was found in the supernatant. This phenomenon was\nalso observed when cells were disrupted with a French press\nor Braun homogenizer or when cells grown to a different\nphase or on different media were used.\nAll attempts to\nsolubilize the activity were unsuccessful, indicating that the\nenzyme or enzymes responsible were tightly bound to the\ncell membrane. Therefore, we used the pellet suspension as\nthe cell-free enzyme for further study.\nTime course study of squalene degradation by the pellet\nsuspension (Fig. 1) revealed that the stoichiometry between\nsqualene and geranylacetone changed after 9 h of reaction.\nUntil 9 h, the ratio of squalene to geranylacetone was 1:1.8,\nbut thereafter\nit changed to 1:0.8. This result can be ex-\nplained by assuming two routes for geranylacetone forma-\ntion, one less stable than the other.\nTo learn more about these routes, we investigated the\neffect of substrate concentration on geranylacetone forma-\ntion (Fig. 2). As substrates we considered both squalene and\nmolecular oxygen, because an oxygen atom should be incor-\nporated into the squalene molecule during its conversion to\ngeranylacetone, and molecular oxygen might be a substrate.\nGeranylacetone formation showed a simple hyperbolic de-\npendence on squalene concentration, with a Km of 15.9 mM.\nFurthermore, an absolute requirement for molecular oxygen\nwas demonstrated (Fig. 2B), indicating that the two routes\nshared initial reaction(s) catalyzed by an oxygenase.

The reaction was performed with the pellet suspension at 35\u00b0C\nfor the indicated period.\nwe performed the enzyme reaction under an atmosphere of\n40% 180260% N2 and analyzed the geranylacetone formed\nby mass spectrometry (Fig. 3).

Actually, when the reaction was performed under air\nwith 40% H2180-60% H2160 instead of normal water, the\nratio between [180]geranylacetone and [160]geranylacetone\nwas 0.19:0.81, which agreed well with the expected incor-\nporation of 20%.\n1602\n160\n170\n180\n190\n200\nmWe\n1802\n160\n170\n180\n190\n200\nmie\nFIG. 3.

By fluorography, we detected two polar com-\npounds (compounds 3 and 4) other than geranylacetone (Rs\nof squalene, geranylacetone, and compounds 3 and 4 were\n0.93, 0.57, 0.09, and 0.04, respectively, with hexane-ether\n[8:2] as the solvent). To obtain enough of compounds 3 and\n4 to identify their structure, we incubated 26 g of squalene\nwith 500 ml of the pellet suspension in 0.25 M potassium\nphosphate containing 1 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2 for 12 h\nat 35\u00b0C.\nExtraction of the reaction mixture with ethyl\nacetate, drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evapo-\nration of the solvent gave 25.6 g of oily product. This oil was\npartitioned between hexane and methanol-water (9:1). Non-\npolar compounds, such as the remaining squalene, were\nalmost totally removed into the hexane layer. Evaporation of\nthe methanol-water layer gave 1.28 g of oil material, and this\nwas fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatogra-\nphy with hexane-ether (8:2) as the solvent system (flow rate,\n2 mllmin; detection at 220 nm). Two products, compounds 3\nand 4, were obtained (about 50 mg of each; retention times of\nsqualene, geranylacetone, and compounds 3 and 4 were\n14.8, 22.7, 26.7, and 28.5 min, respectively).\nThe analytical data for compound 3 were as follows:\ninfrared spectrum (film) vmax/cm-1, 3,400 to 2,400 (COOH),\n1,700 (C=O), 1,640 (C=C); 'H-NMR spectrum in CDCl3 8\nppm, 7.7 (1H, broad, COOH), 5.1 (2H, t, =CH), 2.4 to 2.1\n(2H, m, CH2C=O), 2.1 to 1.9 (6H, m, =C-CH2), 1.63 (3H, s,\n=C-CH3), 1.59 (6H, s, =C-CH3), 1.5 to 1.2 (2H, m, CH2),\n0.98 (3H, d, CH-CH3).

The mass spectrum of the compound 4\nmethyl ester was mle 278 (M+), 263, 235, 194.\nThe infrared spectra of compounds 3 and 4 indicated that\nthey both have a carboxyl group and some double bonds.\nThe 'H-NMR spectrum of compound 3 indicated that it has\nthree olefinic methyl groups, one with trans geometrical\nisomerism. The doublet methyl protons appearing at 0.98\nppm revealed one reduced double bond in the molecule, and\nits location was deduced from the signals of olefinic protons\nand methylene protons. The 1H-NMR spectrum of com-\npound 4 revealed four olefinic methyl groups. Considering\nthat compounds 3 and 4 were derived from squalene, we\nidentified\ntheir\nstructure\nas\n3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-6,10-\ndienoic\nacid and 5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-trienoic\nacid, respectively, based on their spectral data. The struc-\nture of compound 4 was also confirmed by the agreement\nwith chemically synthesized compound 4 in all aspects of\ninfrared and NMR data.\nCompound 4 acted as a precursor for geranylacetone\nsynthesis, whereas compound 3 did not (Table 1). Therefore,\nwe assumed that compound 4 was a true precursor and that\ncompound 3 was an offshoot product from compound 4.\nBased on these lines of evidence, we postulated the pathway\nfrom squalene to geranylacetone in Arthrobacter sp. strain\nY-11 shown in Fig. 4. Hence, squalene is oxidatively cleaved\ninto geranylacetone and acyclic aldehyde (compound 7),\nprobably by a kind of dioxygenase; compound 7 is oxidized\nto compound 4, which we isolated from the reaction product;\nand compound 4 is further oxidized at C-3 to form 3-oxo-\ntrienoic acid (compound 5) or spontaneously cleaved to\ntrienoic ketone (compound 6). Either compound 5 or 6 is\nattacked by water, followed by retroaldol-type cleavage to\nyield another geranylacetone (compound 2').\n6HH\nor\n5\n'\n6\nHSQ\nH~~~~~~~~\nor\ni\n+\nH\n2\n7\nA J\nk\nJOH '-\nOHOH\n3\n4\nFIG. 4.

The\nenzyme or enzymes catalyzing squalene degradation were found to be membrane bound. Stoichiometric\nanalysis of a cell-free system revealed that the ratio of squalene to trans-geranylacetone changed from 1:2 to 1:1\nas the reaction proceeded, indicating two steps in geranylacetone formation. The initial step was found to be\noxygenase catalyzed, from the absolute requirement for molecular oxygen in geranylacetone formation and the\nincorporation of 180 into geranylacetone under 1802 atmosphere. By using [3H]squalene as the substrate, we\ndetected an intermediate in the pathway and identified it as 5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-trienoic acid by\nmass spectrometry, infrared spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, and chemical synthesis.\nWe deduced that squalene was first oxidatively cleaved to geranylacetone and the intermediate, and that the\nintermediate was further metabolized to geranylacetone. We also synthesized some of the presumptive\nmetabolites, such as 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-4,8,12-trien-2-one, and confirmed that they served as active\nprecursors for geranylacetone formation. Based on these lines of evidence, we present here the pathway from\nsqualene to trans-geranylacetone in Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11.\nSqualene is a naturally abundant acyclic triterpene and is\na common intermediate in the formation of steroids and\ntriterpenes. In investigating the microbial transformation of\nsqualene, we isolated Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11 (7, 8),\nCorynebacterium sp. strain S-401 (3, 4), and Corynebacte-\nrium sp. strain SY-79 (5, 9, 10). Corynebacterium sp. strain\nSY-79 oxidizes the terminal carbon of squalene, forming C30\ndicarboxylic acid, and Corynebacterium sp. strain S-401\nhydrates the double bonds of squalene; but Arthrobacter sp.\nstrain Y-11 is unique in that it oxidatively cleaves the central\npart of the squalene molecule regioselectively to form two\nmolecules of trans-geranylacetone.\nSince the squalene molecule is linear and symmetrical,\nhaving six almost equivalent double bonds, this regioselec-\ntive reaction pathway attracted our attention. In the present\nstudy, we examined the reaction pathway from squalene to\ngeranylacetone by using a cell-free system of Arthrobacter\nsp. strain Y-11. We found that one molecule of geranylace-\ntone was formed directly by an oxygenase, leaving a C14 unit\nthat was further metabolized via several steps to form\nanother molecule of geranylacetone.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStrain.

A pellet suspension (0.1 ml) in\n0.25 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing [4,8,12,13,\n17,21-3H]squalene (1 ,uCi) was incubated for 2 h at 35\u00b0C,\ndiluted with 0.9 ml of water, and extracted three times with\n1-ml portions of ethyl acetate. After evaporation of the ethyl\nacetate layer, the residue was developed on a silica gel plate\n(Kiselgel 60 F254; E. Merck AG, Darmstadt, Federal Repub-\nlic of Germany) with hexane-ether (8:2,\nvol/vol)\nas the\nsolvent. Radioactive material on the plate was detected by\nfluorography with 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 2-methylnaph-\nthalene\n(2) for 65 h\nat -80\u00b0C.\nAuthentic squalene and\ngeranylacetone were spotted on a separate plate and treated\nsimilarly, except that potassium permanganate was used for\ndetection.\nReaction with 1802 in the cell-free system. A pellet suspen-\nsion (1.0 ml) in 0.25 M potassium phosphate containing 1\nmM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 ml of squalene was placed\nin a test tube fitted with an airtight septum. After complete\nremoval of air by vacuum pump, the test tube was filled with\n40% 1802 (99 atom%) in N2. After standing for 48 h at 35\u00b0C,\nthe reaction mixture was extracted four times with dichlo-\nromethane, and the dichloromethane layer was dried over\nanhydrous sodium sulfate. After evaporation of the solvent,\ngeranylacetone in the residue was purified by high-perfor-\nmance liquid chromatography with hexane-ether (8:2) as the\neluting solvent.\nSynthesis of ethyl 3-oxo-5,9,13,-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-\ntrienoate. Ethyl 4-diethylphosphono-3-oxobutanoate (4.8 g),\nprepared from ethyl 4-bromoacetoacetate (6) and diethyl-\nphosphite by the method of Bodalski et al. (1), was dissolved\nin 40 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran. This was added in portions\nto a suspension of NaH (1.8 g in 60 ml of dry tetrahydrofu-\nran) at 25\u00b0C with stirring under nitrogen gas over a period of\n10 min. After 30 min of stirring, geranylacetone (3.5 g in 20\nml of dry tetrahydrofuran) was added in portions to the\nmixture, which was then allowed to react for 5 h at 38\u00b0C. The\nsolution was poured into 100 ml of cold 1 N HCl, and the\nmixture was extracted twice with 200-ml portions of ethyl\nacetate. The ethyl acetate layer was washed three times with\nwater and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation\nof the solvent gave 7.54 g of oily residue, which was further\npurified by column chromatography on 130 g of silica gel\nwith hexane-ethyl acetate (98:2).

The resulting solid was dissolved in boiling\nchloroform-ethanol\n(20:1),\nprecipitated\nwith\nether,\nand\ndried. The phosphonium salt (3 g) was added over a period of\n2 min to 1.4 g of sodium hydride in 40 ml of dry tetrahydro-\nfuran under nitrogen gas at 4\u00b0C. After the preparation was\nstirred for 1.5 h at 50\u00b0C, geranylacetone (2.1 ml) was added\nat 25\u00b0C to the mixture, which was then stirred for 48 h at\n40\u00b0C. The solution was diluted with water, acidified to pH 3\nwith 30% phosphoric acid, and extracted with ethyl acetate,\nand the ethyl acetate extract was dried over anhydrous\nsodium sulfate. Removal of solvent yielded 4.5 g of crude\noily material, and the crude material was purified by silica\ngel chromatography with hexane-ether-acetic acid (9:1:0.01)\nas the eluent.

The ether extract\nwas washed three times with water, dried over anhydrous\nmagnesium\nsulfate, and evaporated\nto dryness, yielding\n150 mg of 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-4,8,12-trien-2-one (89%).\nOther analytical data were as follows: mass spectrum, mle\n234 (M+); infrared spectrum vmax/cm-1, 2,963, 2,917, 2,868,\n1,719, 1,691, 1,619, 1,448, 1,382, 1,362; NMR spectrum in\nCDC13 8 ppm, 1.62 to 1.68 (12H, singlet, C=C-CH2), 2.00 to\n2.37 (1SH, O=C-CH3 and methylene protons), 5.09 (2H,\n-C=C-H), 6.05 (1H, C=CH-C=O).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWhen cells of Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11 were disrupted\nby sonication, all of the squalene-oxidizing activity (76% of\nthat in resting cells) was found in the pellet fraction, and\nnone was found in the supernatant. This phenomenon was\nalso observed when cells were disrupted with a French press\nor Braun homogenizer or when cells grown to a different\nphase or on different media were used.\nAll attempts to\nsolubilize the activity were unsuccessful, indicating that the\nenzyme or enzymes responsible were tightly bound to the\ncell membrane. Therefore, we used the pellet suspension as\nthe cell-free enzyme for further study.\nTime course study of squalene degradation by the pellet\nsuspension (Fig. 1) revealed that the stoichiometry between\nsqualene and geranylacetone changed after 9 h of reaction.\nUntil 9 h, the ratio of squalene to geranylacetone was 1:1.8,\nbut thereafter\nit changed to 1:0.8. This result can be ex-\nplained by assuming two routes for geranylacetone forma-\ntion, one less stable than the other.\nTo learn more about these routes, we investigated the\neffect of substrate concentration on geranylacetone forma-\ntion (Fig. 2). As substrates we considered both squalene and\nmolecular oxygen, because an oxygen atom should be incor-\nporated into the squalene molecule during its conversion to\ngeranylacetone, and molecular oxygen might be a substrate.\nGeranylacetone formation showed a simple hyperbolic de-\npendence on squalene concentration, with a Km of 15.9 mM.\nFurthermore, an absolute requirement for molecular oxygen\nwas demonstrated (Fig. 2B), indicating that the two routes\nshared initial reaction(s) catalyzed by an oxygenase.

The reaction was performed with the pellet suspension at 35\u00b0C\nfor the indicated period.\nwe performed the enzyme reaction under an atmosphere of\n40% 180260% N2 and analyzed the geranylacetone formed\nby mass spectrometry (Fig. 3).

It is thus appar-\nent that part of the geranylacetone was formed by the attack\nof molecular oxygen, i.e., by an oxygenase-catalyzed reac-\ntion, whereas the rest seemed to be formed by the attack of\nwater. Actually, when the reaction was performed under air\nwith 40% H2180-60% H2160 instead of normal water, the\nratio between [180]geranylacetone and [160]geranylacetone\nwas 0.19:0.81, which agreed well with the expected incor-\nporation of 20%.\n1602\n160\n170\n180\n190\n200\nmWe\n1802\n160\n170\n180\n190\n200\nmie\nFIG. 3.

By fluorography, we detected two polar com-\npounds (compounds 3 and 4) other than geranylacetone (Rs\nof squalene, geranylacetone, and compounds 3 and 4 were\n0.93, 0.57, 0.09, and 0.04, respectively, with hexane-ether\n[8:2] as the solvent). To obtain enough of compounds 3 and\n4 to identify their structure, we incubated 26 g of squalene\nwith 500 ml of the pellet suspension in 0.25 M potassium\nphosphate containing 1 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2 for 12 h\nat 35\u00b0C.\nExtraction of the reaction mixture with ethyl\nacetate, drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evapo-\nration of the solvent gave 25.6 g of oily product. This oil was\npartitioned between hexane and methanol-water (9:1). Non-\npolar compounds, such as the remaining squalene, were\nalmost totally removed into the hexane layer. Evaporation of\nthe methanol-water layer gave 1.28 g of oil material, and this\nwas fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatogra-\nphy with hexane-ether (8:2) as the solvent system (flow rate,\n2 mllmin; detection at 220 nm).

The mass spectrum of the compound 4\nmethyl ester was mle 278 (M+), 263, 235, 194.\nThe infrared spectra of compounds 3 and 4 indicated that\nthey both have a carboxyl group and some double bonds.\nThe 'H-NMR spectrum of compound 3 indicated that it has\nthree olefinic methyl groups, one with trans geometrical\nisomerism. The doublet methyl protons appearing at 0.98\nppm revealed one reduced double bond in the molecule, and\nits location was deduced from the signals of olefinic protons\nand methylene protons. The 1H-NMR spectrum of com-\npound 4 revealed four olefinic methyl groups. Considering\nthat compounds 3 and 4 were derived from squalene, we\nidentified\ntheir\nstructure\nas\n3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-6,10-\ndienoic\nacid and 5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-trienoic\nacid, respectively, based on their spectral data. The struc-\nture of compound 4 was also confirmed by the agreement\nwith chemically synthesized compound 4 in all aspects of\ninfrared and NMR data.\nCompound 4 acted as a precursor for geranylacetone\nsynthesis, whereas compound 3 did not (Table 1). Therefore,\nwe assumed that compound 4 was a true precursor and that\ncompound 3 was an offshoot product from compound 4.\nBased on these lines of evidence, we postulated the pathway\nfrom squalene to geranylacetone in Arthrobacter sp. strain\nY-11 shown in Fig. 4. Hence, squalene is oxidatively cleaved\ninto geranylacetone and acyclic aldehyde (compound 7),\nprobably by a kind of dioxygenase; compound 7 is oxidized\nto compound 4, which we isolated from the reaction product;\nand compound 4 is further oxidized at C-3 to form 3-oxo-\ntrienoic acid (compound 5) or spontaneously cleaved to\ntrienoic ketone (compound 6). Either compound 5 or 6 is\nattacked by water, followed by retroaldol-type cleavage to\nyield another geranylacetone (compound 2').\n6HH\nor\n5\n'\n6\nHSQ\nH~~~~~~~~\nor\ni\n+\nH\n2\n7\nA J\nk\nJOH '-\nOHOH\n3\n4\nFIG. 4.

The\nenzyme or enzymes catalyzing squalene degradation were found to be membrane bound. Stoichiometric\nanalysis of a cell-free system revealed that the ratio of squalene to trans-geranylacetone changed from 1:2 to 1:1\nas the reaction proceeded, indicating two steps in geranylacetone formation. The initial step was found to be\noxygenase catalyzed, from the absolute requirement for molecular oxygen in geranylacetone formation and the\nincorporation of 180 into geranylacetone under 1802 atmosphere. By using [3H]squalene as the substrate, we\ndetected an intermediate in the pathway and identified it as 5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-trienoic acid by\nmass spectrometry, infrared spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, and chemical synthesis.\nWe deduced that squalene was first oxidatively cleaved to geranylacetone and the intermediate, and that the\nintermediate was further metabolized to geranylacetone. We also synthesized some of the presumptive\nmetabolites, such as 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-4,8,12-trien-2-one, and confirmed that they served as active\nprecursors for geranylacetone formation. Based on these lines of evidence, we present here the pathway from\nsqualene to trans-geranylacetone in Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11.\nSqualene is a naturally abundant acyclic triterpene and is\na common intermediate in the formation of steroids and\ntriterpenes. In investigating the microbial transformation of\nsqualene, we isolated Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11 (7, 8),\nCorynebacterium sp. strain S-401 (3, 4), and Corynebacte-\nrium sp. strain SY-79 (5, 9, 10). Corynebacterium sp. strain\nSY-79 oxidizes the terminal carbon of squalene, forming C30\ndicarboxylic acid, and Corynebacterium sp. strain S-401\nhydrates the double bonds of squalene; but Arthrobacter sp.\nstrain Y-11 is unique in that it oxidatively cleaves the central\npart of the squalene molecule regioselectively to form two\nmolecules of trans-geranylacetone.\nSince the squalene molecule is linear and symmetrical,\nhaving six almost equivalent double bonds, this regioselec-\ntive reaction pathway attracted our attention. In the present\nstudy, we examined the reaction pathway from squalene to\ngeranylacetone by using a cell-free system of Arthrobacter\nsp. strain Y-11. We found that one molecule of geranylace-\ntone was formed directly by an oxygenase, leaving a C14 unit\nthat was further metabolized via several steps to form\nanother molecule of geranylacetone.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStrain.

This was incubated for\n40 h at 30\u00b0C on a reciprocating shaker (120 strokes per min),\ndiluted with an equal volume of 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, and\nstored at -80\u00b0C. The seed culture (2 ml) was inoculated into\n400 ml of medium containing 2% (wt/vol) corn steep liquor,\n0.3% (vol/vol) salad oil (Ajinomoto Co., Tokyo), and 0.03%\n(vol/vol) squalene in a 500-ml Sakaguchi flask. Flasks were\nincubated at 30\u00b0C for 65 h on a reciprocating shaker (120\nstrokes per min).

Cells were sus-\npended in 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) to give an\noptical density\nat 600 nm of 10 and then disrupted by\nsonication for 3 min at 4\u00b0C. Cell debris was collected by\ncentrifugation at 7,000 x g for 5 min, washed once with 0.25\nM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), and suspended in 0.25 M\npotassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The pellet suspension (1.0\nml) and squalene (0.2 ml) were mixed in a test tube (16.5 by\n165 mm) and incubated for 2 to 3 h at 35\u00b0C on a reciprocating\nshaker (150 strokes per min). The reaction mixture was\nacidified with 4 N HCI, mixed with 0.1 mg of pentadecane as\nan internal standard, and extracted with ethyl acetate; the\ngeranylacetone content of the ethyl acetate layer was deter-\nmined by gas chromatography.

Mass spectra were\nobtained with a Hitachi RMU-6E mass spectrometer.\nReaction with [3H]squalene. A pellet suspension (0.1 ml) in\n0.25 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing [4,8,12,13,\n17,21-3H]squalene (1 ,uCi) was incubated for 2 h at 35\u00b0C,\ndiluted with 0.9 ml of water, and extracted three times with\n1-ml portions of ethyl acetate. After evaporation of the ethyl\nacetate layer, the residue was developed on a silica gel plate\n(Kiselgel 60 F254; E. Merck AG, Darmstadt, Federal Repub-\nlic of Germany) with hexane-ether (8:2,\nvol/vol)\nas the\nsolvent. Radioactive material on the plate was detected by\nfluorography with 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 2-methylnaph-\nthalene\n(2) for 65 h\nat -80\u00b0C.\nAuthentic squalene and\ngeranylacetone were spotted on a separate plate and treated\nsimilarly, except that potassium permanganate was used for\ndetection.\nReaction with 1802 in the cell-free system. A pellet suspen-\nsion (1.0 ml) in 0.25 M potassium phosphate containing 1\nmM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 ml of squalene was placed\nin a test tube fitted with an airtight septum. After complete\nremoval of air by vacuum pump, the test tube was filled with\n40% 1802 (99 atom%) in N2. After standing for 48 h at 35\u00b0C,\nthe reaction mixture was extracted four times with dichlo-\nromethane, and the dichloromethane layer was dried over\nanhydrous sodium sulfate. After evaporation of the solvent,\ngeranylacetone in the residue was purified by high-perfor-\nmance liquid chromatography with hexane-ether (8:2) as the\neluting solvent.\nSynthesis of ethyl 3-oxo-5,9,13,-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-\ntrienoate. Ethyl 4-diethylphosphono-3-oxobutanoate (4.8 g),\nprepared from ethyl 4-bromoacetoacetate (6) and diethyl-\nphosphite by the method of Bodalski et al. (1), was dissolved\nin 40 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran. This was added in portions\nto a suspension of NaH (1.8 g in 60 ml of dry tetrahydrofu-\nran) at 25\u00b0C with stirring under nitrogen gas over a period of\n10 min. After 30 min of stirring, geranylacetone (3.5 g in 20\nml of dry tetrahydrofuran) was added in portions to the\nmixture, which was then allowed to react for 5 h at 38\u00b0C. The\nsolution was poured into 100 ml of cold 1 N HCl, and the\nmixture was extracted twice with 200-ml portions of ethyl\nacetate. The ethyl acetate layer was washed three times with\nwater and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation\nof the solvent gave 7.54 g of oily residue, which was further\npurified by column chromatography on 130 g of silica gel\nwith hexane-ethyl acetate (98:2). The analytical data were as\nfollows: yield, 3.7 g (67%); mass spectrum, mle 306 (M+);\ninfrared spectrum vmax/cm-1, 2,967, 2,930, 2,865, 1,747,\n1,693, 1,624, 1,249; NMR in CDCl3 8 ppm, 1.13 to 1.38 (3H,\ntriplet, -OCH2CH3), 1.59 to 1.66 (12H, singlet, C=C-CH3),\n1.98 to 2.33 (8H, methylene protons), 3.4 (2H, singlet, O=C-\nCH2-C=O), 3.98 to 4.33 (2H, quartet, O-CH2-CH3), 5.06\n(2H, C=C-H), 6.07 (1H, C=CH-C=O).\nSynthesis of 5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-trienoic acid.\n4-Bromobutyric acid (4.37 g) and triphenylphosphine (6.9 g)\nwere dissolved in minimum amount of toluene and refluxed\nfor5 h at 110\u00b0C. The resulting solid was dissolved in boiling\nchloroform-ethanol\n(20:1),\nprecipitated\nwith\nether,\nand\ndried. The phosphonium salt (3 g) was added over a period of\n2 min to 1.4 g of sodium hydride in 40 ml of dry tetrahydro-\nfuran under nitrogen gas at 4\u00b0C. After the preparation was\nstirred for 1.5 h at 50\u00b0C, geranylacetone (2.1 ml) was added\nat 25\u00b0C to the mixture, which was then stirred for 48 h at\n40\u00b0C. The solution was diluted with water, acidified to pH 3\nwith 30% phosphoric acid, and extracted with ethyl acetate,\nand the ethyl acetate extract was dried over anhydrous\nsodium sulfate. Removal of solvent yielded 4.5 g of crude\noily material, and the crude material was purified by silica\ngel chromatography with hexane-ether-acetic acid (9:1:0.01)\nas the eluent. The yield was 0.26 g (14%). The infrared and\nNMR spectra of synthetic 5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-\ntrienoic acid coincided completely with those of the biolog-\nical product.\nSynthesis of 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-4,8,12-trien-2-one.

The ether extract\nwas washed three times with water, dried over anhydrous\nmagnesium\nsulfate, and evaporated\nto dryness, yielding\n150 mg of 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-4,8,12-trien-2-one (89%).\nOther analytical data were as follows: mass spectrum, mle\n234 (M+); infrared spectrum vmax/cm-1, 2,963, 2,917, 2,868,\n1,719, 1,691, 1,619, 1,448, 1,382, 1,362; NMR spectrum in\nCDC13 8 ppm, 1.62 to 1.68 (12H, singlet, C=C-CH2), 2.00 to\n2.37 (1SH, O=C-CH3 and methylene protons), 5.09 (2H,\n-C=C-H), 6.05 (1H, C=CH-C=O).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWhen cells of Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11 were disrupted\nby sonication, all of the squalene-oxidizing activity (76% of\nthat in resting cells) was found in the pellet fraction, and\nnone was found in the supernatant. This phenomenon was\nalso observed when cells were disrupted with a French press\nor Braun homogenizer or when cells grown to a different\nphase or on different media were used.\nAll attempts to\nsolubilize the activity were unsuccessful, indicating that the\nenzyme or enzymes responsible were tightly bound to the\ncell membrane. Therefore, we used the pellet suspension as\nthe cell-free enzyme for further study.\nTime course study of squalene degradation by the pellet\nsuspension (Fig. 1) revealed that the stoichiometry between\nsqualene and geranylacetone changed after 9 h of reaction.\nUntil 9 h, the ratio of squalene to geranylacetone was 1:1.8,\nbut thereafter\nit changed to 1:0.8. This result can be ex-\nplained by assuming two routes for geranylacetone forma-\ntion, one less stable than the other.\nTo learn more about these routes, we investigated the\neffect of substrate concentration on geranylacetone forma-\ntion (Fig. 2). As substrates we considered both squalene and\nmolecular oxygen, because an oxygen atom should be incor-\nporated into the squalene molecule during its conversion to\ngeranylacetone, and molecular oxygen might be a substrate.\nGeranylacetone formation showed a simple hyperbolic de-\npendence on squalene concentration, with a Km of 15.9 mM.\nFurthermore, an absolute requirement for molecular oxygen\nwas demonstrated (Fig. 2B), indicating that the two routes\nshared initial reaction(s) catalyzed by an oxygenase.

The reaction was performed with the pellet suspension at 35\u00b0C\nfor the indicated period.\nwe performed the enzyme reaction under an atmosphere of\n40% 180260% N2 and analyzed the geranylacetone formed\nby mass spectrometry (Fig. 3).

It is thus appar-\nent that part of the geranylacetone was formed by the attack\nof molecular oxygen, i.e., by an oxygenase-catalyzed reac-\ntion, whereas the rest seemed to be formed by the attack of\nwater. Actually, when the reaction was performed under air\nwith 40% H2180-60% H2160 instead of normal water, the\nratio between [180]geranylacetone and [160]geranylacetone\nwas 0.19:0.81, which agreed well with the expected incor-\nporation of 20%.\n1602\n160\n170\n180\n190\n200\nmWe\n1802\n160\n170\n180\n190\n200\nmie\nFIG. 3.

By fluorography, we detected two polar com-\npounds (compounds 3 and 4) other than geranylacetone (Rs\nof squalene, geranylacetone, and compounds 3 and 4 were\n0.93, 0.57, 0.09, and 0.04, respectively, with hexane-ether\n[8:2] as the solvent). To obtain enough of compounds 3 and\n4 to identify their structure, we incubated 26 g of squalene\nwith 500 ml of the pellet suspension in 0.25 M potassium\nphosphate containing 1 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2 for 12 h\nat 35\u00b0C.\nExtraction of the reaction mixture with ethyl\nacetate, drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evapo-\nration of the solvent gave 25.6 g of oily product. This oil was\npartitioned between hexane and methanol-water (9:1). Non-\npolar compounds, such as the remaining squalene, were\nalmost totally removed into the hexane layer. Evaporation of\nthe methanol-water layer gave 1.28 g of oil material, and this\nwas fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatogra-\nphy with hexane-ether (8:2) as the solvent system (flow rate,\n2 mllmin; detection at 220 nm).

The mass spectrum of the compound 4\nmethyl ester was mle 278 (M+), 263, 235, 194.\nThe infrared spectra of compounds 3 and 4 indicated that\nthey both have a carboxyl group and some double bonds.\nThe 'H-NMR spectrum of compound 3 indicated that it has\nthree olefinic methyl groups, one with trans geometrical\nisomerism. The doublet methyl protons appearing at 0.98\nppm revealed one reduced double bond in the molecule, and\nits location was deduced from the signals of olefinic protons\nand methylene protons. The 1H-NMR spectrum of com-\npound 4 revealed four olefinic methyl groups. Considering\nthat compounds 3 and 4 were derived from squalene, we\nidentified\ntheir\nstructure\nas\n3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-6,10-\ndienoic\nacid and 5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-trienoic\nacid, respectively, based on their spectral data. The struc-\nture of compound 4 was also confirmed by the agreement\nwith chemically synthesized compound 4 in all aspects of\ninfrared and NMR data.\nCompound 4 acted as a precursor for geranylacetone\nsynthesis, whereas compound 3 did not (Table 1). Therefore,\nwe assumed that compound 4 was a true precursor and that\ncompound 3 was an offshoot product from compound 4.\nBased on these lines of evidence, we postulated the pathway\nfrom squalene to geranylacetone in Arthrobacter sp. strain\nY-11 shown in Fig. 4. Hence, squalene is oxidatively cleaved\ninto geranylacetone and acyclic aldehyde (compound 7),\nprobably by a kind of dioxygenase; compound 7 is oxidized\nto compound 4, which we isolated from the reaction product;\nand compound 4 is further oxidized at C-3 to form 3-oxo-\ntrienoic acid (compound 5) or spontaneously cleaved to\ntrienoic ketone (compound 6). Either compound 5 or 6 is\nattacked by water, followed by retroaldol-type cleavage to\nyield another geranylacetone (compound 2').\n6HH\nor\n5\n'\n6\nHSQ\nH~~~~~~~~\nor\ni\n+\nH\n2\n7\nA J\nk\nJOH '-\nOHOH\n3\n4\nFIG. 4.

The\nenzyme or enzymes catalyzing squalene degradation were found to be membrane bound. Stoichiometric\nanalysis of a cell-free system revealed that the ratio of squalene to trans-geranylacetone changed from 1:2 to 1:1\nas the reaction proceeded, indicating two steps in geranylacetone formation. The initial step was found to be\noxygenase catalyzed, from the absolute requirement for molecular oxygen in geranylacetone formation and the\nincorporation of 180 into geranylacetone under 1802 atmosphere. By using [3H]squalene as the substrate, we\ndetected an intermediate in the pathway and identified it as 5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-trienoic acid by\nmass spectrometry, infrared spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, and chemical synthesis.\nWe deduced that squalene was first oxidatively cleaved to geranylacetone and the intermediate, and that the\nintermediate was further metabolized to geranylacetone. We also synthesized some of the presumptive\nmetabolites, such as 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-4,8,12-trien-2-one, and confirmed that they served as active\nprecursors for geranylacetone formation. Based on these lines of evidence, we present here the pathway from\nsqualene to trans-geranylacetone in Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11.\nSqualene is a naturally abundant acyclic triterpene and is\na common intermediate in the formation of steroids and\ntriterpenes. 1n investigating the microbial transformation of\nsqualene, we isolated Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11 (7, 8),\nCorynebacterium sp. strain S-401 (3, 4), and Corynebacte-\nrium sp. strain SY-79 (5, 9, 10). Corynebacterium sp. strain\nSY-79 oxidizes the terminal carbon of squalene, forming C30\ndicarboxylic acid, and Corynebacterium sp. strain S-401\nhydrates the double bonds of squalene; but Arthrobacter sp.\nstrain Y-11 is unique in that it oxidatively cleaves the central\npart of the squalene molecule regioselectively to form two\nmolecules of trans-geranylacetone.\nSince the squalene molecule is linear and symmetrical,\nhaving six almost equivalent double bonds, this regioselec-\ntive reaction pathway attracted our attention. 1n the present\nstudy, we examined the reaction pathway from squalene to\ngeranylacetone by using a cell-free system of Arthrobacter\nsp. strain Y-11. We found that one molecule of geranylace-\ntone was formed directly by an oxygenase, leaving a C14 unit\nthat was further metabolized via several steps to form\nanother molecule of geranylacetone.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStrain. Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11, isolated from soil (8),\nwas used throughout this study.\nChemicals. 1802 (99 atom%) and H2180 (70 atom%) were\nobtained from Amersham 1nternational, Amersham, United\nKingdom.

A seed\nculture was prepared by inoculation from slant culture of\nArthrobacter sp. strain Y-11 into 100 ml of medium (pH 7.0)\ncontaining 2% (wt/vol) corn steep liquor and 0.6% (vol/vol)\nsqualene in a 500-ml Sakaguchi flask. This was incubated for\n40 h at 30\u00b0C on a reciprocating shaker (120 strokes per min),\ndiluted with an equal volume of 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, and\nstored at -80\u00b0C. The seed culture (2 ml) was inoculated into\n400 ml of medium containing 2% (wt/vol) corn steep liquor,\n0.3% (vol/vol) salad oil (Ajinomoto Co., Tokyo), and 0.03%\n(vol/vol) squalene in a 500-ml Sakaguchi flask. Flasks were\nincubated at 30\u00b0C for 65 h on a reciprocating shaker (120\nstrokes per min). Cells were collected by centrifugation at\n6,000 x g for 15 min, washed twice with 0.05 M potassium\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and stored at -80\u00b0C until used.\nReaction conditions with cell-free system.

Cell debris was collected by\ncentrifugation at 7,000 x g for 5 min, washed once with 0.25\nM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), and suspended in 0.25 M\npotassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The pellet suspension (1.0\nml) and squalene (0.2 ml) were mixed in a test tube (16.5 by\n165 mm) and incubated for 2 to 3 h at 35\u00b0C on a reciprocating\nshaker (150 strokes per min). The reaction mixture was\nacidified with 4 N HCI, mixed with 0.1 mg of pentadecane as\nan internal standard, and extracted with ethyl acetate; the\ngeranylacetone content of the ethyl acetate layer was deter-\nmined by gas chromatography.

Ltd.) equipped\nwith a Necleosil 100-10 column (10 by 300 mm; Macherey-\nNagel, Duren). 1nfrared spectra were recorded on a Hitachi\nmodel 215 grating infrared spectrophotometer. Oily samples\nwere run as a neat liquid film between NaCl plates. Nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) spectra in CDCI3 were recorded\nwith a JEOL model PS 100 spectrophotometer, with tetra-\nmethylsilane as an internal standard. Mass spectra were\nobtained with a Hitachi RMU-6E mass spectrometer.\nReaction with [3H]squalene. A pellet suspension (0.1 ml) in\n0.25 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing [4,8,12,13,\n17,21-3H]squalene (1 ,uCi) was incubated for 2 h at 35\u00b0C,\ndiluted with 0.9 ml of water, and extracted three times with\n1-ml portions of ethyl acetate. After evaporation of the ethyl\nacetate layer, the residue was developed on a silica gel plate\n(Kiselgel 60 F254; E. Merck AG, Darmstadt, Federal Repub-\nlic of Germany) with hexane-ether (8:2,\nvol/vol)\nas the\nsolvent. Radioactive material on the plate was detected by\nfluorography with 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 2-methylnaph-\nthalene\n(2) for 65 h\nat -80\u00b0C.\nAuthentic squalene and\ngeranylacetone were spotted on a separate plate and treated\nsimilarly, except that potassium permanganate was used for\ndetection.\nReaction with 1802 in the cell-free system. A pellet suspen-\nsion (1.0 ml) in 0.25 M potassium phosphate containing 1\nmM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 ml of squalene was placed\nin a test tube fitted with an airtight septum. After complete\nremoval of air by vacuum pump, the test tube was filled with\n40% 1802 (99 atom%) in N2. After standing for 48 h at 35\u00b0C,\nthe reaction mixture was extracted four times with dichlo-\nromethane, and the dichloromethane layer was dried over\nanhydrous sodium sulfate. After evaporation of the solvent,\ngeranylacetone in the residue was purified by high-perfor-\nmance liquid chromatography with hexane-ether (8:2) as the\neluting solvent.\nSynthesis of ethyl 3-oxo-5,9,13,-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-\ntrienoate. Ethyl 4-diethylphosphono-3-oxobutanoate (4.8 g),\nprepared from ethyl 4-bromoacetoacetate (6) and diethyl-\nphosphite by the method of Bodalski et al. (1), was dissolved\nin 40 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran. This was added in portions\nto a suspension of NaH (1.8 g in 60 ml of dry tetrahydrofu-\nran) at 25\u00b0C with stirring under nitrogen gas over a period of\n10 min. After 30 min of stirring, geranylacetone (3.5 g in 20\nml of dry tetrahydrofuran) was added in portions to the\nmixture, which was then allowed to react for 5 h at 38\u00b0C. The\nsolution was poured into 100 ml of cold 1 N HCl, and the\nmixture was extracted twice with 200-ml portions of ethyl\nacetate. The ethyl acetate layer was washed three times with\nwater and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation\nof the solvent gave 7.54 g of oily residue, which was further\npurified by column chromatography on 130 g of silica gel\nwith hexane-ethyl acetate (98:2). The analytical data were as\nfollows: yield, 3.7 g (67%); mass spectrum, mle 306 (M+);\ninfrared spectrum vmax/cm-1, 2,967, 2,930, 2,865, 1,747,\n1,693, 1,624, 1,249; NMR in CDCl3 8 ppm, 1.13 to 1.38 (3H,\ntriplet, -OCH2CH3), 1.59 to 1.66 (12H, singlet, C=C-CH3),\n1.98 to 2.33 (8H, methylene protons), 3.4 (2H, singlet, O=C-\nCH2-C=O), 3.98 to 4.33 (2H, quartet, O-CH2-CH3), 5.06\n(2H, C=C-H), 6.07 (1H, C=CH-C=O).\nSynthesis of 5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-trienoic acid.\n4-Bromobutyric acid (4.37 g) and triphenylphosphine (6.9 g)\nwere dissolved in minimum amount of toluene and refluxed\nfor5 h at 110\u00b0C. The resulting solid was dissolved in boiling\nchloroform-ethanol\n(20:1),\nprecipitated\nwith\nether,\nand\ndried. The phosphonium salt (3 g) was added over a period of\n2 min to 1.4 g of sodium hydride in 40 ml of dry tetrahydro-\nfuran under nitrogen gas at 4\u00b0C. After the preparation was\nstirred for 1.5 h at 50\u00b0C, geranylacetone (2.1 ml) was added\nat 25\u00b0C to the mixture, which was then stirred for 48 h at\n40\u00b0C. The solution was diluted with water, acidified to pH 3\nwith 30% phosphoric acid, and extracted with ethyl acetate,\nand the ethyl acetate extract was dried over anhydrous\nsodium sulfate. Removal of solvent yielded 4.5 g of crude\noily material, and the crude material was purified by silica\ngel chromatography with hexane-ether-acetic acid (9:1:0.01)\nas the eluent. The yield was 0.26 g (14%). The infrared and\nNMR spectra of synthetic 5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-\ntrienoic acid coincided completely with those of the biolog-\nical product.\nSynthesis of 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-4,8,12-trien-2-one. Ethyl\n3-oxo-5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-trienoate\n(220\nmg)\nwas dissolved\nin a mixture of tetrahydrofuran\n(10 ml),\ndimethylsulfoxide (2 ml), water (2 ml), and 2 N NaOH (2 ml).\nThe resulting solution was stirred for 16 h at 50\u00b0C, diluted\nwith 1 N HCl, and extracted with ether. The ether extract\nwas washed three times with water, dried over anhydrous\nmagnesium\nsulfate, and evaporated\nto dryness, yielding\n150 mg of 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-4,8,12-trien-2-one (89%).\nOther analytical data were as follows: mass spectrum, mle\n234 (M+); infrared spectrum vmax/cm-1, 2,963, 2,917, 2,868,\n1,719, 1,691, 1,619, 1,448, 1,382, 1,362; NMR spectrum in\nCDC13 8 ppm, 1.62 to 1.68 (12H, singlet, C=C-CH2), 2.00 to\n2.37 (1SH, O=C-CH3 and methylene protons), 5.09 (2H,\n-C=C-H), 6.05 (1H, C=CH-C=O).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWhen cells of Arthrobacter sp. strain Y-11 were disrupted\nby sonication, all of the squalene-oxidizing activity (76% of\nthat in resting cells) was found in the pellet fraction, and\nnone was found in the supernatant. This phenomenon was\nalso observed when cells were disrupted with a French press\nor Braun homogenizer or when cells grown to a different\nphase or on different media were used.\nAll attempts to\nsolubilize the activity were unsuccessful, indicating that the\nenzyme or enzymes responsible were tightly bound to the\ncell membrane. Therefore, we used the pellet suspension as\nthe cell-free enzyme for further study.\nTime course study of squalene degradation by the pellet\nsuspension (Fig. 1) revealed that the stoichiometry between\nsqualene and geranylacetone changed after 9 h of reaction.\nUntil 9 h, the ratio of squalene to geranylacetone was 1:1.8,\nbut thereafter\nit changed to 1:0.8. This result can be ex-\nplained by assuming two routes for geranylacetone forma-\ntion, one less stable than the other.\nTo learn more about these routes, we investigated the\neffect of substrate concentration on geranylacetone forma-\ntion (Fig. 2). As substrates we considered both squalene and\nmolecular oxygen, because an oxygen atom should be incor-\nporated into the squalene molecule during its conversion to\ngeranylacetone, and molecular oxygen might be a substrate.\nGeranylacetone formation showed a simple hyperbolic de-\npendence on squalene concentration, with a Km of 15.9 mM.\nFurthermore, an absolute requirement for molecular oxygen\nwas demonstrated (Fig. 2B), indicating that the two routes\nshared initial reaction(s) catalyzed by an oxygenase.

The reaction was performed with the pellet suspension at 35\u00b0C\nfor the indicated period.\nwe performed the enzyme reaction under an atmosphere of\n40% 180260% N2 and analyzed the geranylacetone formed\nby mass spectrometry (Fig. 3).

Actually, when the reaction was performed under air\nwith 40% H2180-60% H2160 instead of normal water, the\nratio between [180]geranylacetone and [160]geranylacetone\nwas 0.19:0.81, which agreed well with the expected incor-\nporation of 20%.\n1602\n160\n170\n180\n190\n200\nmWe\n1802\n160\n170\n180\n190\n200\nmie\nFIG. 3.

By fluorography, we detected two polar com-\npounds (compounds 3 and 4) other than geranylacetone (Rs\nof squalene, geranylacetone, and compounds 3 and 4 were\n0.93, 0.57, 0.09, and 0.04, respectively, with hexane-ether\n[8:2] as the solvent). To obtain enough of compounds 3 and\n4 to identify their structure, we incubated 26 g of squalene\nwith 500 ml of the pellet suspension in 0.25 M potassium\nphosphate containing 1 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2 for 12 h\nat 35\u00b0C.\nExtraction of the reaction mixture with ethyl\nacetate, drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evapo-\nration of the solvent gave 25.6 g of oily product. This oil was\npartitioned between hexane and methanol-water (9:1). Non-\npolar compounds, such as the remaining squalene, were\nalmost totally removed into the hexane layer. Evaporation of\nthe methanol-water layer gave 1.28 g of oil material, and this\nwas fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatogra-\nphy with hexane-ether (8:2) as the solvent system (flow rate,\n2 mllmin; detection at 220 nm). Two products, compounds 3\nand 4, were obtained (about 50 mg of each; retention times of\nsqualene, geranylacetone, and compounds 3 and 4 were\n14.8, 22.7, 26.7, and 28.5 min, respectively).\nThe analytical data for compound 3 were as follows:\ninfrared spectrum (film) vmax/cm-1, 3,400 to 2,400 (COOH),\n1,700 (C=O), 1,640 (C=C); 'H-NMR spectrum in CDCl3 8\nppm, 7.7 (1H, broad, COOH), 5.1 (2H, t, =CH), 2.4 to 2.1\n(2H, m, CH2C=O), 2.1 to 1.9 (6H, m, =C-CH2), 1.63 (3H, s,\n=C-CH3), 1.59 (6H, s, =C-CH3), 1.5 to 1.2 (2H, m, CH2),\n0.98 (3H, d, CH-CH3).

The mass spectrum of the compound 4\nmethyl ester was mle 278 (M+), 263, 235, 194.\nThe infrared spectra of compounds 3 and 4 indicated that\nthey both have a carboxyl group and some double bonds.\nThe 'H-NMR spectrum of compound 3 indicated that it has\nthree olefinic methyl groups, one with trans geometrical\nisomerism. The doublet methyl protons appearing at 0.98\nppm revealed one reduced double bond in the molecule, and\nits location was deduced from the signals of olefinic protons\nand methylene protons. The 1H-NMR spectrum of com-\npound 4 revealed four olefinic methyl groups. Considering\nthat compounds 3 and 4 were derived from squalene, we\nidentified\ntheir\nstructure\nas\n3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-6,10-\ndienoic\nacid and 5,9,13-trimethyltetradeca-4,8,12-trienoic\nacid, respectively, based on their spectral data. The struc-\nture of compound 4 was also confirmed by the agreement\nwith chemically synthesized compound 4 in all aspects of\ninfrared and NMR data.\nCompound 4 acted as a precursor for geranylacetone\nsynthesis, whereas compound 3 did not (Table 1). Therefore,\nwe assumed that compound 4 was a true precursor and that\ncompound 3 was an offshoot product from compound 4.\nBased on these lines of evidence, we postulated the pathway\nfrom squalene to geranylacetone in Arthrobacter sp. strain\nY-11 shown in Fig. 4. Hence, squalene is oxidatively cleaved\ninto geranylacetone and acyclic aldehyde (compound 7),\nprobably by a kind of dioxygenase; compound 7 is oxidized\nto compound 4, which we isolated from the reaction product;\nand compound 4 is further oxidized at C-3 to form 3-oxo-\ntrienoic acid (compound 5) or spontaneously cleaved to\ntrienoic ketone (compound 6). Either compound 5 or 6 is\nattacked by water, followed by retroaldol-type cleavage to\nyield another geranylacetone (compound 2').\n6HH\nor\n5\n'\n6\nHSQ\nH~~~~~~~~\nor\ni\n+\nH\n2\n7\nA J\nk\nJOH '-\nOHOH\n3\n4\nFIG. 4.

We chose its\nethyl ester as substrate because compound 5 would be\nformed by a contaminating lipase in our enzyme preparation.\nActually we observed the formation of free compound 5\nduring the enzyme reaction. The two compounds as well as\ncompound 4 served as substrates for geranylacetone forma-\ntion (Table 1).

As laboratories\nmay use any one or multiple methods, it is of interest to know\nhow MIC results for a drug will compare across methods. 1n\nthis study the in vitro activity of doripenem against relevant\nGram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens was determined\nby three MIC methods: broth microdilution or the standard\nreference method, agar dilution, and Etest. The BMD MICs\nwere compared to results from agar dilution and Etest.\n(This work was presented in part at the 47th 1nterscience\nConference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Chi-\ncago, 1L, 2007 [1].)\nRecent clinical isolates (n \u0005 513) were studied from eight\nmajor organism groups based on the current groupings in the\nClinical and Laboratory Standards 1nstitute (CLSI) M100 sup-\nplement (6). The organism groups were Staphylococcus spp.,\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus beta-hemolytic group,\nStreptococcus viridans group, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteri-\naceae, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. The appropriate\nCLSI quality control (QC) strains Staphylococcus aureus\nATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, S. pneu-\nmoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and P.\naeruginosa ATCC 27853 were evaluated concurrently with ev-\nery test.\nBroth microdilution MIC testing followed CLSI methodol-\nogy (4, 5) using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth\n(Sensititre; Trek Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, OH) with or\nwithout the addition of 3% lysed horse blood (Hardy Diagnos-\ntics, Santa Maria, CA). Custom susceptibility panels in the\nfrozen format were obtained from Trek Diagnostic Systems\n(Cleveland, OH).\nAgar dilution MIC testing was performed on MH 1I agar\n(BD BBL, Sparks, MD) according to CLSI methodology (4, 5).\nTABLE 2.

CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\nOrganisms were inoculated onto 100-mm agar plates prepared\non the day of testing with a replicator (Craft Machine 1nc.,\nChester, PA) that delivered 2 \u0001l per spot. For streptococci\nother than S. pneumoniae, MH agar was supplemented with\n5% sheep blood (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA).\nMIC testing by the doripenem Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna,\nSweden) was performed and results were interpreted accord-\ning to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. MH 1I agar plates (BD\nBBL, Sparks, MD) and plates of MH with 5% sheep blood\nagar (BD BBL, Sparks, MD) were used. Etest MICs were\nrounded up to the nearest 2-fold dilution in a standard MIC\ntest, and these values were used in comparisons between the\nEtest and the reference BMD method.\nMIC values for isolates to doripenem were generated by\nBMD, agar dilution, and Etest methods. Agar dilution MICs\nwere not determined for S. pneumoniae, since agar dilution is\nnot a recommended reference method for this organism. The\nMIC results from agar dilution and Etest were compared to\nthose from the standard reference BMD MIC method. For all\nisolates, the comparator carbapenem class agent, meropenem,\nwas tested in parallel with doripenem. 1n testing of the appro-\npriate CLSI QC strains, both doripenem and meropenem per-\nformed within acceptable CLSI QC limits (data not shown).\nThe distribution of doripenem MIC values against Gram-\nnegative and Gram-positive clinical isolates is shown in Table\n1. The isolates were chosen to provide a range of MIC values\nand were not selected at random. Thus, the number of resistant\nisolates is higher than those that would be found in a random\npopulation. The percentages of doripenem-susceptible clinical\nisolates were 98% (98/100) for Enterobacteriaceae, 80% (64/80)\nfor P. aeruginosa, and 55% (11/20) for Acinetobacter baumannii\nbased on FDA breakpoints. Of the viridans group streptococci,\nseven isolates were identi\ufb01ed as Streptococcus anginosus group,\nand of these seven isolates 100% were doripenem susceptible.\nThe FDA susceptible MIC breakpoints for doripenem are\n\u00010.5 \u0001g/ml for Enterobacteriaceae, \u00012 \u0001g/ml for P. aeruginosa,\n\u00011 \u0001g/ml for A. baumannii, and \u00010.12 \u0001g/ml for S. anginosus\ngroup. At this time, susceptible breakpoints for doripenem\nhave not been determined for the other organism groups.\nThe BMD, agar dilution, and Etest doripenem MIC values\nare summarized in Table 2. Among the Gram-negative iso-\nlates, all methods yielded a doripenem MIC90 for Enterobac-\nteriaceae of 0.25 \u0001g/ml. For P. aeruginosa the BMD and Etest\nMIC90s were 8 \u0001g/ml and the agar dilution MIC90 was 4 \u0001g/ml\nfor doripenem. For A. baumannii, the BMD, Etest, and agar\ndilution MIC90 values were 16, \u000232, and 8 \u0001g/ml, respectively.\nAgainst 49 enterococci, the MIC50 and MIC90 were 4 and\n\u000216 \u0001g/ml, respectively, by all three methods. For all staphy-\nlococci, the doripenem MIC90s were 2 \u0001g/ml by BMD and agar\ndilution and 4 \u0001g/ml by Etest. The S. pneumoniae doripenem\nMIC90 was 0.5 \u0001g/ml by BMD and 2-fold higher by Etest. The\nMIC90 for beta-hemolytic streptococci was \u00010.015 \u0001g/ml by\nBMD and agar dilution and 0.03 \u0001g/ml by Etest; for viridans\ngroup streptococci the MIC90 was 0.25 \u0001g/ml for all test meth-\nods.\nAs doripenem has only susceptible FDA breakpoints, an\nanalysis of very major test errors was conducted for organisms\nthat were de\ufb01ned as nonsusceptible by the reference method,\nBMD, and categorized as susceptible by agar dilution or Etest.\nMajor errors were determined for organisms that were suscep-\ntible by BMD and nonsusceptible by agar dilution or Etest. For\nthe Enterobacteriaceae group, there was one very major error\nfor both agar dilution and Etest methods. Among the P. aerugi-\nnosa isolates tested, there was one major error by Etest. For A.\nbaumannii, there were three major errors by both agar dilution\nand Etest methods.\nDoripenem MICs for 60% (59/98) of the Enterobacteriaceae,\n55% (44/80) of the P. aeruginosa isolates, and 40% (8/20) of the\nA. baumannii isolates tested were identical for BMD and agar\ndilution within each group. Among the Gram-positive isolates\ntested, 50.7% (105/207) had identical MIC results for BMD\nand agar dilution (Table 3). Etest and BMD tests had a lower\npercentage of identical MIC results for many of the organism\ngroups, especially the Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, and\nnon-S. pneumoniae isolates. Etest and BMD MICs were iden-\ntical for only 28% (28/100) of the Enterobacteriaceae, 45%\n(36/80) of P. aeruginosa isolates, 45% (9/20) of A. baumannii\nTABLE 3.

This trend was also\nobserved in a previous study with P. aeruginosa isolates at or\nnear the doripenem breakpoint (2 \u0001g/ml) (2). 1n this study, the Etest method performed comparably to the\nstandard reference methods with \u000296% of the doripenem\nMICs within \u00072 log2 dilutions of the BMD and agar dilution\nmethods. Given the overall comparability of these three meth-\nods, laboratories should be comfortable in using their method\nof choice for MIC testing of doripenem.

As laboratories\nmay use any one or multiple methods, it is of interest to know\nhow MIC results for a drug will compare across methods. In\nthis study the in vitro activity of doripenem against relevant\nGram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens was determined\nby three MIC methods: broth microdilution or the standard\nreference method, agar dilution, and Etest. The BMD MICs\nwere compared to results from agar dilution and Etest.\n(This work was presented in part at the 47th Interscience\nConference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Chi-\ncago, IL, 2007 [1].)\nRecent clinical isolates (n \u0005 513) were studied from eight\nmajor organism groups based on the current groupings in the\nClinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100 sup-\nplement (6). The organism groups were Staphylococcus spp.,\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus beta-hemolytic group,\nStreptococcus viridans group, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteri-\naceae, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. The appropriate\nCLSI quality control (QC) strains Staphylococcus aureus\nATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, S. pneu-\nmoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and P.\naeruginosa ATCC 27853 were evaluated concurrently with ev-\nery test.\nBroth microdilution MIC testing followed CLSI methodol-\nogy (4, 5) using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth\n(Sensititre; Trek Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, OH) with or\nwithout the addition of 3% lysed horse blood (Hardy Diagnos-\ntics, Santa Maria, CA). Custom susceptibility panels in the\nfrozen format were obtained from Trek Diagnostic Systems\n(Cleveland, OH).\nAgar dilution MIC testing was performed on MH II agar\n(BD BBL, Sparks, MD) according to CLSI methodology (4, 5).\nTABLE 2.

CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\nOrganisms were inoculated onto 100-mm agar plates prepared\non the day of testing with a replicator (Craft Machine Inc.,\nChester, PA) that delivered 2 \u0001l per spot. For streptococci\nother than S. pneumoniae, MH agar was supplemented with\n5% sheep blood (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA).\nMIC testing by the doripenem Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna,\nSweden) was performed and results were interpreted accord-\ning to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. MH II agar plates (BD\nBBL, Sparks, MD) and plates of MH with 5% sheep blood\nagar (BD BBL, Sparks, MD) were used. Etest MICs were\nrounded up to the nearest 2-fold dilution in a standard MIC\ntest, and these values were used in comparisons between the\nEtest and the reference BMD method.\nMIC values for isolates to doripenem were generated by\nBMD, agar dilution, and Etest methods. Agar dilution MICs\nwere not determined for S. pneumoniae, since agar dilution is\nnot a recommended reference method for this organism. The\nMIC results from agar dilution and Etest were compared to\nthose from the standard reference BMD MIC method. For all\nisolates, the comparator carbapenem class agent, meropenem,\nwas tested in parallel with doripenem. In testing of the appro-\npriate CLSI QC strains, both doripenem and meropenem per-\nformed within acceptable CLSI QC limits (data not shown).\nThe distribution of doripenem MIC values against Gram-\nnegative and Gram-positive clinical isolates is shown in Table\n1. The isolates were chosen to provide a range of MIC values\nand were not selected at random. Thus, the number of resistant\nisolates is higher than those that would be found in a random\npopulation. The percentages of doripenem-susceptible clinical\nisolates were 98% (98/100) for Enterobacteriaceae, 80% (64/80)\nfor P. aeruginosa, and 55% (11/20) for Acinetobacter baumamii\nbased on FDA breakpoints. Of the viridans group streptococci,\nseven isolates were identi\ufb01ed as Streptococcus anginosus group,\nand of these seven isolates 100% were doripenem susceptible.\nThe FDA susceptible MIC breakpoints for doripenem are\n\u00010.5 \u0001g/ml for Enterobacteriaceae, \u00012 \u0001g/ml for P. aeruginosa,\n\u00011 \u0001g/ml for A. baumamii, and \u00010.12 \u0001g/ml for S. anginosus\ngroup. At this time, susceptible breakpoints for doripenem\nhave not been determined for the other organism groups.\nThe BMD, agar dilution, and Etest doripenem MIC values\nare summarized in Table 2. Among the Gram-negative iso-\nlates, all methods yielded a doripenem MIC90 for Enterobac-\nteriaceae of 0.25 \u0001g/ml. For P. aeruginosa the BMD and Etest\nMIC90s were 8 \u0001g/ml and the agar dilution MIC90 was 4 \u0001g/ml\nfor doripenem. For A. baumamii, the BMD, Etest, and agar\ndilution MIC90 values were 16, \u000232, and 8 \u0001g/ml, respectively.\nAgainst 49 enterococci, the MIC50 and MIC90 were 4 and\n\u000216 \u0001g/ml, respectively, by all three methods. For all staphy-\nlococci, the doripenem MIC90s were 2 \u0001g/ml by BMD and agar\ndilution and 4 \u0001g/ml by Etest. The S. pneumoniae doripenem\nMIC90 was 0.5 \u0001g/ml by BMD and 2-fold higher by Etest. The\nMIC90 for beta-hemolytic streptococci was \u00010.015 \u0001g/ml by\nBMD and agar dilution and 0.03 \u0001g/ml by Etest; for viridans\ngroup streptococci the MIC90 was 0.25 \u0001g/ml for all test meth-\nods.\nAs doripenem has only susceptible FDA breakpoints, an\nanalysis of very major test errors was conducted for organisms\nthat were de\ufb01ned as nonsusceptible by the reference method,\nBMD, and categorized as susceptible by agar dilution or Etest.\nMajor errors were determined for organisms that were suscep-\ntible by BMD and nonsusceptible by agar dilution or Etest. For\nthe Enterobacteriaceae group, there was one very major error\nfor both agar dilution and Etest methods. Among the P. aerugi-\nnosa isolates tested, there was one major error by Etest. For A.\nbaumamii, there were three major errors by both agar dilution\nand Etest methods.\nDoripenem MICs for 60% (59/98) of the Enterobacteriaceae,\n55% (44/80) of the P. aeruginosa isolates, and 40% (8/20) of the\nA. baumamii isolates tested were identical for BMD and agar\ndilution within each group. Among the Gram-positive isolates\ntested, 50.7% (105/207) had identical MIC results for BMD\nand agar dilution (Table 3). Etest and BMD tests had a lower\npercentage of identical MIC results for many of the organism\ngroups, especially the Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, and\nnon-S. pneumoniae isolates. Etest and BMD MICs were iden-\ntical for only 28% (28/100) of the Enterobacteriaceae, 45%\n(36/80) of P. aeruginosa isolates, 45% (9/20) of A. baumamii\nTABLE 3.

By Etest, most MICs, including the MIC mode and\nMIC90 values for all organisms examined, tended to be 1 log2\ndilution higher than the BMD values. This trend was also\nobserved in a previous study with P. aeruginosa isolates at or\nnear the doripenem breakpoint (2 \u0001g/ml) (2).\nIn this study, the Etest method performed comparably to the\nstandard reference methods with \u000296% of the doripenem\nMICs within \u00072 log2 dilutions of the BMD and agar dilution\nmethods. Given the overall comparability of these three meth-\nods, laboratories should be comfortable in using their method\nof choice for MIC testing of doripenem.

As laboratories\nmay use any one or multiple methods, it is of interest to know\nhow MIC results for a drug will compare across methods. In\nthis study the in vitro activity of doripenem against relevant\nGram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens was determined\nby three MIC methods: broth microdilution or the standard\nreference method, agar dilution, and Etest. The BMD MICs\nwere compared to results from agar dilution and Etest.\n(This work was presented in part at the 47th Interscience\nConference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Chi-\ncago, IL, 2007 [1].)\nRecent clinical isolates (n \u0005 513) were studied from eight\nmajor organism groups based on the current groupings in the\nClinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100 sup-\nplement (6).

CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\nOrganisms were inoculated onto 100-mm agar plates prepared\non the day of testing with a replicator (Craft Machine Inc.,\nChester, PA) that delivered 2 \u0001l per spot. For streptococci\nother than S. pneumoniae, MH agar was supplemented with\n5% sheep blood (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA).\nMIC testing by the doripenem Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna,\nSweden) was performed and results were interpreted accord-\ning to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. MH II agar plates (BD\nBBL, Sparks, MD) and plates of MH with 5% sheep blood\nagar (BD BBL, Sparks, MD) were used. Etest MICs were\nrounded up to the nearest 2-fold dilution in a standard MIC\ntest, and these values were used in comparisons between the\nEtest and the reference BMD method.\nMIC values for isolates to doripenem were generated by\nBMD, agar dilution, and Etest methods. Agar dilution MICs\nwere not determined for S. pneumoniae, since agar dilution is\nnot a recommended reference method for this organism. The\nMIC results from agar dilution and Etest were compared to\nthose from the standard reference BMD MIC method. For all\nisolates, the comparator carbapenem class agent, meropenem,\nwas tested in parallel with doripenem. In testing of the appro-\npriate CLSI QC strains, both doripenem and meropenem per-\nformed within acceptable CLSI QC limits (data not shown).\nThe distribution of doripenem MIC values against Gram-\nnegative and Gram-positive clinical isolates is shown in Table\n1. The isolates were chosen to provide a range of MIC values\nand were not selected at random. Thus, the number of resistant\nisolates is higher than those that would be found in a random\npopulation. The percentages of doripenem-susceptible clinical\nisolates were 98% (98/100) for Enterobacteriaceae, 80% (64/80)\nfor P. aeruginosa, and 55% (11/20) for Acinetobacter baumannii\nbased on FDA breakpoints. Of the viridans group streptococci,\nseven isolates were identi\ufb01ed as Streptococcus anginosus group,\nand of these seven isolates 100% were doripenem susceptible.\nThe FDA susceptible MIC breakpoints for doripenem are\n\u00010.5 \u0001g/ml for Enterobacteriaceae, \u00012 \u0001g/ml for P. aeruginosa,\n\u00011 \u0001g/ml for A. baumannii, and \u00010.12 \u0001g/ml for S. anginosus\ngroup. At this time, susceptible breakpoints for doripenem\nhave not been determined for the other organism groups.\nThe BMD, agar dilution, and Etest doripenem MIC values\nare summarized in Table 2. Among the Gram-negative iso-\nlates, all methods yielded a doripenem MIC90 for Enterobac-\nteriaceae of 0.25 \u0001g/ml. For P. aeruginosa the BMD and Etest\nMIC90s were 8 \u0001g/ml and the agar dilution MIC90 was 4 \u0001g/ml\nfor doripenem. For A. baumannii, the BMD, Etest, and agar\ndilution MIC90 values were 16, \u000232, and 8 \u0001g/ml, respectively.\nAgainst 49 enterococci, the MIC50 and MIC90 were 4 and\n\u000216 \u0001g/ml, respectively, by all three methods. For all staphy-\nlococci, the doripenem MIC90s were 2 \u0001g/ml by BMD and agar\ndilution and 4 \u0001g/ml by Etest. The S. pneumoniae doripenem\nMIC90 was 0.5 \u0001g/ml by BMD and 2-fold higher by Etest. The\nMIC90 for beta-hemolytic streptococci was \u00010.015 \u0001g/ml by\nBMD and agar dilution and 0.03 \u0001g/ml by Etest; for viridans\ngroup streptococci the MIC90 was 0.25 \u0001g/ml for all test meth-\nods.\nAs doripenem has only susceptible FDA breakpoints, an\nanalysis of very major test errors was conducted for organisms\nthat were de\ufb01ned as nonsusceptible by the reference method,\nBMD, and categorized as susceptible by agar dilution or Etest.\nMajor errors were determined for organisms that were suscep-\ntible by BMD and nonsusceptible by agar dilution or Etest. For\nthe Enterobacteriaceae group, there was one very major error\nfor both agar dilution and Etest methods. Among the P. aerugi-\nnosa isolates tested, there was one major error by Etest. For A.\nbaumannii, there were three major errors by both agar dilution\nand Etest methods.\nDoripenem MICs for 60% (59/98) of the Enterobacteriaceae,\n55% (44/80) of the P. aeruginosa isolates, and 40% (8/20) of the\nA. baumannii isolates tested were identical for BMD and agar\ndilution within each group. Among the Gram-positive isolates\ntested, 50.7% (105/207) had identical MIC results for BMD\nand agar dilution (Table 3). Etest and BMD tests had a lower\npercentage of identical MIC results for many of the organism\ngroups, especially the Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, and\nnon-S. pneumoniae isolates. Etest and BMD MICs were iden-\ntical for only 28% (28/100) of the Enterobacteriaceae, 45%\n(36/80) of P. aeruginosa isolates, 45% (9/20) of A. baumannii\nTABLE 3.

By Etest, most MICs, including the MIC mode and\nMIC90 values for all organisms examined, tended to be 1 log2\ndilution higher than the BMD values. This trend was also\nobserved in a previous study with P. aeruginosa isolates at or\nnear the doripenem breakpoint (2 \u0001g/ml) (2).\nIn this study, the Etest method performed comparably to the\nstandard reference methods with \u000296% of the doripenem\nMICs within \u00072 log2 dilutions of the BMD and agar dilution\nmethods. Given the overall comparability of these three meth-\nods, laboratories should be comfortable in using their method\nof choice for MIC testing of doripenem.

As laboratories\nmay use any one or multiple methods, it is of interest to know\nhow MIC results for a drug will compare across methods. 1n\nthis study the in vitro activity of doripenem against relevant\nGram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens was determined\nby three MIC methods: broth microdilution or the standard\nreference method, agar dilution, and Etest. The BMD MICs\nwere compared to results from agar dilution and Etest.\n(This work was presented in part at the 47th 1nterscience\nConference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Chi-\ncago, 1L, 2007 [1].)\nRecent clinical isolates (n \u0005 513) were studied from eight\nmajor organism groups based on the current groupings in the\nClinical and Laboratory Standards 1nstitute (CLSI) M100 sup-\nplement (6). The organism groups were Staphylococcus spp.,\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus beta-hemolytic group,\nStreptococcus viridans group, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteri-\naceae, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. The appropriate\nCLSI quality control (QC) strains Staphylococcus aureus\nATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, S. pneu-\nmoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and P.\naeruginosa ATCC 27853 were evaluated concurrently with ev-\nery test.\nBroth microdilution MIC testing followed CLSI methodol-\nogy (4, 5) using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth\n(Sensititre; Trek Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, OH) with or\nwithout the addition of 3% lysed horse blood (Hardy Diagnos-\ntics, Santa Maria, CA). Custom susceptibility panels in the\nfrozen format were obtained from Trek Diagnostic Systems\n(Cleveland, OH).\nAgar dilution MIC testing was performed on MH 1I agar\n(BD BBL, Sparks, MD) according to CLSI methodology (4, 5).\nTABLE 2.

CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\nOrganisms were inoculated onto 100-mm agar plates prepared\non the day of testing with a replicator (Craft Machine 1nc.,\nChester, PA) that delivered 2 \u0001l per spot. For streptococci\nother than S. pneumoniae, MH agar was supplemented with\n5% sheep blood (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA).\nMIC testing by the doripenem Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna,\nSweden) was performed and results were interpreted accord-\ning to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. MH 1I agar plates (BD\nBBL, Sparks, MD) and plates of MH with 5% sheep blood\nagar (BD BBL, Sparks, MD) were used. Etest MICs were\nrounded up to the nearest 2-fold dilution in a standard MIC\ntest, and these values were used in comparisons between the\nEtest and the reference BMD method.\nMIC values for isolates to doripenem were generated by\nBMD, agar dilution, and Etest methods. Agar dilution MICs\nwere not determined for S. pneumoniae, since agar dilution is\nnot a recommended reference method for this organism. The\nMIC results from agar dilution and Etest were compared to\nthose from the standard reference BMD MIC method. For all\nisolates, the comparator carbapenem class agent, meropenem,\nwas tested in parallel with doripenem. 1n testing of the appro-\npriate CLSI QC strains, both doripenem and meropenem per-\nformed within acceptable CLSI QC limits (data not shown).\nThe distribution of doripenem MIC values against Gram-\nnegative and Gram-positive clinical isolates is shown in Table\n1. The isolates were chosen to provide a range of MIC values\nand were not selected at random. Thus, the number of resistant\nisolates is higher than those that would be found in a random\npopulation. The percentages of doripenem-susceptible clinical\nisolates were 98% (98/100) for Enterobacteriaceae, 80% (64/80)\nfor P. aeruginosa, and 55% (11/20) for Acinetobacter baumamii\nbased on FDA breakpoints. Of the viridans group streptococci,\nseven isolates were identi\ufb01ed as Streptococcus anginosus group,\nand of these seven isolates 100% were doripenem susceptible.\nThe FDA susceptible MIC breakpoints for doripenem are\n\u00010.5 \u0001g/ml for Enterobacteriaceae, \u00012 \u0001g/ml for P. aeruginosa,\n\u00011 \u0001g/ml for A. baumamii, and \u00010.12 \u0001g/ml for S. anginosus\ngroup. At this time, susceptible breakpoints for doripenem\nhave not been determined for the other organism groups.\nThe BMD, agar dilution, and Etest doripenem MIC values\nare summarized in Table 2. Among the Gram-negative iso-\nlates, all methods yielded a doripenem MIC90 for Enterobac-\nteriaceae of 0.25 \u0001g/ml. For P. aeruginosa the BMD and Etest\nMIC90s were 8 \u0001g/ml and the agar dilution MIC90 was 4 \u0001g/ml\nfor doripenem. For A. baumamii, the BMD, Etest, and agar\ndilution MIC90 values were 16, \u000232, and 8 \u0001g/ml, respectively.\nAgainst 49 enterococci, the MIC50 and MIC90 were 4 and\n\u000216 \u0001g/ml, respectively, by all three methods. For all staphy-\nlococci, the doripenem MIC90s were 2 \u0001g/ml by BMD and agar\ndilution and 4 \u0001g/ml by Etest. The S. pneumoniae doripenem\nMIC90 was 0.5 \u0001g/ml by BMD and 2-fold higher by Etest. The\nMIC90 for beta-hemolytic streptococci was \u00010.015 \u0001g/ml by\nBMD and agar dilution and 0.03 \u0001g/ml by Etest; for viridans\ngroup streptococci the MIC90 was 0.25 \u0001g/ml for all test meth-\nods.\nAs doripenem has only susceptible FDA breakpoints, an\nanalysis of very major test errors was conducted for organisms\nthat were de\ufb01ned as nonsusceptible by the reference method,\nBMD, and categorized as susceptible by agar dilution or Etest.\nMajor errors were determined for organisms that were suscep-\ntible by BMD and nonsusceptible by agar dilution or Etest. For\nthe Enterobacteriaceae group, there was one very major error\nfor both agar dilution and Etest methods. Among the P. aerugi-\nnosa isolates tested, there was one major error by Etest. For A.\nbaumamii, there were three major errors by both agar dilution\nand Etest methods.\nDoripenem MICs for 60% (59/98) of the Enterobacteriaceae,\n55% (44/80) of the P. aeruginosa isolates, and 40% (8/20) of the\nA. baumamii isolates tested were identical for BMD and agar\ndilution within each group. Among the Gram-positive isolates\ntested, 50.7% (105/207) had identical MIC results for BMD\nand agar dilution (Table 3). Etest and BMD tests had a lower\npercentage of identical MIC results for many of the organism\ngroups, especially the Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, and\nnon-S. pneumoniae isolates. Etest and BMD MICs were iden-\ntical for only 28% (28/100) of the Enterobacteriaceae, 45%\n(36/80) of P. aeruginosa isolates, 45% (9/20) of A. baumamii\nTABLE 3.

Because the \ufb02uids had to be heated to\nremove nonspeci\ufb01c reactivity before being tested in the immunoassay and type 19A PS is heat labile, the pleural\n\ufb02uid samples were also tested for serotype 19A capsule gene locus by PCR. Use of the multiplex immunoassay\ncombined with type-speci\ufb01c 19A PCR allowed for serotype determination on 40 of 49 pleural \ufb02uids. Pneumo-\ncoccal pneumonia with pleural effusion was associated with a limited number of serotypes, with types 1, 3, 7F/A,\nand 19A accounting for 75% of the typeable cases. The concentration of capsular PS in the pleural \ufb02uids was\noften greater than 1 \u0001g/ml and suf\ufb01cient to inhibit the opsonic capacity of sera from individuals who had\nreceived the 23-valent pneumococcal PS vaccine. Based on the serotypes observed before and after introduction\nof the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, the recently licensed 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate\nvaccine may reduce the incidence of pneumonia with pleural effusions.\nParapneumonic pleural effusions in children are most com-\nmonly associated with pneumococcal infections, and they may\nlead to the more serious complication of empyema (10). With\nthe introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vac-\ncine (PCV7) in 2000, there has been a dramatic decrease in the\nnumber of cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the\nUnited States; however, the incidence of empyema has actually\nincreased by as much as 50% (6). To investigate the apparent\nfailure of PCV7 in reducing the incidence of pneumonia with\nempyema, it is important to investigate pneumococcal sero-\ntypes associated with parapneumonic pleural effusions ob-\ntained after PCV7 became widely used.\nWhile pneumococcal serotypes associated with pleural effu-\nsions have been studied in the past (6), most studies used\npneumococcal isolates obtained from blood or pleural \ufb02uid\ncultures of patients; however, this approach is insensitive and\nmay preferentially recover antibiotic-resistant serotypes be-\ncause most patients are treated with antibiotics and only a\nsmall percentage of cases yield positive cultures. To avoid\nthese limitations, two reports investigated pleural \ufb02uids di-\nrectly for the presence of pneumococcal capsular polysaccha-\nride (PS) with monoclonal antibodies (10, 12); however, these\nstudies were performed in England before PCV7 was widely\nused and they tested the \ufb02uids for only 13 capsular PS sero-\ntypes.\nRecently, we developed a multiplex immunoassay to detect\ncapsular PS of 36 pneumococcal serotypes on cultured isolates\n(29). The method was modi\ufb01ed to detect and quantify the\nconcentration of capsular PS directly in clinical samples such as\npleural \ufb02uids. We used this modi\ufb01ed method to identify pneu-\nmococcal serotypes in pleural \ufb02uids recently collected from a\npediatric population in central Ohio, a geographic region\nwhere PCV7 is widely used to immunize children.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPleural \ufb02uid specimens. Pleural \ufb02uid specimens examined in this study were\nobtained from children admitted to Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, Columbus,\nOH, from 2007 to 2009 with suspected bacterial pneumonia and from whom\npleural \ufb02uid was obtained as per standard of care by thoracentesis with or\nwithout chest tube placement. A laboratory diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumo-\nnia was made based on a positive blood or pleural \ufb02uid culture or a positive PCR\non pleural \ufb02uid for both the pneumococcal autolysin and pneumolysin genes\n(17a). Residual pleural \ufb02uid samples were stored at \u000170\u00b0C. A total of 49 positive\nsamples from 49 children aged 0.4 to 15 years (median, 4 years) were removed\nfrom storage, coded so as to remove patient identi\ufb01ers, and sent to the University\nof Alabama at Birmingham for serotype analysis. This study was approved by the\nNationwide Children\u2019s Hospital 1nstitutional Review Board.\nMultiplex immunoassay for capsular polysaccharide. Pleural \ufb02uid samples\nwere brought to 0.05 M EDTA, and the mixtures were boiled for 10 min (19, 22),\ndiluted 1:10 and 1:30, and subjected to a latex bead-based, multiplexed immu-\nnoassay for pneumococcal PS types by using a modi\ufb01cation of a previously\ndescribed procedure for typing of culture isolates (29). Brie\ufb02y, latex bead sets\ntreated with various red dyes recognizable by their differential \ufb02uorescence\nsignals were coated with type-speci\ufb01c pneumococcal capsular PS and mixed with\nPS-speci\ufb01c monoclonal antibodies and pleural \ufb02uid samples. Free PS in the\npleural \ufb02uid sample binds to free PS-speci\ufb01c monoclonal antibody and thus\ncompetitively inhibits speci\ufb01c binding of the free monoclonal antibody to the\nlatex beads coated with the speci\ufb01c PS. The presence of type-speci\ufb01c PS in the\npleural \ufb02uid was determined by \ufb02ow cytometry by watching for a reduction in\n\ufb02uorescence signal after washing of the beads and addition of phycoerythrin-\nconjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody. The assay has been designed\nto identify pneumococcal capsular PS of 36 serotypes, including all those in the\n23-valent pneumococcal PS vaccine.\nTo determine capsular PS concentrations in 15 pleural \ufb02uid samples, eight\n3-fold serial dilutions of the 15 samples and puri\ufb01ed PS controls containing 1\n\u0002g/ml of puri\ufb01ed capsular PS were prepared. The PS controls were purchased\nfrom ATCC (Manassas, VA) and included serotypes 1, 3, 6B, 7F, 8, 19A, and\n* Corresponding author.

The diluted samples and controls were then subjected to the multiplexed\nimmunoassay, and the capsular PS concentrations in the pleural \ufb02uids were\ndetermined by comparing the \ufb02uorescence signals of the samples at different\ndilutions to that of the standard curves constructed with the PS controls.\nMultiplex opsonophagocytosis assay. To obtain an antibiotic-free pleural\n\ufb02uid, 100 \u0002l of a pleural \ufb02uid sample containing serotype 3 PS (\u000320 \u0002g/ml) was\nloaded into a 250-\u0002l G-25-80 column. The column was eluted with normal saline,\nand the eluate was collected in 35-\u0002l fractions. The fractions were tested for\nantibiotic activity and the presence of serotype 3 PS. Fractions that were free of\nantibiotics, but with type 3 PS levels equivalent to the level in the original pleural\n\ufb02uid, were pooled and used in opsonophagocytosis assays.\nThe antibiotic-free, serotype 3-containing pleural \ufb02uid and a serotype 3 puri-\n\ufb01ed PS solution (10 \u0002g/ml) were then separately mixed with an equal volume of\na post-pneumococcal vaccination serum pool. The serum pool was prepared by\nmixing serum from 2 adults previously immunized with a 23-valent PS vaccine.\nThe serum pool and pleural \ufb02uid alone, as well as serum pool/type 3 pleural \ufb02uid\nor serum pool/type 3 puri\ufb01ed PS mixtures, were analyzed for their capacity to\nopsonize pneumococci in a multiplexed opsonophagocytosis assay using the\nHL60 human cell line as phagocytic cells, baby rabbit serum as a source of\ncomplement, and OREP3 and STREP8 as target pneumococcal strains (5, 21).\nOREP3 is an optochin-resistant pneumococcal strain expressing serotype 3 PS,\nand STREP8 is a streptomycin-resistant strain expressing serotype 8 PS. The\nopsonic index was de\ufb01ned as the serum dilution that killed 50% of target\nbacteria.\nPCR for pneumococcal serotype 19A. To identify the 19A-speci\ufb01c capsular\ngene, bacterial lysates or pleural \ufb02uid samples were diluted 10-fold in water and\nsubjected to 2 PCRs\u2014one targeting the pneumococcal wzy gene, the other\ntargeting the cpsA gene\u2014under previously described assay conditions (18). The\nprimers targeting the pneumococcal wzy gene were speci\ufb01c for the 19A serotype,\nand the primers targeting the cpsA gene were speci\ufb01c for all pneumococcal\ncapsular PS genes and used as a positive control. The reaction products were\nseparated by agarose electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and visu-\nalized under UV light.\nRESULTS\nDetermination of pneumococcal serotypes in pleural \ufb02uids.\nWhen the 49 pleural samples were directly analyzed for cap-\nsular PS with a multiplexed immunoassay, serotypes could be\nidenti\ufb01ed for 36 samples (Table 1). The most common sero-\ntype was serotype 3, accounting for 13 samples, and the next\nmost common serotypes were 1, 7F, and 19A, accounting for\nsix, seven, and seven samples, respectively. Pneumococci were\nisolated from pleural \ufb02uids of 5 patients, and the serotypes of\nthe isolates matched the serotypes identi\ufb01ed by testing the\npleural \ufb02uids directly (Table 1). The immunoassay could not\nidentify the serotypes of 13 pleural \ufb02uid samples. Since our\nimmunoassay tests for 36 serotypes, the 13 samples may ex-\npress one of the remaining 57 serotypes that were not included\nin our multiplex immunoassay. Alternatively, they may contain\nPS below the limits of detection of our immunoassay.\nWhile investigating the limits of detection of the immuno-\nassay, we found that, unlike other pneumococcal PS types\ntested, type 19A PS is heat labile. A 10-min boiling reduced the\nimmunoreactive concentration of puri\ufb01ed 19A PS to less than\n0.1% of the original concentration (Fig. 1). Following this\ndiscovery, the pleural \ufb02uid samples were reexamined for the\npresence of capsule gene locus of 19A serotype by PCR (18).\nThe PCR test con\ufb01rmed that all 7 samples previously identi\ufb01ed\nto be 19A and 4 previously nontypeable samples had DNA for\n19A capsule gene locus (data not shown).\nQuanti\ufb01cation of pneumococcal capsular PS in the pleural\n\ufb02uids. To determine the PS concentrations in pleural \ufb02uids, we\nselected 15 samples and reanalyzed them without boiling using\nstandard curves constituted with puri\ufb01ed pneumococcal PS.\nTwo samples had only about 0.1 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS; how-\never, 7 samples had capsular PS concentrations between 1 and\n10 \u0002g/ml, 6 samples had \u000410 \u0002g/ml, and one serotype 3 sample\nhad 800 \u0002g/ml of PS (Table 2).\nEffect of capsular PS in pleural \ufb02uids on opsonophagocyto-\nsis. About 0.1 to 1 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS was shown to inhibit\nthe opsonophagocytic capacity of postimmune sera from many\nvaccine recipients (15; unpublished data). Since most pleural\n\ufb02uids had more than 1 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS (Table 2), we\nhypothesized that pleural \ufb02uids could inhibit the opsonic ca-\npacity of immune sera. To directly test this possibility, we\nselected a serotype 3 pleural \ufb02uid sample containing 20 \u0002g/ml\nPS and of suf\ufb01cient volume to allow for additional testing.\nBecause this sample, similarly to other pleural \ufb02uids, contained\nantibiotics and was bactericidal (data not shown), it was sub-\njected to column chromatography as described above to re-\nmove the antibiotics. When the antibiotic-free pleural \ufb02uid\ncontaining type 3 pneumococcal PS was mixed with an immune\nserum pool with a high opsonic index against both serotypes 3\nFIG. 1.

The\nopsonic index of the serum pool to serotype 3 could be com-\npletely neutralized with 5 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS of serotype 3\n(left panel). Thus, the pleural \ufb02uids of patients with pleural\neffusions have suf\ufb01cient capsular PS to neutralize type-speci\ufb01c\nanticapsular antibodies in vitro.\nDISCUSSION\nPrevious studies have shown that pneumococcal pneumonia\nwith pleural effusion is associated with a limited number of\nserotypes. Table 3 summarizes 9 published studies of pneumo-\ncoccal pneumonia with pleural effusion and lists the \ufb01ve most\ncommon pneumococcal serotypes isolated in culture. 1t is pos-\nsible that these serotype prevalence studies based on typing of\nculture isolates may be biased toward serotypes that express\nantibiotic resistance and thus are more likely to be recovered in\nculture. This is because many patients with suspected commu-\nnity-acquired pneumonia are treated as outpatients with oral\nantibiotics. Amoxicillin alone or in combination with azithro-\nmycin is commonly used to manage pediatric patients without\nsevere pneumonia and without underlying disease. Of those\npatients who fail oral outpatient therapy and go on to develop\npleural effusion and require hospitalization, only a small per-\ncentage, typically 10 to 20% in most studies, yield culture\nisolates. There are reported differences in antibiotic resistance\namong serotypes.\nWith our combination of multiplex immunoassay and 19A\nPCR performed directly on pleural \ufb02uid, we were able to\ndetermine the serotype in 40 of 49 (82%) cases of pneumo-\ncoccal pneumonia with pleural effusion. The 4 most common\nserotypes in our study, accounting for 75% of typeable cases,\nwere serotypes 1, 3, 7F, and 19A. We cannot draw conclusions\non how the 9 nontypeable pleural \ufb02uids might have impacted\nthe serotype distribution in our study. Notwithstanding, these\nsame 4 serotypes were also found to be common in another\nrecent study of pneumococcal pneumonia (Table 3) (6), but\nnot all were commonly represented in studies where samples\nwere collected before 2001 (Table 3). These observations sug-\ngest that serotype prevalence data based on testing of culture\nisolates may not be biased toward isolates that express antibi-\notic resistance.\nFurthermore, all 5 of the culture-positive isolates in our\nstudy were very susceptible to the beta-lactam agents tested,\nincluding penicillin, amoxicillin, and ceftriaxone, with MICs in\nthe 0.01- to 0.04-\u0002g/ml range. Four of \ufb01ve isolates were also\nsusceptible to erythromycin, with MICs of 0.12 \u0002g/ml. Clearly,\nother factors such as dose and length of oral antibiotic therapy,\nhost immune response, and virulence of the serotype are im-\nportant in determining which patients develop effusion and\nwhich have positive cultures.\nThe multiplexed immunoassay for typing of pneumococcal\nPS in pleural \ufb02uids required heat pretreatment to remove\ninterfering substances; however, during this processing, we dis-\ncovered that 19A PS is quite heat labile whereas other PS\ntypes, including 19F, are heat stable. This selective heat lability\nis interesting since 19A and 19F PSs are structurally very sim-\nilar and a previous study noted that both 19A and 19F PSs were\nheat labile (25). Of note is that 6A and 6B PSs are very similar\nin structure but differ in hydrolytic stability (4, 30). 1t is possible\nthat only the epitope recognized with the 19A-speci\ufb01c mono-\nclonal antibody used in our assay is heat labile and that the\nheat lability may not be observed with a different 19A-speci\ufb01c\nmonoclonal antibody. Additional studies are being performed\nto investigate these possibilities. Heat pretreatment is widely\nused to reduce interfering substances in serum or urine sam-\nples before subjecting them to immunoassay (9, 19, 22, 23), and\none should be aware that heating may reduce the apparent\nconcentration of certain pneumococcal capsule types.\nWe also found that the level of capsular PS in pleural \ufb02uid\nis generally greater than 1 \u0002g/ml, which is suf\ufb01cient to neutral-\nize the opsonic capacity of anticapsular antibodies in vitro. 1t is\npossible that free pneumococcal capsular PS in pleural effu-\nsions in vivo can neutralize type-speci\ufb01c anticapsular antibod-\nies and thus promote the replication of pneumococci. Neutral-\nization of opsonic capacity by free capsular PS may be an\nimportant mechanism of pathogenesis of pleural effusion and\nprogression to empyema. This mechanism may also apply to\ninfections involving limited tissue spaces such as otitis media,\nand it should be interesting to determine the concentration of\ncapsular PS found in ear \ufb02uids from patients with otitis media.\nPleural effusion is a complication of pneumococcal pneumo-\nnia, and serotype prevalence among cases of pleural effusions\nFIG. 2.

CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\nmay re\ufb02ect serotype prevalence in all cases of pneumococcal\npneumonia. We believe that serotypes 7F and 19A may be such\nserotypes. These two serotypes have become more common\namong cases of 1PD following the use of PCV7 as a part of a\ngeneral shift of serotypes (1, 14, 16). Also, these serotypes have\nbecome noticeable among studies of pneumococcal pneumo-\nnia with empyema performed in the post-PCV7 era but not\namong studies performed before introduction of PCV7 (Table\n3). 1nterestingly, serotype 14 was very common, accounting for\n12 to 29% of cases in 6 separate studies before introduction of\nPCV7 (Table 3), but it has not been observed in three studies\nperformed after introduction of PCV7 (6). Similarly, none of\nthe pleural \ufb02uid samples collected in the 2007-2009 time pe-\nriod of our study were serotype 14. These data suggest that\nPCV7 has been effective in preventing pneumonia with pleural\neffusions due to serotype 14 pneumococci.\nPCV7 does not contain serotypes 1 and 3, and it would not\nhave affected their prevalence; however, the incidence of pneu-\nmonia with pleural effusions associated with serotypes 1 and 3\nhas been disproportionately high compared to their pneumo-\nnia incidence in many studies (Table 3) (11, 24). Serotype 3 has\nbeen known to produce high levels of capsule, and the level of\ncapsular PS may be important in pathogenesis of pneumonia\nwith pleural effusions, as discussed above. Perhaps serotype 3\npneumococci are prone to causing pleural effusions because\nthey can produce high and protective concentrations of capsu-\nlar PS, overcome host immunity, and proliferate better than\nother pneumococcal serotypes. 1nterestingly, the prevalence of\nserotype 3 is disproportionately higher in otitis media than in 1PD in many different geographic regions (20). Perhaps the\npleural cavity and the middle ear are body cavities conducive\nfor the high-capsule-producing serotypes.\nSerotype 1 pneumococcus has been an uncommon (only 1 to\n2%) cause of 1PD since the 1960s (11). Yet, it is the primary\nserotype associated with empyema, accounting for 21 to 67%\nfor 9 studies done in several countries from 1993 until 2007\n(Table 3). One may be able to understand this remarkable\nclinical observation with recent discoveries of immunological\nproperties of zwitterionic PS (2, 8). Zwitterionic PS has both\npositive and negative charges in its repeating unit, whereas\nmost bacterial capsular PSs have only either neutral or nega-\ntive charges. Serotype 1 PS is zwitterionic, since its repeating\nunit has one positively charged amino group and two nega-\ntively charged groups, and it has been shown to stimulate T\ncells (28) and induce intra-abdominal abscess in animal models\n(27). 1nduction of abdominal abscess was not unique to sero-\ntype 1 PS because zwitterionic PSs from other bacteria can\ninduce abscess formation (27). These biological properties\nwould permit serotype 1 pneumococci to form abscesses and to\nenhance development of empyema. 1n fact, serotype 1 has\nbeen clinically associated with complicated clinical presenta-\ntions among empyema cases (26).\nWhile PCV7 appears to have been effective in reducing\nempyema by serotype 14, our study con\ufb01rms that PCV7 would\nbe inadequate against current cases of pneumococcal empy-\nema since the vaccine does not cover the serotypes responsible\nfor the majority of cases. Since the recently approved PCV13\nincludes the four main detected serotypes causing pleural ef-\nfusions, 1, 3, 7F, and 19A, it may be useful in reducing the\nincidence of pneumococcal empyema. Future studies should\nbe done to monitor the effect of the new vaccine on empyema\namong children.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe work was supported by Public Health Service grant AI-31473\nfrom the National 1nstitutes of Health to M.H.N.\nThe University of Alabama at Birmingham owns the intellectual\nproperty rights to the monoclonal antibodies described in this work.\nM.H.N. and J.Y. are employees of the University of Alabama.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Because the \ufb02uids had to be heated to\nremove nonspeci\ufb01c reactivity before being tested in the immunoassay and type 19A PS is heat labile, the pleural\n\ufb02uid samples were also tested for serotype 19A capsule gene locus by PCR. Use of the multiplex immunoassay\ncombined with type-speci\ufb01c 19A PCR allowed for serotype determination on 40 of 49 pleural \ufb02uids. Pneumo-\ncoccal pneumonia with pleural effusion was associated with a limited number of serotypes, with types 1, 3, 7F/A,\nand 19A accounting for 75% of the typeable cases. The concentration of capsular PS in the pleural \ufb02uids was\noften greater than 1 \u0001g/ml and suf\ufb01cient to inhibit the opsonic capacity of sera from individuals who had\nreceived the 23-valent pneumococcal PS vaccine. Based on the serotypes observed before and after introduction\nof the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, the recently licensed 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate\nvaccine may reduce the incidence of pneumonia with pleural effusions.\nParapneumonic pleural effusions in children are most com-\nmonly associated with pneumococcal infections, and they may\nlead to the more serious complication of empyema (10). With\nthe introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vac-\ncine (PCV7) in 2000, there has been a dramatic decrease in the\nnumber of cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the\nUnited States; however, the incidence of empyema has actually\nincreased by as much as 50% (6). To investigate the apparent\nfailure of PCV7 in reducing the incidence of pneumonia with\nempyema, it is important to investigate pneumococcal sero-\ntypes associated with parapneumonic pleural effusions ob-\ntained after PCV7 became widely used.\nWhile pneumococcal serotypes associated with pleural effu-\nsions have been studied in the past (6), most studies used\npneumococcal isolates obtained from blood or pleural \ufb02uid\ncultures of patients; however, this approach is insensitive and\nmay preferentially recover antibiotic-resistant serotypes be-\ncause most patients are treated with antibiotics and only a\nsmall percentage of cases yield positive cultures. To avoid\nthese limitations, two reports investigated pleural \ufb02uids di-\nrectly for the presence of pneumococcal capsular polysaccha-\nride (PS) with monoclonal antibodies (10, 12); however, these\nstudies were performed in England before PCV7 was widely\nused and they tested the \ufb02uids for only 13 capsular PS sero-\ntypes.\nRecently, we developed a multiplex immunoassay to detect\ncapsular PS of 36 pneumococcal serotypes on cultured isolates\n(29). The method was modi\ufb01ed to detect and quantify the\nconcentration of capsular PS directly in clinical samples such as\npleural \ufb02uids. We used this modi\ufb01ed method to identify pneu-\nmococcal serotypes in pleural \ufb02uids recently collected from a\npediatric population in central Ohio, a geographic region\nwhere PCV7 is widely used to immunize children.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPleural \ufb02uid specimens. Pleural \ufb02uid specimens examined in this study were\nobtained from children admitted to Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, Columbus,\nOH, from 2007 to 2009 with suspected bacterial pneumonia and from whom\npleural \ufb02uid was obtained as per standard of care by thoracentesis with or\nwithout chest tube placement. A laboratory diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumo-\nnia was made based on a positive blood or pleural \ufb02uid culture or a positive PCR\non pleural \ufb02uid for both the pneumococcal autolysin and pneumolysin genes\n(17a). Residual pleural \ufb02uid samples were stored at \u000170\u00b0C. A total of 49 positive\nsamples from 49 children aged 0.4 to 15 years (median, 4 years) were removed\nfrom storage, coded so as to remove patient identi\ufb01ers, and sent to the University\nof Alabama at Birmingham for serotype analysis. This study was approved by the\nNationwide Children\u2019s Hospital Institutional Review Board.\nMultiplex immunoassay for capsular polysaccharide. Pleural \ufb02uid samples\nwere brought to 0.05 M EDTA, and the mixtures were boiled for 10 min (19, 22),\ndiluted 1:10 and 1:30, and subjected to a latex bead-based, multiplexed immu-\nnoassay for pneumococcal PS types by using a modi\ufb01cation of a previously\ndescribed procedure for typing of culture isolates (29). Brie\ufb02y, latex bead sets\ntreated with various red dyes recognizable by their differential \ufb02uorescence\nsignals were coated with type-speci\ufb01c pneumococcal capsular PS and mixed with\nPS-speci\ufb01c monoclonal antibodies and pleural \ufb02uid samples. Free PS in the\npleural \ufb02uid sample binds to free PS-speci\ufb01c monoclonal antibody and thus\ncompetitively inhibits speci\ufb01c binding of the free monoclonal antibody to the\nlatex beads coated with the speci\ufb01c PS. The presence of type-speci\ufb01c PS in the\npleural \ufb02uid was determined by \ufb02ow cytometry by watching for a reduction in\n\ufb02uorescence signal after washing of the beads and addition of phycoerythrin-\nconjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody. The assay has been designed\nto identify pneumococcal capsular PS of 36 serotypes, including all those in the\n23-valent pneumococcal PS vaccine.\nTo determine capsular PS concentrations in 15 pleural \ufb02uid samples, eight\n3-fold serial dilutions of the 15 samples and puri\ufb01ed PS controls containing 1\n\u0002g/ml of puri\ufb01ed capsular PS were prepared. The PS controls were purchased\nfrom ATCC (Manassas, VA) and included serotypes 1, 3, 6B, 7F, 8, 19A, and\n* Corresponding author.

The diluted samples and controls were then subjected to the multiplexed\nimmunoassay, and the capsular PS concentrations in the pleural \ufb02uids were\ndetermined by comparing the \ufb02uorescence signals of the samples at different\ndilutions to that of the standard curves constructed with the PS controls.\nMultiplex opsonophagocytosis assay. To obtain an antibiotic-free pleural\n\ufb02uid, 100 \u0002l of a pleural \ufb02uid sample containing serotype 3 PS (\u000320 \u0002g/ml) was\nloaded into a 250-\u0002l G-25-80 column. The column was eluted with normal saline,\nand the eluate was collected in 35-\u0002l fractions. The fractions were tested for\nantibiotic activity and the presence of serotype 3 PS. Fractions that were free of\nantibiotics, but with type 3 PS levels equivalent to the level in the original pleural\n\ufb02uid, were pooled and used in opsonophagocytosis assays.\nThe antibiotic-free, serotype 3-containing pleural \ufb02uid and a serotype 3 puri-\n\ufb01ed PS solution (10 \u0002g/ml) were then separately mixed with an equal volume of\na post-pneumococcal vaccination serum pool. The serum pool was prepared by\nmixing serum from 2 adults previously immunized with a 23-valent PS vaccine.\nThe serum pool and pleural \ufb02uid alone, as well as serum pool/type 3 pleural \ufb02uid\nor serum pool/type 3 puri\ufb01ed PS mixtures, were analyzed for their capacity to\nopsonize pneumococci in a multiplexed opsonophagocytosis assay using the\nHL60 human cell line as phagocytic cells, baby rabbit serum as a source of\ncomplement, and OREP3 and STREP8 as target pneumococcal strains (5, 21).\nOREP3 is an optochin-resistant pneumococcal strain expressing serotype 3 PS,\nand STREP8 is a streptomycin-resistant strain expressing serotype 8 PS.

To identify the 19A-speci\ufb01c capsular\ngene, bacterial lysates or pleural \ufb02uid samples were diluted 10-fold in water and\nsubjected to 2 PCRs\u2014one targeting the pneumococcal wzy gene, the other\ntargeting the cpsA gene\u2014under previously described assay conditions (18). The\nprimers targeting the pneumococcal wzy gene were speci\ufb01c for the 19A serotype,\nand the primers targeting the cpsA gene were speci\ufb01c for all pneumococcal\ncapsular PS genes and used as a positive control. The reaction products were\nseparated by agarose electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and visu-\nalized under UV light.\nRESULTS\nDetermination of pneumococcal serotypes in pleural \ufb02uids.\nWhen the 49 pleural samples were directly analyzed for cap-\nsular PS with a multiplexed immunoassay, serotypes could be\nidenti\ufb01ed for 36 samples (Table 1). The most common sero-\ntype was serotype 3, accounting for 13 samples, and the next\nmost common serotypes were 1, 7F, and 19A, accounting for\nsix, seven, and seven samples, respectively. Pneumococci were\nisolated from pleural \ufb02uids of 5 patients, and the serotypes of\nthe isolates matched the serotypes identi\ufb01ed by testing the\npleural \ufb02uids directly (Table 1). The immunoassay could not\nidentify the serotypes of 13 pleural \ufb02uid samples. Since our\nimmunoassay tests for 36 serotypes, the 13 samples may ex-\npress one of the remaining 57 serotypes that were not included\nin our multiplex immunoassay. Alternatively, they may contain\nPS below the limits of detection of our immunoassay.\nWhile investigating the limits of detection of the immuno-\nassay, we found that, unlike other pneumococcal PS types\ntested, type 19A PS is heat labile. A 10-min boiling reduced the\nimmunoreactive concentration of puri\ufb01ed 19A PS to less than\n0.1% of the original concentration (Fig. 1). Following this\ndiscovery, the pleural \ufb02uid samples were reexamined for the\npresence of capsule gene locus of 19A serotype by PCR (18).\nThe PCR test con\ufb01rmed that all 7 samples previously identi\ufb01ed\nto be 19A and 4 previously nontypeable samples had DNA for\n19A capsule gene locus (data not shown).\nQuanti\ufb01cation of pneumococcal capsular PS in the pleural\n\ufb02uids. To determine the PS concentrations in pleural \ufb02uids, we\nselected 15 samples and reanalyzed them without boiling using\nstandard curves constituted with puri\ufb01ed pneumococcal PS.\nTwo samples had only about 0.1 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS; how-\never, 7 samples had capsular PS concentrations between 1 and\n10 \u0002g/ml, 6 samples had \u000410 \u0002g/ml, and one serotype 3 sample\nhad 800 \u0002g/ml of PS (Table 2).\nEffect of capsular PS in pleural \ufb02uids on opsonophagocyto-\nsis. About 0.1 to 1 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS was shown to inhibit\nthe opsonophagocytic capacity of postimmune sera from many\nvaccine recipients (15; unpublished data). Since most pleural\n\ufb02uids had more than 1 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS (Table 2), we\nhypothesized that pleural \ufb02uids could inhibit the opsonic ca-\npacity of immune sera. To directly test this possibility, we\nselected a serotype 3 pleural \ufb02uid sample containing 20 \u0002g/ml\nPS and of suf\ufb01cient volume to allow for additional testing.\nBecause this sample, similarly to other pleural \ufb02uids, contained\nantibiotics and was bactericidal (data not shown), it was sub-\njected to column chromatography as described above to re-\nmove the antibiotics. When the antibiotic-free pleural \ufb02uid\ncontaining type 3 pneumococcal PS was mixed with an immune\nserum pool with a high opsonic index against both serotypes 3\nFIG. 1.

The\nopsonic index of the serum pool to serotype 3 could be com-\npletely neutralized with 5 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS of serotype 3\n(left panel). Thus, the pleural \ufb02uids of patients with pleural\neffusions have suf\ufb01cient capsular PS to neutralize type-speci\ufb01c\nanticapsular antibodies in vitro.\nDISCUSSION\nPrevious studies have shown that pneumococcal pneumonia\nwith pleural effusion is associated with a limited number of\nserotypes. Table 3 summarizes 9 published studies of pneumo-\ncoccal pneumonia with pleural effusion and lists the \ufb01ve most\ncommon pneumococcal serotypes isolated in culture. It is pos-\nsible that these serotype prevalence studies based on typing of\nculture isolates may be biased toward serotypes that express\nantibiotic resistance and thus are more likely to be recovered in\nculture. This is because many patients with suspected commu-\nnity-acquired pneumonia are treated as outpatients with oral\nantibiotics. Amoxicillin alone or in combination with azithro-\nmycin is commonly used to manage pediatric patients without\nsevere pneumonia and without underlying disease. Of those\npatients who fail oral outpatient therapy and go on to develop\npleural effusion and require hospitalization, only a small per-\ncentage, typically 10 to 20% in most studies, yield culture\nisolates. There are reported differences in antibiotic resistance\namong serotypes.\nWith our combination of multiplex immunoassay and 19A\nPCR performed directly on pleural \ufb02uid, we were able to\ndetermine the serotype in 40 of 49 (82%) cases of pneumo-\ncoccal pneumonia with pleural effusion. The 4 most common\nserotypes in our study, accounting for 75% of typeable cases,\nwere serotypes 1, 3, 7F, and 19A. We camot draw conclusions\non how the 9 nontypeable pleural \ufb02uids might have impacted\nthe serotype distribution in our study. Notwithstanding, these\nsame 4 serotypes were also found to be common in another\nrecent study of pneumococcal pneumonia (Table 3) (6), but\nnot all were commonly represented in studies where samples\nwere collected before 2001 (Table 3). These observations sug-\ngest that serotype prevalence data based on testing of culture\nisolates may not be biased toward isolates that express antibi-\notic resistance.\nFurthermore, all 5 of the culture-positive isolates in our\nstudy were very susceptible to the beta-lactam agents tested,\nincluding penicillin, amoxicillin, and ceftriaxone, with MICs in\nthe 0.01- to 0.04-\u0002g/ml range. Four of \ufb01ve isolates were also\nsusceptible to erythromycin, with MICs of 0.12 \u0002g/ml. Clearly,\nother factors such as dose and length of oral antibiotic therapy,\nhost immune response, and virulence of the serotype are im-\nportant in determining which patients develop effusion and\nwhich have positive cultures.\nThe multiplexed immunoassay for typing of pneumococcal\nPS in pleural \ufb02uids required heat pretreatment to remove\ninterfering substances; however, during this processing, we dis-\ncovered that 19A PS is quite heat labile whereas other PS\ntypes, including 19F, are heat stable. This selective heat lability\nis interesting since 19A and 19F PSs are structurally very sim-\nilar and a previous study noted that both 19A and 19F PSs were\nheat labile (25). Of note is that 6A and 6B PSs are very similar\nin structure but differ in hydrolytic stability (4, 30). It is possible\nthat only the epitope recognized with the 19A-speci\ufb01c mono-\nclonal antibody used in our assay is heat labile and that the\nheat lability may not be observed with a different 19A-speci\ufb01c\nmonoclonal antibody. Additional studies are being performed\nto investigate these possibilities. Heat pretreatment is widely\nused to reduce interfering substances in serum or urine sam-\nples before subjecting them to immunoassay (9, 19, 22, 23), and\none should be aware that heating may reduce the apparent\nconcentration of certain pneumococcal capsule types.\nWe also found that the level of capsular PS in pleural \ufb02uid\nis generally greater than 1 \u0002g/ml, which is suf\ufb01cient to neutral-\nize the opsonic capacity of anticapsular antibodies in vitro. It is\npossible that free pneumococcal capsular PS in pleural effu-\nsions in vivo can neutralize type-speci\ufb01c anticapsular antibod-\nies and thus promote the replication of pneumococci. Neutral-\nization of opsonic capacity by free capsular PS may be an\nimportant mechanism of pathogenesis of pleural effusion and\nprogression to empyema. This mechanism may also apply to\ninfections involving limited tissue spaces such as otitis media,\nand it should be interesting to determine the concentration of\ncapsular PS found in ear \ufb02uids from patients with otitis media.\nPleural effusion is a complication of pneumococcal pneumo-\nnia, and serotype prevalence among cases of pleural effusions\nFIG. 2.

The serum\npool had high opsonic activity with respect to both serotypes 3 and 8.\nPleural \ufb02uid containing serotype 3 PS and puri\ufb01ed type 3 PS (5 \u0002g/ml)\nwas used in all experiments.\nTABLE 2.

CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\nmay re\ufb02ect serotype prevalence in all cases of pneumococcal\npneumonia. We believe that serotypes 7F and 19A may be such\nserotypes. These two serotypes have become more common\namong cases of IPD following the use of PCV7 as a part of a\ngeneral shift of serotypes (1, 14, 16). Also, these serotypes have\nbecome noticeable among studies of pneumococcal pneumo-\nnia with empyema performed in the post-PCV7 era but not\namong studies performed before introduction of PCV7 (Table\n3). Interestingly, serotype 14 was very common, accounting for\n12 to 29% of cases in 6 separate studies before introduction of\nPCV7 (Table 3), but it has not been observed in three studies\nperformed after introduction of PCV7 (6). Similarly, none of\nthe pleural \ufb02uid samples collected in the 2007-2009 time pe-\nriod of our study were serotype 14. These data suggest that\nPCV7 has been effective in preventing pneumonia with pleural\neffusions due to serotype 14 pneumococci.\nPCV7 does not contain serotypes 1 and 3, and it would not\nhave affected their prevalence; however, the incidence of pneu-\nmonia with pleural effusions associated with serotypes 1 and 3\nhas been disproportionately high compared to their pneumo-\nnia incidence in many studies (Table 3) (11, 24). Serotype 3 has\nbeen known to produce high levels of capsule, and the level of\ncapsular PS may be important in pathogenesis of pneumonia\nwith pleural effusions, as discussed above. Perhaps serotype 3\npneumococci are prone to causing pleural effusions because\nthey can produce high and protective concentrations of capsu-\nlar PS, overcome host immunity, and proliferate better than\nother pneumococcal serotypes. Interestingly, the prevalence of\nserotype 3 is disproportionately higher in otitis media than in\nIPD in many different geographic regions (20). Perhaps the\npleural cavity and the middle ear are body cavities conducive\nfor the high-capsule-producing serotypes.\nSerotype 1 pneumococcus has been an uncommon (only 1 to\n2%) cause of IPD since the 1960s (11). Yet, it is the primary\nserotype associated with empyema, accounting for 21 to 67%\nfor 9 studies done in several countries from 1993 until 2007\n(Table 3). One may be able to understand this remarkable\nclinical observation with recent discoveries of immunological\nproperties of zwitterionic PS (2, 8). Zwitterionic PS has both\npositive and negative charges in its repeating unit, whereas\nmost bacterial capsular PSs have only either neutral or nega-\ntive charges. Serotype 1 PS is zwitterionic, since its repeating\nunit has one positively charged amino group and two nega-\ntively charged groups, and it has been shown to stimulate T\ncells (28) and induce intra-abdominal abscess in animal models\n(27). Induction of abdominal abscess was not unique to sero-\ntype 1 PS because zwitterionic PSs from other bacteria can\ninduce abscess formation (27). These biological properties\nwould permit serotype 1 pneumococci to form abscesses and to\nenhance development of empyema. In fact, serotype 1 has\nbeen clinically associated with complicated clinical presenta-\ntions among empyema cases (26).\nWhile PCV7 appears to have been effective in reducing\nempyema by serotype 14, our study con\ufb01rms that PCV7 would\nbe inadequate against current cases of pneumococcal empy-\nema since the vaccine does not cover the serotypes responsible\nfor the majority of cases. Since the recently approved PCV13\nincludes the four main detected serotypes causing pleural ef-\nfusions, 1, 3, 7F, and 19A, it may be useful in reducing the\nincidence of pneumococcal empyema. Future studies should\nbe done to monitor the effect of the new vaccine on empyema\namong children.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe work was supported by Public Health Service grant AI-31473\nfrom the National Institutes of Health to M.H.N.\nThe University of Alabama at Birmingham owns the intellectual\nproperty rights to the monoclonal antibodies described in this work.\nM.H.N. and J.Y. are employees of the University of Alabama.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Because the \ufb02uids had to be heated to\nremove nonspeci\ufb01c reactivity before being tested in the immunoassay and type 19A PS is heat labile, the pleural\n\ufb02uid samples were also tested for serotype 19A capsule gene locus by PCR. Use of the multiplex immunoassay\ncombined with type-speci\ufb01c 19A PCR allowed for serotype determination on 40 of 49 pleural \ufb02uids. Pneumo-\ncoccal pneumonia with pleural effusion was associated with a limited number of serotypes, with types 1, 3, 7F/A,\nand 19A accounting for 75% of the typeable cases. The concentration of capsular PS in the pleural \ufb02uids was\noften greater than 1 \u0001g/ml and suf\ufb01cient to inhibit the opsonic capacity of sera from individuals who had\nreceived the 23-valent pneumococcal PS vaccine. Based on the serotypes observed before and after introduction\nof the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, the recently licensed 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate\nvaccine may reduce the incidence of pneumonia with pleural effusions.\nParapneumonic pleural effusions in children are most com-\nmonly associated with pneumococcal infections, and they may\nlead to the more serious complication of empyema (10). With\nthe introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vac-\ncine (PCV7) in 2000, there has been a dramatic decrease in the\nnumber of cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the\nUnited States; however, the incidence of empyema has actually\nincreased by as much as 50% (6). To investigate the apparent\nfailure of PCV7 in reducing the incidence of pneumonia with\nempyema, it is important to investigate pneumococcal sero-\ntypes associated with parapneumonic pleural effusions ob-\ntained after PCV7 became widely used.\nWhile pneumococcal serotypes associated with pleural effu-\nsions have been studied in the past (6), most studies used\npneumococcal isolates obtained from blood or pleural \ufb02uid\ncultures of patients; however, this approach is insensitive and\nmay preferentially recover antibiotic-resistant serotypes be-\ncause most patients are treated with antibiotics and only a\nsmall percentage of cases yield positive cultures. To avoid\nthese limitations, two reports investigated pleural \ufb02uids di-\nrectly for the presence of pneumococcal capsular polysaccha-\nride (PS) with monoclonal antibodies (10, 12); however, these\nstudies were performed in England before PCV7 was widely\nused and they tested the \ufb02uids for only 13 capsular PS sero-\ntypes.\nRecently, we developed a multiplex immunoassay to detect\ncapsular PS of 36 pneumococcal serotypes on cultured isolates\n(29). The method was modi\ufb01ed to detect and quantify the\nconcentration of capsular PS directly in clinical samples such as\npleural \ufb02uids. We used this modi\ufb01ed method to identify pneu-\nmococcal serotypes in pleural \ufb02uids recently collected from a\npediatric population in central Ohio, a geographic region\nwhere PCV7 is widely used to immunize children.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPleural \ufb02uid specimens. Pleural \ufb02uid specimens examined in this study were\nobtained from children admitted to Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, Columbus,\nOH, from 2007 to 2009 with suspected bacterial pneumonia and from whom\npleural \ufb02uid was obtained as per standard of care by thoracentesis with or\nwithout chest tube placement. A laboratory diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumo-\nnia was made based on a positive blood or pleural \ufb02uid culture or a positive PCR\non pleural \ufb02uid for both the pneumococcal autolysin and pneumolysin genes\n(17a). Residual pleural \ufb02uid samples were stored at \u000170\u00b0C. A total of 49 positive\nsamples from 49 children aged 0.4 to 15 years (median, 4 years) were removed\nfrom storage, coded so as to remove patient identi\ufb01ers, and sent to the University\nof Alabama at Birmingham for serotype analysis. This study was approved by the\nNationwide Children\u2019s Hospital Institutional Review Board.\nMultiplex immunoassay for capsular polysaccharide. Pleural \ufb02uid samples\nwere brought to 0.05 M EDTA, and the mixtures were boiled for 10 min (19, 22),\ndiluted 1:10 and 1:30, and subjected to a latex bead-based, multiplexed immu-\nnoassay for pneumococcal PS types by using a modi\ufb01cation of a previously\ndescribed procedure for typing of culture isolates (29). Brie\ufb02y, latex bead sets\ntreated with various red dyes recognizable by their differential \ufb02uorescence\nsignals were coated with type-speci\ufb01c pneumococcal capsular PS and mixed with\nPS-speci\ufb01c monoclonal antibodies and pleural \ufb02uid samples. Free PS in the\npleural \ufb02uid sample binds to free PS-speci\ufb01c monoclonal antibody and thus\ncompetitively inhibits speci\ufb01c binding of the free monoclonal antibody to the\nlatex beads coated with the speci\ufb01c PS. The presence of type-speci\ufb01c PS in the\npleural \ufb02uid was determined by \ufb02ow cytometry by watching for a reduction in\n\ufb02uorescence signal after washing of the beads and addition of phycoerythrin-\nconjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody. The assay has been designed\nto identify pneumococcal capsular PS of 36 serotypes, including all those in the\n23-valent pneumococcal PS vaccine.\nTo determine capsular PS concentrations in 15 pleural \ufb02uid samples, eight\n3-fold serial dilutions of the 15 samples and puri\ufb01ed PS controls containing 1\n\u0002g/ml of puri\ufb01ed capsular PS were prepared. The PS controls were purchased\nfrom ATCC (Manassas, VA) and included serotypes 1, 3, 6B, 7F, 8, 19A, and\n* Corresponding author.

The diluted samples and controls were then subjected to the multiplexed\nimmunoassay, and the capsular PS concentrations in the pleural \ufb02uids were\ndetermined by comparing the \ufb02uorescence signals of the samples at different\ndilutions to that of the standard curves constructed with the PS controls.\nMultiplex opsonophagocytosis assay. To obtain an antibiotic-free pleural\n\ufb02uid, 100 \u0002l of a pleural \ufb02uid sample containing serotype 3 PS (\u000320 \u0002g/ml) was\nloaded into a 250-\u0002l G-25-80 column. The column was eluted with normal saline,\nand the eluate was collected in 35-\u0002l fractions. The fractions were tested for\nantibiotic activity and the presence of serotype 3 PS. Fractions that were free of\nantibiotics, but with type 3 PS levels equivalent to the level in the original pleural\n\ufb02uid, were pooled and used in opsonophagocytosis assays.\nThe antibiotic-free, serotype 3-containing pleural \ufb02uid and a serotype 3 puri-\n\ufb01ed PS solution (10 \u0002g/ml) were then separately mixed with an equal volume of\na post-pneumococcal vaccination serum pool. The serum pool was prepared by\nmixing serum from 2 adults previously immunized with a 23-valent PS vaccine.\nThe serum pool and pleural \ufb02uid alone, as well as serum pool/type 3 pleural \ufb02uid\nor serum pool/type 3 puri\ufb01ed PS mixtures, were analyzed for their capacity to\nopsonize pneumococci in a multiplexed opsonophagocytosis assay using the\nHL60 human cell line as phagocytic cells, baby rabbit serum as a source of\ncomplement, and OREP3 and STREP8 as target pneumococcal strains (5, 21).\nOREP3 is an optochin-resistant pneumococcal strain expressing serotype 3 PS,\nand STREP8 is a streptomycin-resistant strain expressing serotype 8 PS. The\nopsonic index was de\ufb01ned as the serum dilution that killed 50% of target\nbacteria.\nPCR for pneumococcal serotype 19A. To identify the 19A-speci\ufb01c capsular\ngene, bacterial lysates or pleural \ufb02uid samples were diluted 10-fold in water and\nsubjected to 2 PCRs\u2014one targeting the pneumococcal wzy gene, the other\ntargeting the cpsA gene\u2014under previously described assay conditions (18). The\nprimers targeting the pneumococcal wzy gene were speci\ufb01c for the 19A serotype,\nand the primers targeting the cpsA gene were speci\ufb01c for all pneumococcal\ncapsular PS genes and used as a positive control. The reaction products were\nseparated by agarose electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and visu-\nalized under UV light.\nRESULTS\nDetermination of pneumococcal serotypes in pleural \ufb02uids.\nWhen the 49 pleural samples were directly analyzed for cap-\nsular PS with a multiplexed immunoassay, serotypes could be\nidenti\ufb01ed for 36 samples (Table 1). The most common sero-\ntype was serotype 3, accounting for 13 samples, and the next\nmost common serotypes were 1, 7F, and 19A, accounting for\nsix, seven, and seven samples, respectively. Pneumococci were\nisolated from pleural \ufb02uids of 5 patients, and the serotypes of\nthe isolates matched the serotypes identi\ufb01ed by testing the\npleural \ufb02uids directly (Table 1). The immunoassay could not\nidentify the serotypes of 13 pleural \ufb02uid samples. Since our\nimmunoassay tests for 36 serotypes, the 13 samples may ex-\npress one of the remaining 57 serotypes that were not included\nin our multiplex immunoassay. Alternatively, they may contain\nPS below the limits of detection of our immunoassay.\nWhile investigating the limits of detection of the immuno-\nassay, we found that, unlike other pneumococcal PS types\ntested, type 19A PS is heat labile. A 10-min boiling reduced the\nimmunoreactive concentration of puri\ufb01ed 19A PS to less than\n0.1% of the original concentration (Fig. 1). Following this\ndiscovery, the pleural \ufb02uid samples were reexamined for the\npresence of capsule gene locus of 19A serotype by PCR (18).\nThe PCR test con\ufb01rmed that all 7 samples previously identi\ufb01ed\nto be 19A and 4 previously nontypeable samples had DNA for\n19A capsule gene locus (data not shown).\nQuanti\ufb01cation of pneumococcal capsular PS in the pleural\n\ufb02uids. To determine the PS concentrations in pleural \ufb02uids, we\nselected 15 samples and reanalyzed them without boiling using\nstandard curves constituted with puri\ufb01ed pneumococcal PS.\nTwo samples had only about 0.1 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS; how-\never, 7 samples had capsular PS concentrations between 1 and\n10 \u0002g/ml, 6 samples had \u000410 \u0002g/ml, and one serotype 3 sample\nhad 800 \u0002g/ml of PS (Table 2).\nEffect of capsular PS in pleural \ufb02uids on opsonophagocyto-\nsis. About 0.1 to 1 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS was shown to inhibit\nthe opsonophagocytic capacity of postimmune sera from many\nvaccine recipients (15; unpublished data). Since most pleural\n\ufb02uids had more than 1 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS (Table 2), we\nhypothesized that pleural \ufb02uids could inhibit the opsonic ca-\npacity of immune sera. To directly test this possibility, we\nselected a serotype 3 pleural \ufb02uid sample containing 20 \u0002g/ml\nPS and of suf\ufb01cient volume to allow for additional testing.\nBecause this sample, similarly to other pleural \ufb02uids, contained\nantibiotics and was bactericidal (data not shown), it was sub-\njected to column chromatography as described above to re-\nmove the antibiotics. When the antibiotic-free pleural \ufb02uid\ncontaining type 3 pneumococcal PS was mixed with an immune\nserum pool with a high opsonic index against both serotypes 3\nFIG. 1.

The\nopsonic index of the serum pool to serotype 3 could be com-\npletely neutralized with 5 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS of serotype 3\n(left panel). Thus, the pleural \ufb02uids of patients with pleural\neffusions have suf\ufb01cient capsular PS to neutralize type-speci\ufb01c\nanticapsular antibodies in vitro.\nDISCUSSION\nPrevious studies have shown that pneumococcal pneumonia\nwith pleural effusion is associated with a limited number of\nserotypes. Table 3 summarizes 9 published studies of pneumo-\ncoccal pneumonia with pleural effusion and lists the \ufb01ve most\ncommon pneumococcal serotypes isolated in culture. It is pos-\nsible that these serotype prevalence studies based on typing of\nculture isolates may be biased toward serotypes that express\nantibiotic resistance and thus are more likely to be recovered in\nculture. This is because many patients with suspected commu-\nnity-acquired pneumonia are treated as outpatients with oral\nantibiotics. Amoxicillin alone or in combination with azithro-\nmycin is commonly used to manage pediatric patients without\nsevere pneumonia and without underlying disease. Of those\npatients who fail oral outpatient therapy and go on to develop\npleural effusion and require hospitalization, only a small per-\ncentage, typically 10 to 20% in most studies, yield culture\nisolates. There are reported differences in antibiotic resistance\namong serotypes.\nWith our combination of multiplex immunoassay and 19A\nPCR performed directly on pleural \ufb02uid, we were able to\ndetermine the serotype in 40 of 49 (82%) cases of pneumo-\ncoccal pneumonia with pleural effusion. The 4 most common\nserotypes in our study, accounting for 75% of typeable cases,\nwere serotypes 1, 3, 7F, and 19A. We cannot draw conclusions\non how the 9 nontypeable pleural \ufb02uids might have impacted\nthe serotype distribution in our study. Notwithstanding, these\nsame 4 serotypes were also found to be common in another\nrecent study of pneumococcal pneumonia (Table 3) (6), but\nnot all were commonly represented in studies where samples\nwere collected before 2001 (Table 3). These observations sug-\ngest that serotype prevalence data based on testing of culture\nisolates may not be biased toward isolates that express antibi-\notic resistance.\nFurthermore, all 5 of the culture-positive isolates in our\nstudy were very susceptible to the beta-lactam agents tested,\nincluding penicillin, amoxicillin, and ceftriaxone, with MICs in\nthe 0.01- to 0.04-\u0002g/ml range. Four of \ufb01ve isolates were also\nsusceptible to erythromycin, with MICs of 0.12 \u0002g/ml. Clearly,\nother factors such as dose and length of oral antibiotic therapy,\nhost immune response, and virulence of the serotype are im-\nportant in determining which patients develop effusion and\nwhich have positive cultures.\nThe multiplexed immunoassay for typing of pneumococcal\nPS in pleural \ufb02uids required heat pretreatment to remove\ninterfering substances; however, during this processing, we dis-\ncovered that 19A PS is quite heat labile whereas other PS\ntypes, including 19F, are heat stable. This selective heat lability\nis interesting since 19A and 19F PSs are structurally very sim-\nilar and a previous study noted that both 19A and 19F PSs were\nheat labile (25). Of note is that 6A and 6B PSs are very similar\nin structure but differ in hydrolytic stability (4, 30). It is possible\nthat only the epitope recognized with the 19A-speci\ufb01c mono-\nclonal antibody used in our assay is heat labile and that the\nheat lability may not be observed with a different 19A-speci\ufb01c\nmonoclonal antibody. Additional studies are being performed\nto investigate these possibilities. Heat pretreatment is widely\nused to reduce interfering substances in serum or urine sam-\nples before subjecting them to immunoassay (9, 19, 22, 23), and\none should be aware that heating may reduce the apparent\nconcentration of certain pneumococcal capsule types.\nWe also found that the level of capsular PS in pleural \ufb02uid\nis generally greater than 1 \u0002g/ml, which is suf\ufb01cient to neutral-\nize the opsonic capacity of anticapsular antibodies in vitro. It is\npossible that free pneumococcal capsular PS in pleural effu-\nsions in vivo can neutralize type-speci\ufb01c anticapsular antibod-\nies and thus promote the replication of pneumococci. Neutral-\nization of opsonic capacity by free capsular PS may be an\nimportant mechanism of pathogenesis of pleural effusion and\nprogression to empyema. This mechanism may also apply to\ninfections involving limited tissue spaces such as otitis media,\nand it should be interesting to determine the concentration of\ncapsular PS found in ear \ufb02uids from patients with otitis media.\nPleural effusion is a complication of pneumococcal pneumo-\nnia, and serotype prevalence among cases of pleural effusions\nFIG. 2.

The serum\npool had high opsonic activity with respect to both serotypes 3 and 8.\nPleural \ufb02uid containing serotype 3 PS and puri\ufb01ed type 3 PS (5 \u0002g/ml)\nwas used in all experiments.\nTABLE 2.

CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\nmay re\ufb02ect serotype prevalence in all cases of pneumococcal\npneumonia. We believe that serotypes 7F and 19A may be such\nserotypes. These two serotypes have become more common\namong cases of IPD following the use of PCV7 as a part of a\ngeneral shift of serotypes (1, 14, 16). Also, these serotypes have\nbecome noticeable among studies of pneumococcal pneumo-\nnia with empyema performed in the post-PCV7 era but not\namong studies performed before introduction of PCV7 (Table\n3). Interestingly, serotype 14 was very common, accounting for\n12 to 29% of cases in 6 separate studies before introduction of\nPCV7 (Table 3), but it has not been observed in three studies\nperformed after introduction of PCV7 (6). Similarly, none of\nthe pleural \ufb02uid samples collected in the 2007-2009 time pe-\nriod of our study were serotype 14. These data suggest that\nPCV7 has been effective in preventing pneumonia with pleural\neffusions due to serotype 14 pneumococci.\nPCV7 does not contain serotypes 1 and 3, and it would not\nhave affected their prevalence; however, the incidence of pneu-\nmonia with pleural effusions associated with serotypes 1 and 3\nhas been disproportionately high compared to their pneumo-\nnia incidence in many studies (Table 3) (11, 24). Serotype 3 has\nbeen known to produce high levels of capsule, and the level of\ncapsular PS may be important in pathogenesis of pneumonia\nwith pleural effusions, as discussed above. Perhaps serotype 3\npneumococci are prone to causing pleural effusions because\nthey can produce high and protective concentrations of capsu-\nlar PS, overcome host immunity, and proliferate better than\nother pneumococcal serotypes. Interestingly, the prevalence of\nserotype 3 is disproportionately higher in otitis media than in\nIPD in many different geographic regions (20). Perhaps the\npleural cavity and the middle ear are body cavities conducive\nfor the high-capsule-producing serotypes.\nSerotype 1 pneumococcus has been an uncommon (only 1 to\n2%) cause of IPD since the 1960s (11). Yet, it is the primary\nserotype associated with empyema, accounting for 21 to 67%\nfor 9 studies done in several countries from 1993 until 2007\n(Table 3). One may be able to understand this remarkable\nclinical observation with recent discoveries of immunological\nproperties of zwitterionic PS (2, 8). Zwitterionic PS has both\npositive and negative charges in its repeating unit, whereas\nmost bacterial capsular PSs have only either neutral or nega-\ntive charges. Serotype 1 PS is zwitterionic, since its repeating\nunit has one positively charged amino group and two nega-\ntively charged groups, and it has been shown to stimulate T\ncells (28) and induce intra-abdominal abscess in animal models\n(27). Induction of abdominal abscess was not unique to sero-\ntype 1 PS because zwitterionic PSs from other bacteria can\ninduce abscess formation (27). These biological properties\nwould permit serotype 1 pneumococci to form abscesses and to\nenhance development of empyema. In fact, serotype 1 has\nbeen clinically associated with complicated clinical presenta-\ntions among empyema cases (26).\nWhile PCV7 appears to have been effective in reducing\nempyema by serotype 14, our study con\ufb01rms that PCV7 would\nbe inadequate against current cases of pneumococcal empy-\nema since the vaccine does not cover the serotypes responsible\nfor the majority of cases. Since the recently approved PCV13\nincludes the four main detected serotypes causing pleural ef-\nfusions, 1, 3, 7F, and 19A, it may be useful in reducing the\nincidence of pneumococcal empyema. Future studies should\nbe done to monitor the effect of the new vaccine on empyema\namong children.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe work was supported by Public Health Service grant AI-31473\nfrom the National Institutes of Health to M.H.N.\nThe University of Alabama at Birmingham owns the intellectual\nproperty rights to the monoclonal antibodies described in this work.\nM.H.N. and J.Y. are employees of the University of Alabama.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Nahm1*\nDepartment of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama1; Department of Laboratory Medicine,\nNationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, Columbus, Ohio2; and Departments of Pediatrics and Pathology, Ohio State University,\nCollege of Medicine and Public Health, Columbus, Ohio3\nReceived 8 September 2010/Returned for modi\ufb01cation 7 November 2010/Accepted 19 November 2010\nTo determine the prevalence of serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae responsible for pneumonia with pleural\neffusion, we determined the capsular polysaccharide (PS) type directly on 49 pleural \ufb02uid specimens collected\nfrom pediatric patients during 2007 to 2009 with laboratory-con\ufb01rmed pneumococcal pneumonia by using\nmonoclonal antibodies and a multiplex, bead array immunoassay. Because the \ufb02uids had to be heated to\nremove nonspeci\ufb01c reactivity before being tested in the immunoassay and type 19A PS is heat labile, the pleural\n\ufb02uid samples were also tested for serotype 19A capsule gene locus by PCR. Use of the multiplex immunoassay\ncombined with type-speci\ufb01c 19A PCR allowed for serotype determination on 40 of 49 pleural \ufb02uids. Pneumo-\ncoccal pneumonia with pleural effusion was associated with a limited number of serotypes, with types 1, 3, 7F/A,\nand 19A accounting for 75% of the typeable cases. The concentration of capsular PS in the pleural \ufb02uids was\noften greater than 1 \u0001g/ml and suf\ufb01cient to inhibit the opsonic capacity of sera from individuals who had\nreceived the 23-valent pneumococcal PS vaccine. Based on the serotypes observed before and after introduction\nof the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, the recently licensed 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate\nvaccine may reduce the incidence of pneumonia with pleural effusions.\nParapneumonic pleural effusions in children are most com-\nmonly associated with pneumococcal infections, and they may\nlead to the more serious complication of empyema (10). With\nthe introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vac-\ncine (PCV7) in 2000, there has been a dramatic decrease in the\nnumber of cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the\nUnited States; however, the incidence of empyema has actually\nincreased by as much as 50% (6). To investigate the apparent\nfailure of PCV7 in reducing the incidence of pneumonia with\nempyema, it is important to investigate pneumococcal sero-\ntypes associated with parapneumonic pleural effusions ob-\ntained after PCV7 became widely used.\nWhile pneumococcal serotypes associated with pleural effu-\nsions have been studied in the past (6), most studies used\npneumococcal isolates obtained from blood or pleural \ufb02uid\ncultures of patients; however, this approach is insensitive and\nmay preferentially recover antibiotic-resistant serotypes be-\ncause most patients are treated with antibiotics and only a\nsmall percentage of cases yield positive cultures. To avoid\nthese limitations, two reports investigated pleural \ufb02uids di-\nrectly for the presence of pneumococcal capsular polysaccha-\nride (PS) with monoclonal antibodies (10, 12); however, these\nstudies were performed in England before PCV7 was widely\nused and they tested the \ufb02uids for only 13 capsular PS sero-\ntypes.\nRecently, we developed a multiplex immunoassay to detect\ncapsular PS of 36 pneumococcal serotypes on cultured isolates\n(29). The method was modi\ufb01ed to detect and quantify the\nconcentration of capsular PS directly in clinical samples such as\npleural \ufb02uids. We used this modi\ufb01ed method to identify pneu-\nmococcal serotypes in pleural \ufb02uids recently collected from a\npediatric population in central Ohio, a geographic region\nwhere PCV7 is widely used to immunize children.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPleural \ufb02uid specimens. Pleural \ufb02uid specimens examined in this study were\nobtained from children admitted to Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, Columbus,\nOH, from 2007 to 2009 with suspected bacterial pneumonia and from whom\npleural \ufb02uid was obtained as per standard of care by thoracentesis with or\nwithout chest tube placement. A laboratory diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumo-\nnia was made based on a positive blood or pleural \ufb02uid culture or a positive PCR\non pleural \ufb02uid for both the pneumococcal autolysin and pneumolysin genes\n(17a). Residual pleural \ufb02uid samples were stored at \u000170\u00b0C. A total of 49 positive\nsamples from 49 children aged 0.4 to 15 years (median, 4 years) were removed\nfrom storage, coded so as to remove patient identi\ufb01ers, and sent to the University\nof Alabama at Birmingham for serotype analysis. This study was approved by the\nNationwide Children\u2019s Hospital 1nstitutional Review Board.\nMultiplex immunoassay for capsular polysaccharide. Pleural \ufb02uid samples\nwere brought to 0.05 M EDTA, and the mixtures were boiled for 10 min (19, 22),\ndiluted 1:10 and 1:30, and subjected to a latex bead-based, multiplexed immu-\nnoassay for pneumococcal PS types by using a modi\ufb01cation of a previously\ndescribed procedure for typing of culture isolates (29). Brie\ufb02y, latex bead sets\ntreated with various red dyes recognizable by their differential \ufb02uorescence\nsignals were coated with type-speci\ufb01c pneumococcal capsular PS and mixed with\nPS-speci\ufb01c monoclonal antibodies and pleural \ufb02uid samples. Free PS in the\npleural \ufb02uid sample binds to free PS-speci\ufb01c monoclonal antibody and thus\ncompetitively inhibits speci\ufb01c binding of the free monoclonal antibody to the\nlatex beads coated with the speci\ufb01c PS. The presence of type-speci\ufb01c PS in the\npleural \ufb02uid was determined by \ufb02ow cytometry by watching for a reduction in\n\ufb02uorescence signal after washing of the beads and addition of phycoerythrin-\nconjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody. The assay has been designed\nto identify pneumococcal capsular PS of 36 serotypes, including all those in the\n23-valent pneumococcal PS vaccine.\nTo determine capsular PS concentrations in 15 pleural \ufb02uid samples, eight\n3-fold serial dilutions of the 15 samples and puri\ufb01ed PS controls containing 1\n\u0002g/ml of puri\ufb01ed capsular PS were prepared. The PS controls were purchased\nfrom ATCC (Manassas, VA) and included serotypes 1, 3, 6B, 7F, 8, 19A, and\n* Corresponding author.

The diluted samples and controls were then subjected to the multiplexed\nimmunoassay, and the capsular PS concentrations in the pleural \ufb02uids were\ndetermined by comparing the \ufb02uorescence signals of the samples at different\ndilutions to that of the standard curves constructed with the PS controls.\nMultiplex opsonophagocytosis assay. To obtain an antibiotic-free pleural\n\ufb02uid, 100 \u0002l of a pleural \ufb02uid sample containing serotype 3 PS (\u000320 \u0002g/ml) was\nloaded into a 250-\u0002l G-25-80 column. The column was eluted with normal saline,\nand the eluate was collected in 35-\u0002l fractions. The fractions were tested for\nantibiotic activity and the presence of serotype 3 PS. Fractions that were free of\nantibiotics, but with type 3 PS levels equivalent to the level in the original pleural\n\ufb02uid, were pooled and used in opsonophagocytosis assays.\nThe antibiotic-free, serotype 3-containing pleural \ufb02uid and a serotype 3 puri-\n\ufb01ed PS solution (10 \u0002g/ml) were then separately mixed with an equal volume of\na post-pneumococcal vaccination serum pool. The serum pool was prepared by\nmixing serum from 2 adults previously immunized with a 23-valent PS vaccine.\nThe serum pool and pleural \ufb02uid alone, as well as serum pool/type 3 pleural \ufb02uid\nor serum pool/type 3 puri\ufb01ed PS mixtures, were analyzed for their capacity to\nopsonize pneumococci in a multiplexed opsonophagocytosis assay using the\nHL60 human cell line as phagocytic cells, baby rabbit serum as a source of\ncomplement, and OREP3 and STREP8 as target pneumococcal strains (5, 21).\nOREP3 is an optochin-resistant pneumococcal strain expressing serotype 3 PS,\nand STREP8 is a streptomycin-resistant strain expressing serotype 8 PS. The\nopsonic index was de\ufb01ned as the serum dilution that killed 50% of target\nbacteria.\nPCR for pneumococcal serotype 19A. To identify the 19A-speci\ufb01c capsular\ngene, bacterial lysates or pleural \ufb02uid samples were diluted 10-fold in water and\nsubjected to 2 PCRs\u2014one targeting the pneumococcal wzy gene, the other\ntargeting the cpsA gene\u2014under previously described assay conditions (18). The\nprimers targeting the pneumococcal wzy gene were speci\ufb01c for the 19A serotype,\nand the primers targeting the cpsA gene were speci\ufb01c for all pneumococcal\ncapsular PS genes and used as a positive control. The reaction products were\nseparated by agarose electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and visu-\nalized under UV light.\nRESULTS\nDetermination of pneumococcal serotypes in pleural \ufb02uids.\nWhen the 49 pleural samples were directly analyzed for cap-\nsular PS with a multiplexed immunoassay, serotypes could be\nidenti\ufb01ed for 36 samples (Table 1). The most common sero-\ntype was serotype 3, accounting for 13 samples, and the next\nmost common serotypes were 1, 7F, and 19A, accounting for\nsix, seven, and seven samples, respectively. Pneumococci were\nisolated from pleural \ufb02uids of 5 patients, and the serotypes of\nthe isolates matched the serotypes identi\ufb01ed by testing the\npleural \ufb02uids directly (Table 1). The immunoassay could not\nidentify the serotypes of 13 pleural \ufb02uid samples. Since our\nimmunoassay tests for 36 serotypes, the 13 samples may ex-\npress one of the remaining 57 serotypes that were not included\nin our multiplex immunoassay. Alternatively, they may contain\nPS below the limits of detection of our immunoassay.\nWhile investigating the limits of detection of the immuno-\nassay, we found that, unlike other pneumococcal PS types\ntested, type 19A PS is heat labile. A 10-min boiling reduced the\nimmunoreactive concentration of puri\ufb01ed 19A PS to less than\n0.1% of the original concentration (Fig. 1). Following this\ndiscovery, the pleural \ufb02uid samples were reexamined for the\npresence of capsule gene locus of 19A serotype by PCR (18).\nThe PCR test con\ufb01rmed that all 7 samples previously identi\ufb01ed\nto be 19A and 4 previously nontypeable samples had DNA for\n19A capsule gene locus (data not shown).\nQuanti\ufb01cation of pneumococcal capsular PS in the pleural\n\ufb02uids. To determine the PS concentrations in pleural \ufb02uids, we\nselected 15 samples and reanalyzed them without boiling using\nstandard curves constituted with puri\ufb01ed pneumococcal PS.\nTwo samples had only about 0.1 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS; how-\never, 7 samples had capsular PS concentrations between 1 and\n10 \u0002g/ml, 6 samples had \u000410 \u0002g/ml, and one serotype 3 sample\nhad 800 \u0002g/ml of PS (Table 2).\nEffect of capsular PS in pleural \ufb02uids on opsonophagocyto-\nsis. About 0.1 to 1 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS was shown to inhibit\nthe opsonophagocytic capacity of postimmune sera from many\nvaccine recipients (15; unpublished data). Since most pleural\n\ufb02uids had more than 1 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS (Table 2), we\nhypothesized that pleural \ufb02uids could inhibit the opsonic ca-\npacity of immune sera. To directly test this possibility, we\nselected a serotype 3 pleural \ufb02uid sample containing 20 \u0002g/ml\nPS and of suf\ufb01cient volume to allow for additional testing.\nBecause this sample, similarly to other pleural \ufb02uids, contained\nantibiotics and was bactericidal (data not shown), it was sub-\njected to column chromatography as described above to re-\nmove the antibiotics. When the antibiotic-free pleural \ufb02uid\ncontaining type 3 pneumococcal PS was mixed with an immune\nserum pool with a high opsonic index against both serotypes 3\nFIG. 1.

The\nopsonic index of the serum pool to serotype 3 could be com-\npletely neutralized with 5 \u0002g/ml of capsular PS of serotype 3\n(left panel). Thus, the pleural \ufb02uids of patients with pleural\neffusions have suf\ufb01cient capsular PS to neutralize type-speci\ufb01c\nanticapsular antibodies in vitro.\nDISCUSSION\nPrevious studies have shown that pneumococcal pneumonia\nwith pleural effusion is associated with a limited number of\nserotypes. Table 3 summarizes 9 published studies of pneumo-\ncoccal pneumonia with pleural effusion and lists the \ufb01ve most\ncommon pneumococcal serotypes isolated in culture. 1t is pos-\nsible that these serotype prevalence studies based on typing of\nculture isolates may be biased toward serotypes that express\nantibiotic resistance and thus are more likely to be recovered in\nculture. This is because many patients with suspected commu-\nnity-acquired pneumonia are treated as outpatients with oral\nantibiotics. Amoxicillin alone or in combination with azithro-\nmycin is commonly used to manage pediatric patients without\nsevere pneumonia and without underlying disease. Of those\npatients who fail oral outpatient therapy and go on to develop\npleural effusion and require hospitalization, only a small per-\ncentage, typically 10 to 20% in most studies, yield culture\nisolates. There are reported differences in antibiotic resistance\namong serotypes.\nWith our combination of multiplex immunoassay and 19A\nPCR performed directly on pleural \ufb02uid, we were able to\ndetermine the serotype in 40 of 49 (82%) cases of pneumo-\ncoccal pneumonia with pleural effusion. The 4 most common\nserotypes in our study, accounting for 75% of typeable cases,\nwere serotypes 1, 3, 7F, and 19A. We camot draw conclusions\non how the 9 nontypeable pleural \ufb02uids might have impacted\nthe serotype distribution in our study. Notwithstanding, these\nsame 4 serotypes were also found to be common in another\nrecent study of pneumococcal pneumonia (Table 3) (6), but\nnot all were commonly represented in studies where samples\nwere collected before 2001 (Table 3). These observations sug-\ngest that serotype prevalence data based on testing of culture\nisolates may not be biased toward isolates that express antibi-\notic resistance.\nFurthermore, all 5 of the culture-positive isolates in our\nstudy were very susceptible to the beta-lactam agents tested,\nincluding penicillin, amoxicillin, and ceftriaxone, with MICs in\nthe 0.01- to 0.04-\u0002g/ml range. Four of \ufb01ve isolates were also\nsusceptible to erythromycin, with MICs of 0.12 \u0002g/ml. Clearly,\nother factors such as dose and length of oral antibiotic therapy,\nhost immune response, and virulence of the serotype are im-\nportant in determining which patients develop effusion and\nwhich have positive cultures.\nThe multiplexed immunoassay for typing of pneumococcal\nPS in pleural \ufb02uids required heat pretreatment to remove\ninterfering substances; however, during this processing, we dis-\ncovered that 19A PS is quite heat labile whereas other PS\ntypes, including 19F, are heat stable. This selective heat lability\nis interesting since 19A and 19F PSs are structurally very sim-\nilar and a previous study noted that both 19A and 19F PSs were\nheat labile (25). Of note is that 6A and 6B PSs are very similar\nin structure but differ in hydrolytic stability (4, 30). 1t is possible\nthat only the epitope recognized with the 19A-speci\ufb01c mono-\nclonal antibody used in our assay is heat labile and that the\nheat lability may not be observed with a different 19A-speci\ufb01c\nmonoclonal antibody. Additional studies are being performed\nto investigate these possibilities. Heat pretreatment is widely\nused to reduce interfering substances in serum or urine sam-\nples before subjecting them to immunoassay (9, 19, 22, 23), and\none should be aware that heating may reduce the apparent\nconcentration of certain pneumococcal capsule types.\nWe also found that the level of capsular PS in pleural \ufb02uid\nis generally greater than 1 \u0002g/ml, which is suf\ufb01cient to neutral-\nize the opsonic capacity of anticapsular antibodies in vitro. 1t is\npossible that free pneumococcal capsular PS in pleural effu-\nsions in vivo can neutralize type-speci\ufb01c anticapsular antibod-\nies and thus promote the replication of pneumococci. Neutral-\nization of opsonic capacity by free capsular PS may be an\nimportant mechanism of pathogenesis of pleural effusion and\nprogression to empyema. This mechanism may also apply to\ninfections involving limited tissue spaces such as otitis media,\nand it should be interesting to determine the concentration of\ncapsular PS found in ear \ufb02uids from patients with otitis media.\nPleural effusion is a complication of pneumococcal pneumo-\nnia, and serotype prevalence among cases of pleural effusions\nFIG. 2.

These two serotypes have become more common\namong cases of 1PD following the use of PCV7 as a part of a\ngeneral shift of serotypes (1, 14, 16). Also, these serotypes have\nbecome noticeable among studies of pneumococcal pneumo-\nnia with empyema performed in the post-PCV7 era but not\namong studies performed before introduction of PCV7 (Table\n3). 1nterestingly, serotype 14 was very common, accounting for\n12 to 29% of cases in 6 separate studies before introduction of\nPCV7 (Table 3), but it has not been observed in three studies\nperformed after introduction of PCV7 (6). Similarly, none of\nthe pleural \ufb02uid samples collected in the 2007-2009 time pe-\nriod of our study were serotype 14. These data suggest that\nPCV7 has been effective in preventing pneumonia with pleural\neffusions due to serotype 14 pneumococci.\nPCV7 does not contain serotypes 1 and 3, and it would not\nhave affected their prevalence; however, the incidence of pneu-\nmonia with pleural effusions associated with serotypes 1 and 3\nhas been disproportionately high compared to their pneumo-\nnia incidence in many studies (Table 3) (11, 24). Serotype 3 has\nbeen known to produce high levels of capsule, and the level of\ncapsular PS may be important in pathogenesis of pneumonia\nwith pleural effusions, as discussed above. Perhaps serotype 3\npneumococci are prone to causing pleural effusions because\nthey can produce high and protective concentrations of capsu-\nlar PS, overcome host immunity, and proliferate better than\nother pneumococcal serotypes. 1nterestingly, the prevalence of\nserotype 3 is disproportionately higher in otitis media than in 1PD in many different geographic regions (20). Perhaps the\npleural cavity and the middle ear are body cavities conducive\nfor the high-capsule-producing serotypes.\nSerotype 1 pneumococcus has been an uncommon (only 1 to\n2%) cause of 1PD since the 1960s (11). Yet, it is the primary\nserotype associated with empyema, accounting for 21 to 67%\nfor 9 studies done in several countries from 1993 until 2007\n(Table 3). One may be able to understand this remarkable\nclinical observation with recent discoveries of immunological\nproperties of zwitterionic PS (2, 8). Zwitterionic PS has both\npositive and negative charges in its repeating unit, whereas\nmost bacterial capsular PSs have only either neutral or nega-\ntive charges. Serotype 1 PS is zwitterionic, since its repeating\nunit has one positively charged amino group and two nega-\ntively charged groups, and it has been shown to stimulate T\ncells (28) and induce intra-abdominal abscess in animal models\n(27). 1nduction of abdominal abscess was not unique to sero-\ntype 1 PS because zwitterionic PSs from other bacteria can\ninduce abscess formation (27). These biological properties\nwould permit serotype 1 pneumococci to form abscesses and to\nenhance development of empyema. 1n fact, serotype 1 has\nbeen clinically associated with complicated clinical presenta-\ntions among empyema cases (26).\nWhile PCV7 appears to have been effective in reducing\nempyema by serotype 14, our study con\ufb01rms that PCV7 would\nbe inadequate against current cases of pneumococcal empy-\nema since the vaccine does not cover the serotypes responsible\nfor the majority of cases. Since the recently approved PCV13\nincludes the four main detected serotypes causing pleural ef-\nfusions, 1, 3, 7F, and 19A, it may be useful in reducing the\nincidence of pneumococcal empyema. Future studies should\nbe done to monitor the effect of the new vaccine on empyema\namong children.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe work was supported by Public Health Service grant AI-31473\nfrom the National 1nstitutes of Health to M.H.N.\nThe University of Alabama at Birmingham owns the intellectual\nproperty rights to the monoclonal antibodies described in this work.\nM.H.N. and J.Y. are employees of the University of Alabama.\nREFERENCES\n1.

This\nreceptor consists of four short consensus regions (SCR1 to SCR4) which normally function in complement\nregulation. Measles virus has recently been shown to interact with SCR1 and SCR2. 1n this study, receptors\non different types of monkey erythrocytes were employed as \u201cnatural mutant proteins\u201d to further de\ufb01ne the\nvirus binding regions of CD46. Erythrocytes from African green monkeys and rhesus macaques hemagglutinate\nin the presence of measles virus, while baboon erythrocytes were the least ef\ufb01cient of the Old World monkey\ncells used in these assays. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the SCR2 domain of baboon CD46 contained\nan Arg-to-Gln mutation at amino acid position 103 which accounted for reduced hemagglutination activity.\nSurprisingly, none of the New World monkey erythrocytes hemagglutinated in the presence of virus. Sequenc-\ning of cDNAs derived from the lymphocytes of these New World monkeys and analysis of their erythrocytes with\nSCR1-speci\ufb01c polyclonal antibodies indicated that the SCR1 domain was deleted in these cells. Additional\nexperiments, which used 35 different site-speci\ufb01c mutations inserted into CD46, were performed to complement\nthe preceding studies. The effects of these arti\ufb01cial mutations were documented with a convenient binding\nassay using insect cells expressing the measles virus hemagglutinin. Mutations which mimicked the change\nfound in baboon CD46 or another which deleted the SCR2 glycosylation site reduced binding substantially.\nAnother mutation which altered GluArg to AlaAla at positions 58 and 59, totally abolished binding. Finally, the\nepitopes for two monoclonal antibodies which inhibit measles virus attachment were mapped to the same\nregions implicated by mutagenesis.\nCD46, also known as membrane cofactor protein, was re-\ncently shown to be a primate-speci\ufb01c receptor for the labora-\ntory-adapted Edmonston strain of measles virus (15, 16, 22,\n50). This surface glycoprotein is expressed on most types of\ncells and normally functions as a regulator of complement\nactivity and helps to protect self tissue from autoimmune de-\nstruction (40, 41). CD46 is composed of four extracellular\nshort consensus domains (SCR1, SCR2, SCR3, and SCR4)\nfollowed by a region rich in serine, threonine, and proline\n(called STP), a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic\ndomain at its carboxyl terminus. Variations in splicing of exons\nencoding STP cassettes and cytoplasmic regions yield glyco-\nproteins which vary in size from 57 to 67 kDa and consist of all\nfour SCR domains, a combination of STP regions, and one of\ntwo different possible carboxy termini (62, 63, 71). Each of the\nknown splicing variants of human CD46 is capable of binding\nmeasles virus (21, 46).\nThe CD46 binding domains for the laboratory-adapted Ed-\nmonston strain of measles virus have recently been mapped to\nSCR1 and SCR2 (47) by using chimeric recombinant mole-\ncules composed of parts of CD46 and a related molecule called\nCD55, or decay-accelerating factor. Another group has done\nsimilar experiments with chimeras of CD46 and CD4 (11),\nwhile others expressed CD46 deletion mutants in Chinese\nhamster ovary cells (30) and con\ufb01rmed the role of SCR1 and\nSCR2 in virus binding. Monoclonal antibodies speci\ufb01c for\nSCR1 and SCR2 also block measles virus binding to the host\ncell (30, 47). The role of carbohydrate linked to the asparagine\nresidue in the SCR1 domain of CD46 appears to be minimal,\nwhile carbohydrate associated with asparagine in SCR2 ap-\npears to be critical for binding measles virus (42, 43).\nMeasles virus (25, 78) is a paramyxovirus which consists of a\nnegative-strand RNA genome and an envelope which contains\ntwo surface glycoproteins known as hemagglutinin protein (H)\nand membrane fusion protein (F). A nonglycosylated mem-\nbrane protein (M) lies on the inner side of the envelope and\nmediates an association of the glycoproteins with the nucleo-\ncapsid of the virus. H protein is responsible for virus attach-\nment and interacts with CD46 (4, 14, 42), while F mediates\npenetration and syncytium formation (45, 65, 67, 70, 82). 1n-\nteraction of H with its receptor has been shown to downregu-\nlate surface CD46 in cultured cells (28, 35, 49, 73\u201375), and four\namino acids on the virus attachment protein have recently\nbeen implicated in this interaction (8). 1n addition, virus grown\nin cultured cells binds to the receptors on many, but not all,\nspecies of monkey erythrocytes to yield hemagglutination (20,\n53\u201355, 57\u201359, 69). Hemagglutination assays with erythrocytes\nfrom cercopithecus and rhesus monkeys have traditionally\nbeen used to determine titers of laboratory strains of measles\n* Corresponding author.

However, the\nerythrocytes of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas do not hem-\nagglutinate in the presence of measles virus, which correlates\nwith the absence of CD46 on the surfaces of erythrocytes from\nthese higher primates (19, 52).\nSince a number of species of monkey erythrocytes vary in\ntheir ability to bind measles virus and subsequently hemagglu-\ntinate (18\u201320), we proposed to use the receptors on these\nerythrocytes as \u201cnatural mutant proteins\u201d in an attempt to\nfurther de\ufb01ne the binding regions of CD46. 1n this work, we\n\ufb01rst studied the ability of New World and Old World monkey\nerythrocytes to hemagglutinate in the presence of measles vi-\nrus. Surprisingly, none of the New World monkey erythrocytes\nhemagglutinated in the presence of measles virus, although it\nwas evident that they expressed CD46 on their cell surfaces.\nThe CD46 molecules from the lymphocytes and erythrocytes of\nNew World monkeys all lacked the SCR1 coding region adja-\ncent to the amino-terminal signal peptide. A speci\ufb01c mutation\npresent within the CD46 molecules of baboons which could\naccount for diminished hemagglutination activity in the pres-\nence of measles virus was noted. 1n addition, the effects of\ncertain arti\ufb01cial mutations introduced into CD46 by site-spe-\nci\ufb01c mutagenesis are reported.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell lines and virus.

Polyclonal anti-\nbodies (CD46-333) directed against entire CD46 protein and antiserum directed\nagainst the SCR1 domain of CD46 protein were prepared by immunization of\nrabbits with puri\ufb01ed recombinant protein. The entire CD46-coding region (iso-\ntype C2) was synthesized by PCR with oligonucleotide primers as previously\ndescribed (15). The DNA fragment was cloned into the NheI site of the bacu-\nlovirus expression vector BlueBac2 (pETL), and recombinant baculovirus was\ngenerated (36, 68, 80). Recombinant CD46 protein was expressed in Sf9 insect\ncells, resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, electro-\neluted, and injected into rabbits to generate a polyclonal antibody by routine\nmethods (66, 81). A DNA fragment containing SCR1 was synthesized by PCR\nwith\noligonucleotide\nprimers\ncorresponding\nto\nthe\n59\nend\n(59-AACGGATCCT-GTGAGGAGCCACCAACA-39)\nand\nthe\n39\nend\n(59-TGGTGTTCGAAAATTGTCCGCAGTAGA-CTCTG-39) of the SCR1-\ncoding sequence. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and\nthen cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pT7-7His cut with the same\nenzymes (77). The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli\nBL21(DE3) by electroporation, and the recombinant protein was expressed by\ninduction with 0.4 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The SCR1\npolypeptide fused to His6 was puri\ufb01ed by metal chelation chromotography with\nNi-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions (61). Pu-\nri\ufb01ed SCR1 polypeptide was injected into rabbits for the production of poly-\nclonal antibodies (27). 1n addition, the monoclonal antibody E4.3 (speci\ufb01c for\nSCR1) was purchased from Bio/Can Scienti\ufb01c (Mississauga, Canada), and mono-\nclonal antibody M75 (speci\ufb01c for SCR2) came from Seikugaku 1nc. (Tokyo,\nJapan).\nHemagglutination of different primate erythrocytes by measles virus. Primate\nblood samples were collected from animals in Vacutainer tubes containing hep-\narin-EDTA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) and stored in Alsevier\u2019s\nsolution (GIBCO-BRL) for no more than 2 days. Cells were washed two times\nwith phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and a 1% (vol/vol) solution was used in\nthe hemagglutination assays. A standard sample of concentrated measles virus\n(107 PFU/ml) was diluted serially (1:1) with PBS, and 50 ml of each dilution was\nadded to individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate with round-bottom cham-\nbers (Costar, Cambridge, Mass.). A 50-ml sample of the erythrocytes was added\nto each well. Hemagglutination was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Erythro-\ncytes settled to the bottom of the chambers when the assay was negative but\nformed a suspended matrix when the assay was positive. The assay titer was the\nhighest dilution of virus which produced hemagglutination. 1solation of monkey lymphocytes and synthesis of cDNAs from CD46 mRNA.\nLymphocytes from different monkey species were prepared by using a Ficoll-\nPaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) discontinuous gradient. Fresh monkey\nblood (2 to 3 ml) was diluted with an equal volume of balanced salt solution\n(0.01% anhydrous D-glucose, 5 mM CaCl2, 98 mM MgCl2, 0.545 mM KCl, 0.126\nM NaCl, and 14.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and layered onto 3 ml of Ficoll-Paque.\nThe sample was centrifuged at 700 3 g for 30 min at 20\u00b0C. The lymphocyte layer\nat the balanced salt solution\u2013Ficoll-Paque interface was collected and diluted\nwith 3 volumes of balanced salt solution. Following centrifugation at 700 3 g for\n10 min at 20\u00b0C, the lymphocyte pellet was washed once with 1 ml of balanced salt\nsolution and then resuspended in 1 ml of TRIzol (GIBCO-BRL). Chloroform\n(0.2 ml) was added, and the TRIzol lysate was vortexed and left for 3 min at room\ntemperature. The denatured extract was centrifuged at 10,000 3 g for 10 min at\n4\u00b0C. RNA in the upper aqueous layer was then precipitated with 0.5 ml of\nisopropanol at room temperature for 10 min and then concentrated by centrif-\nugation at 10,000 3 g for 10 min. Finally, the pellet was washed once with 75%\nethanol, dried in the air, and resuspended in 50 ml of H2O. Synthesis of cDNA\nwas performed from mRNA by using the First Strand Synthesis kit (Pharmacia)\nand a speci\ufb01c CD46 primer (59-GGGACAACACAAATTACTGC-39). Double-\nstranded DNA fragments were generated by nested PCRs. Primers derived from\nthe\nhuman\nCD46\nsequence\ncorresponding\nto\n59-GCAACTCCAACAACTATGGC-39\nand\n59-AGTGTCCCTTTCCTTCCTG-39 were used for the \ufb01rst 30 rounds of PCR\nampli\ufb01cation. 1nterior,\nor\nnested,\nprimers\ncorresponding\nto\n59-ACAATCACAGCAATGACCCA-39\nand\n59-CGCTTTCCTGGGTTGCTTC-39 of human CD46 were used for the follow-\ning 30 rounds of PCR.\nDetermination of the 5*-terminal sequences of CD46 mRNA. The 59-terminal\ncoding regions of different monkey CD46 molecules were determined by using\nthe Marathon cDNA Ampli\ufb01cation Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) as described\nin the reference manual. Poly(A)1 RNA was \ufb01rst isolated from total RNA by\nusing a QuickPrep mRNA puri\ufb01cation kit (Pharmacia). Reverse transcriptase\n(RT) and an oligo(dT) primer were used to synthesize the \ufb01rst-strand cDNA\nfrom 1 mg of poly(A)1 RNA. The second-strand DNA was synthesized by using\na mixture of RNase H, DNA polymerase 1, DNA ligase, and then T4 DNA\npolymerase (26). The Marathon cDNA adapter was ligated to the double-\nstranded DNA after synthesis of second-strand cDNA. Monkey CD46 fragment\ncontaining the 59 coding region was generated by nested PCR with a human\nCD46-speci\ufb01c primer (59-TAAGACACTTTGGAACTGGG-39) and the Mara-\nthon\ncDNA\nadapter-speci\ufb01c\nprimer\nAP1\n(59-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-39) for the \ufb01rst 30 rounds of\nPCR and with a human CD46-speci\ufb01c nested primer (59--39) and the Marathon\ncDNA\nadapter-speci\ufb01c\nnested\nprimer\nAP2\n(59-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-39) for the next 30 rounds of PCR\nampli\ufb01cation. CD46 DNA fragments from the different monkeys were rendered\nblunt with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, Calif.) and then cloned into\nthe SrfI site of the PCR Script Amp (SK1) vector (Stratagene).\nSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. SDS-poly-\nacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblot analysis were per-\nformed as previously described (81). The E4.3 and M75 monoclonal antibodies\n(1:500 dilution) were incubated with nitrocellulose paper blotted with total\nproteins from OST-7 cells infected with mutant CD46 recombinant virus. Bind-\ning of monoclonal antibodies was detected by ECL chemiluminescence (Amer-\nsham, Arlington Heights, 1ll.).\nDNA sequencing. DNA fragments contained in PCR-Script AmP (SK(1)\nvectors were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems 430I automated sequencer\nlocated at the Amgen DNA sequencing facility (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif.).\nSequence analysis and alignments were performed with Lasergene software\n(DNASTAR, Madison, Wis.).\nFlow cytometry analysis of monkey erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Monkey\nblood (50 ml) was centrifuged at 1,500 3 g for 5 min, washed twice with 5 ml of\n\ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine\nserum albumin, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% sodium azide). The erythrocytes were\nresuspended in 100 ml of the same buffer containing a 1:100 dilution of either\npreimmune antibody, CD46-333 antibody, or SCR1 antibody for 1 h on ice.\nFollowing the incubation, cells were washed twice with 3 ml of FACS buffer by\ncentrifugation at 1,500 3 g for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in 100 ml of the\nsame buffer containing a 1:100 dilution of \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-\nlabeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (heavy plus light chains) for 1 h on\nice. After being washed twice with 3 ml of FACS buffer, the blood cells were\nsuspended in 0.5 ml of FACS buffer and were subsequently analyzed on a Becton\nDickinson analyzer equipped with a 15-mW argon laser at 488 nm. The data were\ncollected and analyzed with CellQuest software.\nMonkey lymphocytes were also analyzed by \ufb02ow cytometry. The monkey blood\nsamples were prepared and labeled as described above. Following the incubation\nVOL. 71, 1997\nCD46 REGIONS 1MPORTANT FOR MEASLES VIRUS BINDING\n6145\n\nwith FITC-labeled anti-rabbit 1gG, the cells were washed and resuspended in 100\nml of FACS buffer. Erythrocytes were lysed by treatment of each sample with 1\nml of FACS lysis buffer (Becton Dickinson) for 1 min. The lymphocytes were\nwashed twice with 3 ml of FACS buffer, and monkey lymphocyte \ufb02uorescence\ndata were collected as described in the previous paragraph. Mouse OST7 cells\n(2 3 106 cells) which expressed mutant forms of CD46 were suspended in 1 ml\nof Cell Dissociation Buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and washed two times by\ncentrifugation with FACS buffer. The \ufb01nal pellet was suspended in 100 ml of\nFACS buffer prior to analysis by \ufb02uorescence cytometry.\nSite-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis of CD46 and expression of mutants by using vac-\ncinia virus recombinants. Portions of SCR1 and SCR2 domains were replaced\nwith point mutations or four to six alanine residues by using gel-puri\ufb01ed oligo-\nnucleotides consisting of 30 to 40 nucleotides. Mutations were introduced into\nthe CD46 molecule by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from\nStratagene. The CD46-coding region (isotype C2) was cloned into PCR-Script\nAmp SK(1) plasmid, denatured, and annealed with two complementary oligo-\nnucleotides containing the desired mutation; the mutagenized DNA strands were\nextended with Pfu polymerase; the methylated nonmutated parental DNA tem-\nplate was digested with DpnI; and the mutated plasmid was used to transform\nXL2-Blue ultracompetent cells. Mutant plasmids were isolated, and the CD46\ninserts were completely sequenced. The mutagenized CD46-coding regions were\nexcised from the PCR-Script plasmid following digestion with BspHI (59 end)\nand BglII (39 end) and ligated into the vaccinia virus vector pTM1 (containing the\nT7 promoter) which had been digested with the compatible restriction enzymes\nNcoI and BamHI. Vaccinia virus recombinants were prepared and titers were\ndetermined by plaque assays as previously described, using HuTK-143B cells and\nbromodeoxyuridine selection (17). CD46 mutants were expressed in mouse\nOST-7 cells which contained the T7 polymerase, and protein synthesis and\nsurface expression were monitored by Western immunoblot and FACS scan\nanalysis.\nDirect binding assays between CD46 mutants and insect cells expressing\nmeasles virus H protein. Mutant CD46-coding sequences were cloned into the\npTM1 vaccinia virus expression vector, which uses the T7 promoter to direct\ntranscription of the foreign gene. Recombinant vaccinia virus was prepared as\npreviously described (17), and mutant CD46 molecules were expressed in mouse\nOST7 cells which contain the T7 polymerase. Sf9 insect cells were infected for\n48 h with a recombinant baculovirus (81) which had been generated with the\nBlueBac2 expression vector (Invitrogen) (36, 68) and synthesized both the mea-\nsles virus H protein and b-galactosidase. The insect cells were colored blue by\nadding Bluogal (GIBCO-BRL, Grand 1sland, N.Y.), at 36 h of infection, from a\nstock solution (50 mg/ml in dimethylformamide) to give a 0.05% (wt/vol) \ufb01nal\nconcentration. 1nfections with recombinant vaccinia virus were allowed to pro-\nceed for 12 h; Sf9 insect cells expressing the measles H protein and b-galacto-\nsidase were incubated for 1/2 h with the vaccinia virus-infected mouse OST7 cells\nin the presence of PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum. Nonadsorbed insect cells\nwere eluted by washing the mouse cells two times with PBS. Binding in 25-cm2\ntissue culture \ufb02asks could be quantitated visually under a microscope or quan-\ntitatively by the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenylgalactoside (ONPG) with a b-galac-\ntosidase assay kit (Stratagene). Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of 100 mM sodium\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% Nonidet P-40.\nAliquots of lysate (50 ml) were added to a 96-well microtitration plate, and\nfreshly prepared buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4,\n50 mM b-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) was mixed with each aliquot to give a \ufb01nal\nvolume of 160 ml. A 50-ml volume of ONPG solution (4 mg/ml in 100 mM sodium\nphosphate, pH 7.5) was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C until a yellow\ncolor was evident, after about 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition\nof 90 ml of 1 M Na2CO3, and the color intensity was measured at 420 nm with a\nSpectraMax 250 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader purchased\nfrom Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, Calif.). Results were linear over time for an\nabsorbance range of 0.1 to 1 A420 unit.\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The nucleotide sequences coding for\nthe extracellular domains of monkey CD46 molecules were submitted to Gen-\nBank and have the following accession numbers: Aotus trivirgatus, U87914; Papio\nhamadryas, U87915; Callimico goeldii, U87916; Callithrix jacchus, U87917; Sagui-\nnus mystax, U87918; Saimiri sciureus, U87919; Cercopithecus aethiops, U87920;\nMacaca fascicularis, U87921; Macaca mulatta, U87922; and Pithecia pithecia,\nU87923.\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of CD46 surface expression and hemagglutination\nof primate erythrocytes in the presence of Edmonston measles\nvirus. Certain monkey erythrocytes are known to bind measles\nvirus and have been routinely used to determine titers of mea-\nsles virus in hemagglutination assays (19, 56). However, it is\nknown that human and chimpanzee erythrocytes do not hem-\nagglutinate in the presence of measles virus (19, 54). This can\nnow be attributed to the fact that the erythrocytes of humans,\ngorillas, and chimpanzees do not have CD46, the receptor for\nmeasles virus, on their cell surfaces (52). African green mon-\nkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) erythrocytes are known to be most\nsensitive to measles virus-induced agglutination (18, 20, 69).\nWe collected erythrocytes from a number of Old World and\nNew World monkeys and assayed their ability to hemaggluti-\nnate in the presence of Edmonston measles virus which had\nbeen propagated in Vero monkey kidney cells (Table 1). The\npresence of CD46 on the surfaces of these monkey erythro-\ncytes was \ufb01rst veri\ufb01ed by \ufb02uorescence analysis with a poly-\nclonal antibody speci\ufb01c for human CD46. All primate eryth-\nrocytes which were tested, with the exception of human and\nchimpanzee erythrocytes, bound the CD46 antibody. Levels of\nimmune recognition were probably less in Lemur macaco due\nto species-speci\ufb01c variation of its CD46 protein. Hemaggluti-\nnation assays mediated by measles virus were performed, and\nit was obvious that erythrocytes from South American marmo-\nsets and tamarins (Callimico goeldii, Callithrix jacchus, Pithecia\npithecia, Saimiri sciureus, and Leontopithecus rosalia) and\nMadagascar lemur failed to bind measles virus (Table 1). Old\nWorld monkey erythrocytes varied in their ability to hemag-\nglutinate in the presence of the virus. As expected, human and\nchimpanzee erythrocytes did not hemagglutinate, while Cerco-\npithecus aethiops, Cercopithecus diana, M. fascicularis, M. mu-\nlatta, Erythrocebus patas, and Cercocebus torquatus lunulatus\nyielded high hemagglutination titers. Cercopithecus monkeys\nconsistently yielded slightly higher hemagglutination titers\nthan the rest of the monkeys, as previously reported (18, 20).\nOn the other hand, erythrocytes from baboons (Papio anubis\nand Papio hamadryas) always produced much lower titers in\nTABLE 1.

The antibody-speci\ufb01c \ufb02uores-\ncence intensity is represented as a number. Preimmune rabbit antibody yielded\na background \ufb02uorescence of 0.200 to 0.500.\nb Hemagglutination titers were measured in microtiter plates with standard\nconcentrated measles virus from culture medium diluted serially by one-half in\nPBS buffer; an equal volume of a 1% (vol/vol) suspension of monkey erythrocytes\nwas added to each well, and the assay mixture was allowed to incubate for 2 h at\n4\u00b0C. The larger dilution indicated an increased ability of the erythrocytes to\nhemagglutinate in the presence of measles virus; less virus was required to\ncross-link erythrocytes and maintain them in suspension. Assays with Old World\nmonkey erythrocytes were performed four times and averaged.\n6146\nHSU ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nour assays. We proposed to isolate mRNA from the lympho-\ncytes of these monkeys, synthesize cDNA, and sequence the\nregions coding for the extracellular domains of CD46 in an\nattempt to explain the species-speci\ufb01c variation in hemagglu-\ntination titers exhibited by these different erythrocytes.\nSequence comparisons of CD46 extracellular domains from\ndifferent primates. Lymphocytes were isolated from the blood\nof different monkeys, and cDNAs were prepared by using\nspeci\ufb01c primers and RT, followed by PCR (RT-PCR). The\npredicted amino acid sequence was deduced from at least\nthree separate PCRs for each type of monkey. Subsequently,\nthe signal peptide and short consensus regions (SCR1 to\nSCR4) were aligned by using the Clustal program from Laser-\ngene (Fig. 1). Overall, the CD46 molecules from the different\nprimates were highly conserved, and the protein sequences of\nthe SCR3 and SCR4 regions from all the primates were ex-\ntremely similar. The SCR3 and SCR4 domains of Old World\nmacaques exhibited 93% identity to the human sequence,\nFIG. 1. Amino acid sequence alignment of signal peptides and short consensus regions from CD46 molecules found in lymphocytes of Old World and New World\nmonkeys. Blood samples were obtained from a variety of primates originating from either Africa or South America. Lymphocytes were isolated by gradient\ncentrifugation, total RNA was extracted, and cDNA was prepared with RT by using speci\ufb01c oligonucleotide primers from the conserved STP and transmembrane\ndomains. DNA sequences were ampli\ufb01ed by using conserved oligonucleotides upstream of the signal peptide region and regions adjacent to the SCR4 regions. The\n59 ends of New World monkeys were also cloned by rapid ampli\ufb01cation of cDNA ends with a conserved primer from the SCR3 region. At least three independent cDNA\nclones were sequenced, translated to yield a predicted protein, and aligned by using the Clustal method in the Lasergene DNA analysis package. Residues which differ\nfrom the human consensus are shaded. Old World primates include humans (Homo sapiens), cynomolgus monkeys (M. fascicularis), rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta),\nbaboons (Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas), and African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops). New World primates which we tested were the common marmoset\n(Callithrix jacchus), Goeldii\u2019s marmoset (Callimico goeldii), the moustached marmoset (Saguinus mystax), the white-faced saki (Pithecia pithecia), the owl monkey (A.\ntrivirgatus), and the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). The signal peptide and SCR1, SCR2, and SCR3 regions are indicated by solid lines beneath the sequences. The\nSCR4 domain is not shown, since it was very similar for all monkeys tested. The mutation found in baboon CD46 at amino acid 103 is highlighted by a solid box.\nVOL. 71, 1997\nCD46 REGIONS 1MPORTANT FOR MEASLES VIRUS BINDING\n6147\n\nwhile those of New World monkeys were 80% identical. This\nconservation seems consistent with the role of these regions of\nCD46 in complement regulation (40, 41). Since the SCR4\nsequence is very similar for all monkeys, it is not shown in Fig.\n1. The conserved amino-terminal signal peptides, STP regions,\nand membrane-spanning regions facilitated RT-PCR across\nthe extracellular domain of CD46. 1t was immediately evident\nthat the coding region for SCR1 (consisting of 63 amino acids)\nwas missing from the cDNAs derived from the mRNAs of New\nWorld monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, Pithecia pithecia, Callimico\ngoeldii, A. trivirgatus, and Saimiri sciureus). The observation\nthat the SCR1-coding region was missing from mRNAs of\nlymphocytes and erythrocyte precursors of New World mon-\nkeys explains why the erythrocytes of New World monkeys did\nnot hemagglutinate in the presence of measles virus, since this\nregion has previously been implicated in measles virus binding\n(30, 47). The SCR2 region varied most from the human se-\nquence for both Old World and New World monkeys. This\nregion was 73% identical to the human SCR2 for Old World\nmonkeys and 68% identical for New World monkeys. Con-\nserved regions of identity might be expected to participate in\nbinding to the measles virus H protein.\nThe CD46 sequences for different classes of Old and New\nWorld monkeys resembled each other and could clearly be\nused to classify the primates into different groups. Baboons,\nmacaques, and African green monkeys belong to the family\nCercopithecidae (51), and all have similar changes at 28 posi-\ntions in the signal peptide and SCR regions when compared to\nthe same extracellular portion of human CD46. Bands of\namino acid identity at over 22 positions could easily differen-\ntiate whether the CD46 sequence belonged to an Old or New\nWorld monkey. South American monkeys could be further\nsubclassi\ufb01ed on the basis of 10 additional variations in the\nsequence shown in Fig. 1. Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus and\nCallimico goeldii) and tamarins (Saguinus mystax, Saguinus oe-\ndipus, and Leontipithecus rosalia) belong to the Callithrichidae\nfamily (51). On the other hand, squirrel monkeys (Saimiri\nsciureus), owl monkeys (A. trivirgatus), and white-faced sakis\n(Pithecia pithecia) are members of the Cebidae family (51).\nThese family af\ufb01liations are re\ufb02ected in amino acid variations\nfound in the external domains of CD46 (Fig. 1).\nCD46 sequences from baboons contained only seven amino\nacid changes when compared to the cercopithecus monkey\nsequence; six of these changes (positions 71, 92, 106, 113, 149,\nand 172) were conservative, but the other change, at position\n103, produced an Arg-to-Gln substitution. This change might\naccount for the reduced hemagglutination properties of ba-\nboon erythrocytes and was considered in subsequent studies.\nCynomolgus (M. fascicularis) and rhesus (M. mulatta) monkey\nCD46 sequences were almost identical to the sequence of\nCercopithecus aethiops, and all changes were minor and con-\nservative. A slightly greater level of CD46 cell surface expres-\nsion on the erythrocytes of Cercopithecus aethiops and Cerco-\npithecus diana could explain the consistent difference in\nhemagglutination between cercopithecus monkeys and ma-\ncaques (Table 1). 1t should also be noted that the Edmonston\nstrain of measles virus has been routinely propagated in Vero\nand CV-1 cells, which are derived from the kidneys of an\nAfrican green monkey. Propagation of this laboratory strain in\nculture would ultimately favor the binding of measles virus to\nthe Cercophithecus aethiops CD46 receptor over those of other\nmonkeys.\nConserved blocks of amino acids in the SCR1 and SCR2\nregions could give some clues as to which regions are most\nimportant in binding to measles virus. SCR1 regions between\namino acids 37 to 54 and 56 to 91 seem to be almost identical\nin the Old World monkeys. 1n addition, SCR2 regions consist-\ning of residues 96 to 99, 103 to 109, 113 to 117, 124 to 135, 137\nto 144, and 146 to 162 are almost identical in CD46 molecules\nfrom the Old World monkeys and could contribute to virus\nbinding. Glycosylation sites at Asn83 and Asn114 are abso-\nlutely retained, 6 of 8 cysteine residues are conserved, and the\n13 prolines are maintained at all positions except residues 100,\n104, and 112. 1t was interesting that baboons, macaques, and\nAfrican green monkeys contained another potential glycosyla-\ntion site in their SCR3 domain at residue 213. However, this\nshould not affect binding to H, since this region of CD46 does\nnot appear to interact with the virus during attachment.\nPolyclonal antibodies con\ufb01rm that the SCR1 region is ab-\nsent from CD46 molecules expressed on the erythrocytes and\nlymphocytes from New World monkeys. SCR1 polypeptides\n(amino acids 30 to 91) derived from CD46 were expressed in E.\ncoli, and recombinant protein was puri\ufb01ed and injected into\nrabbits in order to generate polyclonal antibodies. These anti-\nbodies were used to study surface expression of SCR1 on\nerythrocytes, lymphocytes, and a number of cell lines from Old\nand New World monkeys by \ufb02uorescent-antibody analysis. A\npolyclonal antibody directed against the entire CD46 molecule\nindicated that the erythrocytes from most Old and all New\nWorld monkeys express CD46 on their cell surface (Fig. 2).\nHowever, SCR1-speci\ufb01c antibodies clearly con\ufb01rmed that the\nerythrocytes of Old World monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops,\nM. mulatta, M. fascicularis, and Papio anubis) expressed the\nSCR1 domain of CD46 on their surface (Fig. 2A), while anal-\nysis of New World monkeys (A. trivirgatus, Saimiri sciureus,\nCallithrix jacchus, and Saguinus oedipus) showed that it was\nabsent (Fig. 2B). Analysis of lymphocytes, following lysis of\nerythrocytes, gave identical results (data not shown). This re-\nsult con\ufb01rmed our RT-PCR analysis of mRNA derived from\nlymphocytes and explained why New World monkey erythro-\ncytes did not hemagglutinate in the presence of the laboratory\nstrain of Edmonston measles virus, since the SCR1 domain has\nbeen implicated in measles virus binding (30, 47).\nA convenient binding assay with Sf9 insect cells expressing\nmeasles virus H protein and b-galactosidase can be used to\nstudy the binding domains of CD46. Our laboratory previously\ndemonstrated that Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant\nbaculovirus expressing the measles virus H protein (Sf9-H)\nwere capable of binding to erythrocytes from African green\nmonkeys (80). Since recombinant baculovirus was derived by\nusing the BlueBac2 (pETL) expression vector (36, 68), the\ninsect cells expressed b-galactosidase as well as measles virus\nH protein. We reasoned that these infected Sf9 cells grown in\nsuspension should be capable of binding to mammalian cells\nwith CD46 at their cell surface. Preliminary studies demon-\nstrated that Sf9-H cells could indeed bind to HeLa cells and in\naddition could be stained blue in the presence of Bluogal, a\nsubstrate for b-galactosidase (29). Control Sf9 insect cells in-\nfected with wild-type Autographa californica nuclear polyhe-\ndrosis virus did not adhere to target cells and could be washed\naway. A mouse cell line containing the T7 polymerase gene\n(OST-7) does not normally bind measles virus. When infected\nwith a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing human CD46\nunder control of the T7 promoter, these rodent cells could bind\nthe Sf9-H cells (Fig. 3D). Mouse cells infected with wild-type\nvaccinia virus or a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the\nSCR1, STP, and transmembrane regions of CD46 could not\nbind the Sf9-H cells (Fig. 3A and B). However, mouse OST-7\ncells infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the\nSCR1, SCR2, STP, and transmembrane regions (Fig. 3C)\ncould bind Sf9-H cells just as well as if they were infected with\nvaccinia virus synthesizing the whole CD46 molecule (Fig. 3D).\n6148\nHSU ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nThese results con\ufb01rm previous \ufb01ndings (11, 30, 47) which show\nthat both the SCR1 and SCR2 domains of CD46 are required\nfor measles virus binding. The results presented in Fig. 3 attest\nto the credibility of this assay and establish a simple direct\nbinding assay for interaction between measles virus H protein\nand the human CD46 molecule. Previous investigators moni-\ntored this binding indirectly through the ability of measles virus\nto initiate infection in rodent cells expressing CD46 variants\n(47), \ufb02uorescence microscopy with measles antibodies (47),\n\ufb02uorescence cytometry measurements with H monoclonal an-\ntibody (30, 50), or the ability to form rosettes between African\ngreen monkey erythrocytes and the CD46-bearing target cell\n(15) or semiquantitatively with a biotinylated H protein overlay\nbinding assay with nitrocellulose blots containing CD46 (42).\nOur new binding assay with Sf9-H cells offers the advantages of\nbeing quick, sensitive, and easy to quantitate with either Bluo-\ngal or ONPG substrates.\nSite-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis can be used to map regions of\nCD46 important for interaction of the H protein. Binding of\nmeasles virus to African green monkey erythrocytes has pre-\nviously been reported to be reversed by incubation with 1 M\narginine, and consequently, electrostatic interactions appeared\nto be important in virus attachment (37). With this result in\nmind, we decided to initiate our mutagenesis studies by sys-\ntematically replacing charged amino acids in the SCR1 and\nSCR2 domains with alanine. Larger stretches of the CD46\nbinding domains were also replaced with tracts of four to six\nalanine residues. Mutant CD46 molecules were expressed in\nmouse OST-7 cells by using recombinant vaccinia virus, and\nbinding assays were performed with Sf9-H cells. Expression of\nall CD46 mutants on the surface of OST-7 cells was analyzed\nby \ufb02uorescence cytometry, and similar amounts of recombi-\nnant protein were expressed on all cells. Levels of mutant\nCD46 surface expression are presented in Table 2. Binding of\nSf9-H cells to OST-7 cells expressing mutant CD46 molecules\nwas measured colorimetrically with an ONPG assay, and the\nresults relative to those for normal CD46 are presented in Fig.\n4.\nSubstitution of charged amino acids at the SCR1 amino\nterminus (EE36/37AA and E45A) appeared to moderately\naffect binding and led to 25 to 30% inhibition of binding.\nMutation of the glycosylation site in SCR1 at Asn83 had no\neffect on binding, nor did mutations of the charged residues\nsurrounding this site. However, the mutation ER58/59AA dra-\nmatically inhibited binding, up to 80%. Mutation of RD103/\n104AA and another N-glycosylation site (N114A) in the SCR2\ndomain caused moderate but reproducible inhibition of bind-\ning, 25 and 50%, respectively. As previously stated, the Arg\nresidue at position 103 has been replaced by a Gln in baboons\n(Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas), and we and others have\nnoted that baboon erythrocytes are not nearly as effective in\nhemagglutination assays mediated by measles virus. Changes\nat amino acid 103 appear to diminish measles virus binding but\nnot abolish it. Another laboratory also recently reported that\nthe mutation at Asn114 destroyed this glycosylation site and\nreduced infections and binding by measles virus (44). 1t has not\nbeen shown whether this carbohydrate chain participates di-\nrectly or indirectly in binding. For the most part, single amino\nacid mutations do not completely abolish binding of mutant\nforms of CD46 to Sf9-H cells. This implies that several distinct\nregions in SCR1 and SCR2 cooperate in binding in a confor-\nmational rather than a linear manner and that no one region of\nSCR1 and SCR2 is critical for virus interaction.\nWe were surprised to observe that multiple substitutions of\nfour to six alanine residues at seven locations over the SCR1\nand SCR2 domains (E42 to G48, K49 to E55, E58 to C64, Y70\nFIG. 2. Analysis of SCR1 domains and CD46 molecules from erythrocytes of\nOld World and New World monkeys by \ufb02uorescence cytometry. Erythrocytes\nfrom monkeys were incubated with either preimmune antiserum, SCR1-speci\ufb01c\nantiserum, or polyclonal antiserum directed against human CD46. The erythro-\ncytes were subsequently washed twice with FACS buffer by low-speed centrifu-\ngation. Following resuspension of the pellet, the cells were incubated with FITC-\nlabeled goat anti-rabbit 1gG and again washed twice with FACS buffer by low-\nspeed centrifugation. The labeled erythrocyte pellet was resuspended in FACS\nbuffer and analyzed with a Becton Dickinson analyzer equipped with a 15-mW\nargon laser at 488 nm.

However, substitution\nof residues in the hinge region between the SCR1 and SCR2\ndomains (Y95 to T98) had little inhibitory effect. These\nchanges seem to indicate that major distortions of the SCR1\nand SCR2 domains cannot be tolerated in binding assays.\nAgain, the multiple substitutions did not affect display of the\nmutant CD46 molecules on the surface of the mouse OST-7\ncells (Table 2). 1t is quite possible that multiple alanine\nmutations might disrupt intramolecular disul\ufb01de bond for-\nmation and alter the native conformation of the virus bind-\ning domains.\nMonoclonal antibodies E4.3 and M75 inhibit binding of H\nprotein by interacting with speci\ufb01c regions in SCR1 and\nSCR2. Two monoclonal antibodies which react with CD46\nwere previously reported to block measles virus infections and\nprevent attachment of the measles virus H protein to the target\ncell (15, 30). We were able to map the regions on CD46 which\ninteract with monoclonal antibodies E4.3 and M75 by using\nrecombinant vaccinia virus expressing different CD46 mutants\n(Table 2) and to show that they inhibited binding of Sf9-H cells\n(Fig. 4). E4.3 inhibited binding of normal CD46 to Sf9-H cells\nby 45%, while M75 yielded 67% inhibition. 1n order to map the\nmonoclonal antibody epitopes, OST-7 cells were infected with\nvaccinia virus recombinants, and infected cell lysates were an-\nalyzed by immunoblotting with the two monoclonal antibodies;\ndiminished reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies with mu-\ntant CD46 molecules was noted (Table 2). E4.3 antibodies\nappeared to recognize residues 36 to 59 in the amino-terminal\ndomain of SCR1, while M75 recognized amino acids 103 to\n114. These epitopes coincided with the regions where site-\nspeci\ufb01c mutations had the most effect on virus binding. 1t will\nbe interesting to note the inhibitory effects of additional mono-\nclonal antibodies which recognize other regions of SCR1 and\nSCR2, when they become available.\nDISCUSSION\nCD46 was previously shown to be the receptor for the Ed-\nmonston strain of measles virus (15, 50). This paper expands\nupon the results from two other laboratories (30, 47), which\nclaimed that the presence of both the SCR1 and SCR2 do-\nmains of CD46 is suf\ufb01cient for virus binding. We proved that\nthis process occurs via direct interaction of the H protein with\nSCR1 and SCR2 by using a convenient binding assay with Sf9\ninsect cells expressing the viral surface protein, H. 1n our study\nwe were surprised to note that all New World monkeys which\nwere analyzed did not express the SCR1 domain in CD46\nmolecules present on their erythrocytes and lymphocytes. This\nobservation accounted for their inability to bind measles virus\nand hemagglutinate. The SCR1 deletion corresponds to a\nmissing second exon which is not retained in the CD46 mRNA\nduring the processing of precursor RNA; however, the exon\nstill appears to be present in chromosomal DNA (29), which\nimplies some irregularity in the splicing process. The compo-\nsitions of the STP and cytoplasmic domains of CD46 are\nknown to vary through a process of alternate splicing, but\nexons corresponding to the SCR domains have never been\nreported to be deleted through mRNA processing (62, 63, 71).\nNo functional role has yet been assigned to the SCR1 domain\nFIG. 3. Binding assay for mutant CD46 molecules by using insect cells expressing the H protein of measles virus. Mouse OST-7 cells were infected with wild-type\nvaccinia virus (A), vaccinia virus expressing the SCR1 domain, the STP region, and the CD46 transmembrane region (B), a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SCR1,\nSCR2, the STP domain, and the CD46 transmembrane domain (C), or a recombinant virus expressing the entire human CD46 molecule (D). OST-7 cells alone normally\ndo not bind measles virus. Sf9 insect cells infected with a baculovirus expressing measles H protein and b-galactosidase were incubated with Bluogal substrate, washed\nwith PBS, and added to the vaccinia virus-infected cells. Binding of blue-colored insect cells to mouse cells which expressed either SCR1 and SCR2 (C) or the entire\nhuman CD46 molecule (D) was apparent.\n6150\nHSU ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nof this molecule, since complement components C3b and C4b\nhave previously been demonstrated to interact with SCR2,\nSCR3, and SCR4 (1, 12, 30). A role in signal transduction has\nrecently been proposed for CD46, and it was shown that in-\nteraction of this receptor with measles virus or monoclonal\nantibodies speci\ufb01c for SCR1 could downregulate the produc-\ntion of interleukin-12 (32). This receptor interaction could\npartially account for the immunosuppressive effects of measles\nvirus. 1t remains to be determined if other cellular factors\nbesides measles virus interact with the SCR1 domain. The\ndeletion of SCR1 in most tissues of New World monkeys (29)\nmay have interesting evolutionary implications in terms of dis-\nease and immune regulation.\nErythrocytes from the baboon Papio cynocephalus have pre-\nviously been reported to hemagglutinate in the presence of\nlaboratory strains of measles virus (57, 59). However, research-\ners showed that many Old World monkey erythrocytes, includ-\ning those from Papio cynocephalus, M. fascicularis, M. mulatta,\nand E. patas, were less ef\ufb01cient in these assays than erythro-\ncytes from the African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops)\n(18\u201320). We con\ufb01rmed this result with two other species of\nbaboon (Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas) and found that\nthis decreased ability to hemagglutinate corresponded to a\nchange at amino acid residue 103, which implicates this region\nof CD46 in measles virus binding. We were able to imitate this\nnatural change through site-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis, and our ex-\nperiments revealed decreased af\ufb01nity for the mutant CD46 in\nan Sf9-H binding assay. The nearby carbohydrate attachment\nsite at Asn114 was also shown to be important for optimal\nbinding, since mutation of this residue to Ala also reduced\ninteraction with Sf9-H cells. 1n addition, the epitope for a\nmonoclonal antibody, M75, was mapped to the same region\n(amino acids 103 to 118) by using immunoblot analysis of our\nmutant CD46 molecules, and it was also shown to inhibit bind-\ning effectively. These preceding studies appear to implicate the\nregion of CD46 consisting of amino acids 103 to 118 as at least\none of the sites involved in virus attachment.\nThe arti\ufb01cial mutation in CD46 which changed GluArg at\npositions 58 and 59 to AlaAla had a dramatic effect on Sf9-H\ncell binding. This is a region which could be involved in elec-\ntrostatic interaction with the binding region of measles virus H\nprotein. Arginine at concentrations of 1 M has previously been\nshown to abrogate virus binding and hemagglutination (37).\nThe region at amino acid 58 or 59 could contribute to salt-\ndependent or charged residue interaction during the attach-\nment process (23, 37, 76). The monoclonal antibody E4.3 has\npreviously been studied in virus attachment experiments (30,\n47). There is some discrepancy between the results from the\ntwo laboratories as to the effectiveness of this antibody in\ninhibiting the binding of H protein to target cells, which could\nbe related to the concentration of the reagent used in their\nexperiments. Our results support those of Manchester et al.\n(47) and con\ufb01rm that E4.3 was indeed a potent inhibitor of\nmeasles virus H protein attachment. We further demonstrated\nthat the epitope for monoclonal antibody E4.3 mapped to a\nregion of CD46 between amino acids 37 and 59 by using im-\nmunoblot analysis of our mutant CD46 molecules. Taken to-\ngether, these data indicate that the region of CD46 consisting\nof amino acids 37 to 59 also participates in binding to the\nmeasles virus H protein.\nThe CD4 binding region (amino acids 39 to 59) which in-\nteracts with human immunode\ufb01ciency virus glycoprotein\n(gp120) has previously been mapped by other investigators\nthrough a series of site-speci\ufb01c mutations and interactions with\nmonoclonal antibodies (5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 31, 48, 60, 72, 79).\nSynthetic peptides were also employed by other laboratories in\nattempts to map binding regions on CD4 but led to contradic-\ntory results (31, 38, 39, 64, 83). Originally we also attempted to\nperform peptide studies with measles virus and CD46 by using\n25-amino-acid peptides derived from all regions of SCR1 and\nSCR2. Peptides at concentrations as high as 200 mM had no\neffect in Sf9-H binding and measles virus infectivity assays. We\npresumed that binding of measles virus depended on confor-\nmational epitopes rather than linear peptide epitopes. Subse-\nquently, a genetic approach using site-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis was\nadopted in our laboratory to map binding regions on CD46. 1nitially we found that large mutagenic changes involving mul-\nTABLE 2.

These mul-\ntiple mutations appeared to perturb binding of Sf9-H cells to\nCD46, no matter which region was targeted. Surface expres-\nsion of the mutated CD46 molecule was not affected, but\nintramolecular disul\ufb01de bond formation may have been al-\ntered. The only area where multiple alanine mutations did not\ndramatically affect binding was the hinge region between SCR1\nand SCR2, indicating that this region was relatively refractile\nto mutagenesis and probably was not important in measles\nvirus binding. Smaller point mutations were subsequently uti-\nlized in our experiments to map regions in SCR1 and SCR2\nwhich are important for measles virus binding.\nA molecular understanding of the exact interaction of mea-\nsles virus H protein with CD46 will ultimately depend upon\nstructural studies using nuclear magnetic resonance or X-ray\ncrystallography to dissect the binding regions of H, SCR1, and\nSCR2. Serum factor H, like CD46, is another complement\nbinding protein which is composed of 20 short consensus re-\ngions. The SCR15 and SCR16 regions of factor H, whose\nthree-dimensional structure has been solved (7), has some\nhomology to the two terminal domains of CD46. The polypep-\ntide backbone for CD46-SCR1 and CD46-SCR2 can be\ncrudely modeled and superimposed on that for the SCR15 and\nSCR16 domains from factor H. However, one can only approx-\nimate regions of interaction between the receptor and viral\nglycoprotein at this time. The \ufb01ne structure of the intramolec-\nular loops de\ufb01ned by the cysteine residues and the orientation\nof the SCR domains about the hinge region between SCR1 and\nSCR2 will likely determine the residues available in the bind-\ning site. Mutagenesis offers some clues as to which residues are\nimportant in virus binding, but these experiments are actually\na lead into structural studies.\nBased on the deletion of SCR1 regions in New World mon-\nkeys, we might predict that marmosets and tamarins from\nSouth America are resistant to infections by the Edmonston\nstrain of measles virus. Studies in our laboratory indicate that\nowl monkey kidney cells (OMK) and marmoset kidney cells\n(NZP-60) also contain this deletion and cannot be infected\nwith measles virus in the laboratory (29). However, we and\nothers (33) have infected a marmoset B-cell line which has\nbeen immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus (B95-8), and results\nindicate that these cells contain both the SCR1-deleted and\nnondeleted forms of CD46 (29).

This\nreceptor consists of four short consensus regions (SCR1 to SCR4) which normally function in complement\nregulation. Measles virus has recently been shown to interact with SCR1 and SCR2. In this study, receptors\non different types of monkey erythrocytes were employed as \u201cnatural mutant proteins\u201d to further de\ufb01ne the\nvirus binding regions of CD46. Erythrocytes from African green monkeys and rhesus macaques hemagglutinate\nin the presence of measles virus, while baboon erythrocytes were the least ef\ufb01cient of the Old World monkey\ncells used in these assays. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the SCR2 domain of baboon CD46 contained\nan Arg-to-Gln mutation at amino acid position 103 which accounted for reduced hemagglutination activity.\nSurprisingly, none of the New World monkey erythrocytes hemagglutinated in the presence of virus. Sequenc-\ning of cDNAs derived from the lymphocytes of these New World monkeys and analysis of their erythrocytes with\nSCR1-speci\ufb01c polyclonal antibodies indicated that the SCR1 domain was deleted in these cells. Additional\nexperiments, which used 35 different site-speci\ufb01c mutations inserted into CD46, were performed to complement\nthe preceding studies. The effects of these arti\ufb01cial mutations were documented with a convenient binding\nassay using insect cells expressing the measles virus hemagglutinin. Mutations which mimicked the change\nfound in baboon CD46 or another which deleted the SCR2 glycosylation site reduced binding substantially.\nAnother mutation which altered GluArg to AlaAla at positions 58 and 59, totally abolished binding. Finally, the\nepitopes for two monoclonal antibodies which inhibit measles virus attachment were mapped to the same\nregions implicated by mutagenesis.\nCD46, also known as membrane cofactor protein, was re-\ncently shown to be a primate-speci\ufb01c receptor for the labora-\ntory-adapted Edmonston strain of measles virus (15, 16, 22,\n50). This surface glycoprotein is expressed on most types of\ncells and normally functions as a regulator of complement\nactivity and helps to protect self tissue from autoimmune de-\nstruction (40, 41). CD46 is composed of four extracellular\nshort consensus domains (SCR1, SCR2, SCR3, and SCR4)\nfollowed by a region rich in serine, threonine, and proline\n(called STP), a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic\ndomain at its carboxyl terminus. Variations in splicing of exons\nencoding STP cassettes and cytoplasmic regions yield glyco-\nproteins which vary in size from 57 to 67 kDa and consist of all\nfour SCR domains, a combination of STP regions, and one of\ntwo different possible carboxy termini (62, 63, 71). Each of the\nknown splicing variants of human CD46 is capable of binding\nmeasles virus (21, 46).\nThe CD46 binding domains for the laboratory-adapted Ed-\nmonston strain of measles virus have recently been mapped to\nSCR1 and SCR2 (47) by using chimeric recombinant mole-\ncules composed of parts of CD46 and a related molecule called\nCD55, or decay-accelerating factor. Another group has done\nsimilar experiments with chimeras of CD46 and CD4 (11),\nwhile others expressed CD46 deletion mutants in Chinese\nhamster ovary cells (30) and con\ufb01rmed the role of SCR1 and\nSCR2 in virus binding. Monoclonal antibodies speci\ufb01c for\nSCR1 and SCR2 also block measles virus binding to the host\ncell (30, 47). The role of carbohydrate linked to the asparagine\nresidue in the SCR1 domain of CD46 appears to be minimal,\nwhile carbohydrate associated with asparagine in SCR2 ap-\npears to be critical for binding measles virus (42, 43).\nMeasles virus (25, 78) is a paramyxovirus which consists of a\nnegative-strand RNA genome and an envelope which contains\ntwo surface glycoproteins known as hemagglutinin protein (H)\nand membrane fusion protein (F). A nonglycosylated mem-\nbrane protein (M) lies on the imer side of the envelope and\nmediates an association of the glycoproteins with the nucleo-\ncapsid of the virus. H protein is responsible for virus attach-\nment and interacts with CD46 (4, 14, 42), while F mediates\npenetration and syncytium formation (45, 65, 67, 70, 82). In-\nteraction of H with its receptor has been shown to downregu-\nlate surface CD46 in cultured cells (28, 35, 49, 73\u201375), and four\namino acids on the virus attachment protein have recently\nbeen implicated in this interaction (8). In addition, virus grown\nin cultured cells binds to the receptors on many, but not all,\nspecies of monkey erythrocytes to yield hemagglutination (20,\n53\u201355, 57\u201359, 69). Hemagglutination assays with erythrocytes\nfrom cercopithecus and rhesus monkeys have traditionally\nbeen used to determine titers of laboratory strains of measles\n* Corresponding author.

However, the\nerythrocytes of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas do not hem-\nagglutinate in the presence of measles virus, which correlates\nwith the absence of CD46 on the surfaces of erythrocytes from\nthese higher primates (19, 52).\nSince a number of species of monkey erythrocytes vary in\ntheir ability to bind measles virus and subsequently hemagglu-\ntinate (18\u201320), we proposed to use the receptors on these\nerythrocytes as \u201cnatural mutant proteins\u201d in an attempt to\nfurther de\ufb01ne the binding regions of CD46. In this work, we\n\ufb01rst studied the ability of New World and Old World monkey\nerythrocytes to hemagglutinate in the presence of measles vi-\nrus. Surprisingly, none of the New World monkey erythrocytes\nhemagglutinated in the presence of measles virus, although it\nwas evident that they expressed CD46 on their cell surfaces.\nThe CD46 molecules from the lymphocytes and erythrocytes of\nNew World monkeys all lacked the SCR1 coding region adja-\ncent to the amino-terminal signal peptide. A speci\ufb01c mutation\npresent within the CD46 molecules of baboons which could\naccount for diminished hemagglutination activity in the pres-\nence of measles virus was noted. In addition, the effects of\ncertain arti\ufb01cial mutations introduced into CD46 by site-spe-\nci\ufb01c mutagenesis are reported.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell lines and virus. HeLa, Vero, and HuTK-143B cells were purchased from\nthe American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.). Sf9 insect cells were\nsupplied by Invitrogen (San Diego, Calif.) and were grown in Grace\u2019s medium.\nHeLa, Vero, and HuTK-143B cells were propagated in Dulbecco\u2019s minimum\nessential medium (GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.) supplemented with 10%\nfetal calf serum. In addition, HuTK-143B cells were cultivated in the presence of\n12.5 mg of bromodeoxyuridine per ml. Monkey (cercopithecus, cynomologus, and\nrhesus) erythrocytes were purchased from Comaught Laboratories (Toronto,\nCanada), and baboon erythrocytes came from Lampire Biological Laboratories\n(Pipersville, Pa.). Other monkey erythrocytes were obtained from the Granby\nZoo (Granby, Canada), the Montreal Biodome (Montreal, Canada), the Quebec\nCity Zoo (Quebec City, Canada), the Toronto Metropolitan Zoo (Toronto,\nCanada), the National Institutes of Health primate center (Poolesville, Md.),\nMerck-Frosst Pharmaceuticals (Montreal, Canada), and the New England Pri-\nmate Center (Boston, Mass.). The Edmonston strain of measles virus was orig-\ninally obtained from Erling Norrby (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden)\nand was propagated in Vero monkey kidney cells as previously described (24).\nCD46 polypeptide expression and production of antibodies. Polyclonal anti-\nbodies (CD46-333) directed against entire CD46 protein and antiserum directed\nagainst the SCR1 domain of CD46 protein were prepared by immunization of\nrabbits with puri\ufb01ed recombinant protein. The entire CD46-coding region (iso-\ntype C2) was synthesized by PCR with oligonucleotide primers as previously\ndescribed (15). The DNA fragment was cloned into the NheI site of the bacu-\nlovirus expression vector BlueBac2 (pETL), and recombinant baculovirus was\ngenerated (36, 68, 80). Recombinant CD46 protein was expressed in Sf9 insect\ncells, resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, electro-\neluted, and injected into rabbits to generate a polyclonal antibody by routine\nmethods (66, 81). A DNA fragment containing SCR1 was synthesized by PCR\nwith\noligonucleotide\nprimers\ncorresponding\nto\nthe\n59\nend\n(59-AACGGATCCT-GTGAGGAGCCACCAACA-39)\nand\nthe\n39\nend\n(59-TGGTGTTCGAAAATTGTCCGCAGTAGA-CTCTG-39) of the SCR1-\ncoding sequence. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and\nthen cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pT7-7His cut with the same\nenzymes (77). The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli\nBL21(DE3) by electroporation, and the recombinant protein was expressed by\ninduction with 0.4 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The SCR1\npolypeptide fused to His6 was puri\ufb01ed by metal chelation chromotography with\nNi-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions (61). Pu-\nri\ufb01ed SCR1 polypeptide was injected into rabbits for the production of poly-\nclonal antibodies (27). In addition, the monoclonal antibody E4.3 (speci\ufb01c for\nSCR1) was purchased from Bio/Can Scienti\ufb01c (Mississauga, Canada), and mono-\nclonal antibody M75 (speci\ufb01c for SCR2) came from Seikugaku Inc. (Tokyo,\nJapan).\nHemagglutination of different primate erythrocytes by measles virus. Primate\nblood samples were collected from animals in Vacutainer tubes containing hep-\narin-EDTA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) and stored in Alsevier\u2019s\nsolution (GIBCO-BRL) for no more than 2 days. Cells were washed two times\nwith phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and a 1% (vol/vol) solution was used in\nthe hemagglutination assays. A standard sample of concentrated measles virus\n(107 PFU/ml) was diluted serially (1:1) with PBS, and 50 ml of each dilution was\nadded to individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate with round-bottom cham-\nbers (Costar, Cambridge, Mass.). A 50-ml sample of the erythrocytes was added\nto each well. Hemagglutination was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Erythro-\ncytes settled to the bottom of the chambers when the assay was negative but\nformed a suspended matrix when the assay was positive. The assay titer was the\nhighest dilution of virus which produced hemagglutination.\nIsolation of monkey lymphocytes and synthesis of cDNAs from CD46 mRNA.\nLymphocytes from different monkey species were prepared by using a Ficoll-\nPaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) discontinuous gradient. Fresh monkey\nblood (2 to 3 ml) was diluted with an equal volume of balanced salt solution\n(0.01% anhydrous D-glucose, 5 mM CaCl2, 98 mM MgCl2, 0.545 mM KCl, 0.126\nM NaCl, and 14.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and layered onto 3 ml of Ficoll-Paque.\nThe sample was centrifuged at 700 3 g for 30 min at 20\u00b0C. The lymphocyte layer\nat the balanced salt solution\u2013Ficoll-Paque interface was collected and diluted\nwith 3 volumes of balanced salt solution. Following centrifugation at 700 3 g for\n10 min at 20\u00b0C, the lymphocyte pellet was washed once with 1 ml of balanced salt\nsolution and then resuspended in 1 ml of TRIzol (GIBCO-BRL). Chloroform\n(0.2 ml) was added, and the TRIzol lysate was vortexed and left for 3 min at room\ntemperature. The denatured extract was centrifuged at 10,000 3 g for 10 min at\n4\u00b0C. RNA in the upper aqueous layer was then precipitated with 0.5 ml of\nisopropanol at room temperature for 10 min and then concentrated by centrif-\nugation at 10,000 3 g for 10 min. Finally, the pellet was washed once with 75%\nethanol, dried in the air, and resuspended in 50 ml of H2O. Synthesis of cDNA\nwas performed from mRNA by using the First Strand Synthesis kit (Pharmacia)\nand a speci\ufb01c CD46 primer (59-GGGACAACACAAATTACTGC-39). Double-\nstranded DNA fragments were generated by nested PCRs. Primers derived from\nthe\nhuman\nCD46\nsequence\ncorresponding\nto\n59-GCAACTCCAACAACTATGGC-39\nand\n59-AGTGTCCCTTTCCTTCCTG-39 were used for the \ufb01rst 30 rounds of PCR\nampli\ufb01cation.\nInterior,\nor\nnested,\nprimers\ncorresponding\nto\n59-ACAATCACAGCAATGACCCA-39\nand\n59-CGCTTTCCTGGGTTGCTTC-39 of human CD46 were used for the follow-\ning 30 rounds of PCR.\nDetermination of the 5*-terminal sequences of CD46 mRNA. The 59-terminal\ncoding regions of different monkey CD46 molecules were determined by using\nthe Marathon cDNA Ampli\ufb01cation Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) as described\nin the reference manual. Poly(A)1 RNA was \ufb01rst isolated from total RNA by\nusing a QuickPrep mRNA puri\ufb01cation kit (Pharmacia). Reverse transcriptase\n(RT) and an oligo(dT) primer were used to synthesize the \ufb01rst-strand cDNA\nfrom 1 mg of poly(A)1 RNA. The second-strand DNA was synthesized by using\na mixture of RNase H, DNA polymerase I, DNA ligase, and then T4 DNA\npolymerase (26). The Marathon cDNA adapter was ligated to the double-\nstranded DNA after synthesis of second-strand cDNA. Monkey CD46 fragment\ncontaining the 59 coding region was generated by nested PCR with a human\nCD46-speci\ufb01c primer (59-TAAGACACTTTGGAACTGGG-39) and the Mara-\nthon\ncDNA\nadapter-speci\ufb01c\nprimer\nAP1\n(59-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-39) for the \ufb01rst 30 rounds of\nPCR and with a human CD46-speci\ufb01c nested primer (59--39) and the Marathon\ncDNA\nadapter-speci\ufb01c\nnested\nprimer\nAP2\n(59-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-39) for the next 30 rounds of PCR\nampli\ufb01cation. CD46 DNA fragments from the different monkeys were rendered\nblunt with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, Calif.) and then cloned into\nthe SrfI site of the PCR Script Amp (SK1) vector (Stratagene).\nSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. SDS-poly-\nacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblot analysis were per-\nformed as previously described (81). The E4.3 and M75 monoclonal antibodies\n(1:500 dilution) were incubated with nitrocellulose paper blotted with total\nproteins from OST-7 cells infected with mutant CD46 recombinant virus. Bind-\ning of monoclonal antibodies was detected by ECL chemiluminescence (Amer-\nsham, Arlington Heights, Ill.).\nDNA sequencing. DNA fragments contained in PCR-Script AmP (SK(1)\nvectors were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems 430I automated sequencer\nlocated at the Amgen DNA sequencing facility (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif.).\nSequence analysis and alignments were performed with Lasergene software\n(DNASTAR, Madison, Wis.).\nFlow cytometry analysis of monkey erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Monkey\nblood (50 ml) was centrifuged at 1,500 3 g for 5 min, washed twice with 5 ml of\n\ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine\nserum albumin, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% sodium azide). The erythrocytes were\nresuspended in 100 ml of the same buffer containing a 1:100 dilution of either\npreimmune antibody, CD46-333 antibody, or SCR1 antibody for 1 h on ice.\nFollowing the incubation, cells were washed twice with 3 ml of FACS buffer by\ncentrifugation at 1,500 3 g for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in 100 ml of the\nsame buffer containing a 1:100 dilution of \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-\nlabeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (heavy plus light chains) for 1 h on\nice. After being washed twice with 3 ml of FACS buffer, the blood cells were\nsuspended in 0.5 ml of FACS buffer and were subsequently analyzed on a Becton\nDickinson analyzer equipped with a 15-mW argon laser at 488 nm. The data were\ncollected and analyzed with CellQuest software.\nMonkey lymphocytes were also analyzed by \ufb02ow cytometry. The monkey blood\nsamples were prepared and labeled as described above. Following the incubation\nVOL. 71, 1997\nCD46 REGIONS IMPORTANT FOR MEASLES VIRUS BINDING\n6145\n\nwith FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, the cells were washed and resuspended in 100\nml of FACS buffer. Erythrocytes were lysed by treatment of each sample with 1\nml of FACS lysis buffer (Becton Dickinson) for 1 min. The lymphocytes were\nwashed twice with 3 ml of FACS buffer, and monkey lymphocyte \ufb02uorescence\ndata were collected as described in the previous paragraph. Mouse OST7 cells\n(2 3 106 cells) which expressed mutant forms of CD46 were suspended in 1 ml\nof Cell Dissociation Buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and washed two times by\ncentrifugation with FACS buffer. The \ufb01nal pellet was suspended in 100 ml of\nFACS buffer prior to analysis by \ufb02uorescence cytometry.\nSite-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis of CD46 and expression of mutants by using vac-\ncinia virus recombinants. Portions of SCR1 and SCR2 domains were replaced\nwith point mutations or four to six alanine residues by using gel-puri\ufb01ed oligo-\nnucleotides consisting of 30 to 40 nucleotides. Mutations were introduced into\nthe CD46 molecule by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from\nStratagene. The CD46-coding region (isotype C2) was cloned into PCR-Script\nAmp SK(1) plasmid, denatured, and amealed with two complementary oligo-\nnucleotides containing the desired mutation; the mutagenized DNA strands were\nextended with Pfu polymerase; the methylated nonmutated parental DNA tem-\nplate was digested with DpnI; and the mutated plasmid was used to transform\nXL2-Blue ultracompetent cells. Mutant plasmids were isolated, and the CD46\ninserts were completely sequenced. The mutagenized CD46-coding regions were\nexcised from the PCR-Script plasmid following digestion with BspHI (59 end)\nand BglII (39 end) and ligated into the vaccinia virus vector pTM1 (containing the\nT7 promoter) which had been digested with the compatible restriction enzymes\nNcoI and BamHI. Vaccinia virus recombinants were prepared and titers were\ndetermined by plaque assays as previously described, using HuTK-143B cells and\nbromodeoxyuridine selection (17). CD46 mutants were expressed in mouse\nOST-7 cells which contained the T7 polymerase, and protein synthesis and\nsurface expression were monitored by Western immunoblot and FACS scan\nanalysis.\nDirect binding assays between CD46 mutants and insect cells expressing\nmeasles virus H protein. Mutant CD46-coding sequences were cloned into the\npTM1 vaccinia virus expression vector, which uses the T7 promoter to direct\ntranscription of the foreign gene. Recombinant vaccinia virus was prepared as\npreviously described (17), and mutant CD46 molecules were expressed in mouse\nOST7 cells which contain the T7 polymerase. Sf9 insect cells were infected for\n48 h with a recombinant baculovirus (81) which had been generated with the\nBlueBac2 expression vector (Invitrogen) (36, 68) and synthesized both the mea-\nsles virus H protein and b-galactosidase. The insect cells were colored blue by\nadding Bluogal (GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, N.Y.), at 36 h of infection, from a\nstock solution (50 mg/ml in dimethylformamide) to give a 0.05% (wt/vol) \ufb01nal\nconcentration. Infections with recombinant vaccinia virus were allowed to pro-\nceed for 12 h; Sf9 insect cells expressing the measles H protein and b-galacto-\nsidase were incubated for 1/2 h with the vaccinia virus-infected mouse OST7 cells\nin the presence of PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum. Nonadsorbed insect cells\nwere eluted by washing the mouse cells two times with PBS. Binding in 25-cm2\ntissue culture \ufb02asks could be quantitated visually under a microscope or quan-\ntitatively by the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenylgalactoside (ONPG) with a b-galac-\ntosidase assay kit (Stratagene). Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of 100 mM sodium\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% Nonidet P-40.\nAliquots of lysate (50 ml) were added to a 96-well microtitration plate, and\nfreshly prepared buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4,\n50 mM b-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) was mixed with each aliquot to give a \ufb01nal\nvolume of 160 ml. A 50-ml volume of ONPG solution (4 mg/ml in 100 mM sodium\nphosphate, pH 7.5) was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C until a yellow\ncolor was evident, after about 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition\nof 90 ml of 1 M Na2CO3, and the color intensity was measured at 420 nm with a\nSpectraMax 250 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader purchased\nfrom Molecular Devices (Sumyvale, Calif.). Results were linear over time for an\nabsorbance range of 0.1 to 1 A420 unit.\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The nucleotide sequences coding for\nthe extracellular domains of monkey CD46 molecules were submitted to Gen-\nBank and have the following accession numbers: Aotus trivirgatus, U87914; Papio\nhamadryas, U87915; Callimico goeldii, U87916; Callithrix jacchus, U87917; Sagui-\nnus mystax, U87918; Saimiri sciureus, U87919; Cercopithecus aethiops, U87920;\nMacaca fascicularis, U87921; Macaca mulatta, U87922; and Pithecia pithecia,\nU87923.\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of CD46 surface expression and hemagglutination\nof primate erythrocytes in the presence of Edmonston measles\nvirus. Certain monkey erythrocytes are known to bind measles\nvirus and have been routinely used to determine titers of mea-\nsles virus in hemagglutination assays (19, 56). However, it is\nknown that human and chimpanzee erythrocytes do not hem-\nagglutinate in the presence of measles virus (19, 54). This can\nnow be attributed to the fact that the erythrocytes of humans,\ngorillas, and chimpanzees do not have CD46, the receptor for\nmeasles virus, on their cell surfaces (52). African green mon-\nkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) erythrocytes are known to be most\nsensitive to measles virus-induced agglutination (18, 20, 69).\nWe collected erythrocytes from a number of Old World and\nNew World monkeys and assayed their ability to hemaggluti-\nnate in the presence of Edmonston measles virus which had\nbeen propagated in Vero monkey kidney cells (Table 1). The\npresence of CD46 on the surfaces of these monkey erythro-\ncytes was \ufb01rst veri\ufb01ed by \ufb02uorescence analysis with a poly-\nclonal antibody speci\ufb01c for human CD46. All primate eryth-\nrocytes which were tested, with the exception of human and\nchimpanzee erythrocytes, bound the CD46 antibody. Levels of\nimmune recognition were probably less in Lemur macaco due\nto species-speci\ufb01c variation of its CD46 protein. Hemaggluti-\nnation assays mediated by measles virus were performed, and\nit was obvious that erythrocytes from South American marmo-\nsets and tamarins (Callimico goeldii, Callithrix jacchus, Pithecia\npithecia, Saimiri sciureus, and Leontopithecus rosalia) and\nMadagascar lemur failed to bind measles virus (Table 1). Old\nWorld monkey erythrocytes varied in their ability to hemag-\nglutinate in the presence of the virus. As expected, human and\nchimpanzee erythrocytes did not hemagglutinate, while Cerco-\npithecus aethiops, Cercopithecus diana, M. fascicularis, M. mu-\nlatta, Erythrocebus patas, and Cercocebus torquatus lunulatus\nyielded high hemagglutination titers. Cercopithecus monkeys\nconsistently yielded slightly higher hemagglutination titers\nthan the rest of the monkeys, as previously reported (18, 20).\nOn the other hand, erythrocytes from baboons (Papio anubis\nand Papio hamadryas) always produced much lower titers in\nTABLE 1.

Preimmune rabbit antibody yielded\na background \ufb02uorescence of 0.200 to 0.500.\nb Hemagglutination titers were measured in microtiter plates with standard\nconcentrated measles virus from culture medium diluted serially by one-half in\nPBS buffer; an equal volume of a 1% (vol/vol) suspension of monkey erythrocytes\nwas added to each well, and the assay mixture was allowed to incubate for 2 h at\n4\u00b0C. The larger dilution indicated an increased ability of the erythrocytes to\nhemagglutinate in the presence of measles virus; less virus was required to\ncross-link erythrocytes and maintain them in suspension. Assays with Old World\nmonkey erythrocytes were performed four times and averaged.\n6146\nHSU ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nour assays. We proposed to isolate mRNA from the lympho-\ncytes of these monkeys, synthesize cDNA, and sequence the\nregions coding for the extracellular domains of CD46 in an\nattempt to explain the species-speci\ufb01c variation in hemagglu-\ntination titers exhibited by these different erythrocytes.\nSequence comparisons of CD46 extracellular domains from\ndifferent primates. Lymphocytes were isolated from the blood\nof different monkeys, and cDNAs were prepared by using\nspeci\ufb01c primers and RT, followed by PCR (RT-PCR). The\npredicted amino acid sequence was deduced from at least\nthree separate PCRs for each type of monkey. Subsequently,\nthe signal peptide and short consensus regions (SCR1 to\nSCR4) were aligned by using the Clustal program from Laser-\ngene (Fig. 1). Overall, the CD46 molecules from the different\nprimates were highly conserved, and the protein sequences of\nthe SCR3 and SCR4 regions from all the primates were ex-\ntremely similar. The SCR3 and SCR4 domains of Old World\nmacaques exhibited 93% identity to the human sequence,\nFIG. 1. Amino acid sequence alignment of signal peptides and short consensus regions from CD46 molecules found in lymphocytes of Old World and New World\nmonkeys. Blood samples were obtained from a variety of primates originating from either Africa or South America. Lymphocytes were isolated by gradient\ncentrifugation, total RNA was extracted, and cDNA was prepared with RT by using speci\ufb01c oligonucleotide primers from the conserved STP and transmembrane\ndomains. DNA sequences were ampli\ufb01ed by using conserved oligonucleotides upstream of the signal peptide region and regions adjacent to the SCR4 regions. The\n59 ends of New World monkeys were also cloned by rapid ampli\ufb01cation of cDNA ends with a conserved primer from the SCR3 region. At least three independent cDNA\nclones were sequenced, translated to yield a predicted protein, and aligned by using the Clustal method in the Lasergene DNA analysis package. Residues which differ\nfrom the human consensus are shaded. Old World primates include humans (Homo sapiens), cynomolgus monkeys (M. fascicularis), rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta),\nbaboons (Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas), and African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops). New World primates which we tested were the common marmoset\n(Callithrix jacchus), Goeldii\u2019s marmoset (Callimico goeldii), the moustached marmoset (Saguinus mystax), the white-faced saki (Pithecia pithecia), the owl monkey (A.\ntrivirgatus), and the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). The signal peptide and SCR1, SCR2, and SCR3 regions are indicated by solid lines beneath the sequences. The\nSCR4 domain is not shown, since it was very similar for all monkeys tested. The mutation found in baboon CD46 at amino acid 103 is highlighted by a solid box.\nVOL. 71, 1997\nCD46 REGIONS IMPORTANT FOR MEASLES VIRUS BINDING\n6147\n\nwhile those of New World monkeys were 80% identical. This\nconservation seems consistent with the role of these regions of\nCD46 in complement regulation (40, 41). Since the SCR4\nsequence is very similar for all monkeys, it is not shown in Fig.\n1. The conserved amino-terminal signal peptides, STP regions,\nand membrane-spaming regions facilitated RT-PCR across\nthe extracellular domain of CD46. It was immediately evident\nthat the coding region for SCR1 (consisting of 63 amino acids)\nwas missing from the cDNAs derived from the mRNAs of New\nWorld monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, Pithecia pithecia, Callimico\ngoeldii, A. trivirgatus, and Saimiri sciureus). The observation\nthat the SCR1-coding region was missing from mRNAs of\nlymphocytes and erythrocyte precursors of New World mon-\nkeys explains why the erythrocytes of New World monkeys did\nnot hemagglutinate in the presence of measles virus, since this\nregion has previously been implicated in measles virus binding\n(30, 47). The SCR2 region varied most from the human se-\nquence for both Old World and New World monkeys. This\nregion was 73% identical to the human SCR2 for Old World\nmonkeys and 68% identical for New World monkeys. Con-\nserved regions of identity might be expected to participate in\nbinding to the measles virus H protein.\nThe CD46 sequences for different classes of Old and New\nWorld monkeys resembled each other and could clearly be\nused to classify the primates into different groups. Baboons,\nmacaques, and African green monkeys belong to the family\nCercopithecidae (51), and all have similar changes at 28 posi-\ntions in the signal peptide and SCR regions when compared to\nthe same extracellular portion of human CD46. Bands of\namino acid identity at over 22 positions could easily differen-\ntiate whether the CD46 sequence belonged to an Old or New\nWorld monkey. South American monkeys could be further\nsubclassi\ufb01ed on the basis of 10 additional variations in the\nsequence shown in Fig. 1. Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus and\nCallimico goeldii) and tamarins (Saguinus mystax, Saguinus oe-\ndipus, and Leontipithecus rosalia) belong to the Callithrichidae\nfamily (51). On the other hand, squirrel monkeys (Saimiri\nsciureus), owl monkeys (A. trivirgatus), and white-faced sakis\n(Pithecia pithecia) are members of the Cebidae family (51).\nThese family af\ufb01liations are re\ufb02ected in amino acid variations\nfound in the external domains of CD46 (Fig. 1).\nCD46 sequences from baboons contained only seven amino\nacid changes when compared to the cercopithecus monkey\nsequence; six of these changes (positions 71, 92, 106, 113, 149,\nand 172) were conservative, but the other change, at position\n103, produced an Arg-to-Gln substitution. This change might\naccount for the reduced hemagglutination properties of ba-\nboon erythrocytes and was considered in subsequent studies.\nCynomolgus (M. fascicularis) and rhesus (M. mulatta) monkey\nCD46 sequences were almost identical to the sequence of\nCercopithecus aethiops, and all changes were minor and con-\nservative. A slightly greater level of CD46 cell surface expres-\nsion on the erythrocytes of Cercopithecus aethiops and Cerco-\npithecus diana could explain the consistent difference in\nhemagglutination between cercopithecus monkeys and ma-\ncaques (Table 1). It should also be noted that the Edmonston\nstrain of measles virus has been routinely propagated in Vero\nand CV-1 cells, which are derived from the kidneys of an\nAfrican green monkey. Propagation of this laboratory strain in\nculture would ultimately favor the binding of measles virus to\nthe Cercophithecus aethiops CD46 receptor over those of other\nmonkeys.\nConserved blocks of amino acids in the SCR1 and SCR2\nregions could give some clues as to which regions are most\nimportant in binding to measles virus. SCR1 regions between\namino acids 37 to 54 and 56 to 91 seem to be almost identical\nin the Old World monkeys. In addition, SCR2 regions consist-\ning of residues 96 to 99, 103 to 109, 113 to 117, 124 to 135, 137\nto 144, and 146 to 162 are almost identical in CD46 molecules\nfrom the Old World monkeys and could contribute to virus\nbinding. Glycosylation sites at Asn83 and Asn114 are abso-\nlutely retained, 6 of 8 cysteine residues are conserved, and the\n13 prolines are maintained at all positions except residues 100,\n104, and 112. It was interesting that baboons, macaques, and\nAfrican green monkeys contained another potential glycosyla-\ntion site in their SCR3 domain at residue 213. However, this\nshould not affect binding to H, since this region of CD46 does\nnot appear to interact with the virus during attachment.\nPolyclonal antibodies con\ufb01rm that the SCR1 region is ab-\nsent from CD46 molecules expressed on the erythrocytes and\nlymphocytes from New World monkeys. SCR1 polypeptides\n(amino acids 30 to 91) derived from CD46 were expressed in E.\ncoli, and recombinant protein was puri\ufb01ed and injected into\nrabbits in order to generate polyclonal antibodies. These anti-\nbodies were used to study surface expression of SCR1 on\nerythrocytes, lymphocytes, and a number of cell lines from Old\nand New World monkeys by \ufb02uorescent-antibody analysis. A\npolyclonal antibody directed against the entire CD46 molecule\nindicated that the erythrocytes from most Old and all New\nWorld monkeys express CD46 on their cell surface (Fig. 2).\nHowever, SCR1-speci\ufb01c antibodies clearly con\ufb01rmed that the\nerythrocytes of Old World monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops,\nM. mulatta, M. fascicularis, and Papio anubis) expressed the\nSCR1 domain of CD46 on their surface (Fig. 2A), while anal-\nysis of New World monkeys (A. trivirgatus, Saimiri sciureus,\nCallithrix jacchus, and Saguinus oedipus) showed that it was\nabsent (Fig. 2B). Analysis of lymphocytes, following lysis of\nerythrocytes, gave identical results (data not shown). This re-\nsult con\ufb01rmed our RT-PCR analysis of mRNA derived from\nlymphocytes and explained why New World monkey erythro-\ncytes did not hemagglutinate in the presence of the laboratory\nstrain of Edmonston measles virus, since the SCR1 domain has\nbeen implicated in measles virus binding (30, 47).\nA convenient binding assay with Sf9 insect cells expressing\nmeasles virus H protein and b-galactosidase can be used to\nstudy the binding domains of CD46. Our laboratory previously\ndemonstrated that Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant\nbaculovirus expressing the measles virus H protein (Sf9-H)\nwere capable of binding to erythrocytes from African green\nmonkeys (80). Since recombinant baculovirus was derived by\nusing the BlueBac2 (pETL) expression vector (36, 68), the\ninsect cells expressed b-galactosidase as well as measles virus\nH protein. We reasoned that these infected Sf9 cells grown in\nsuspension should be capable of binding to mammalian cells\nwith CD46 at their cell surface. Preliminary studies demon-\nstrated that Sf9-H cells could indeed bind to HeLa cells and in\naddition could be stained blue in the presence of Bluogal, a\nsubstrate for b-galactosidase (29). Control Sf9 insect cells in-\nfected with wild-type Autographa californica nuclear polyhe-\ndrosis virus did not adhere to target cells and could be washed\naway. A mouse cell line containing the T7 polymerase gene\n(OST-7) does not normally bind measles virus. When infected\nwith a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing human CD46\nunder control of the T7 promoter, these rodent cells could bind\nthe Sf9-H cells (Fig. 3D). Mouse cells infected with wild-type\nvaccinia virus or a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the\nSCR1, STP, and transmembrane regions of CD46 could not\nbind the Sf9-H cells (Fig. 3A and B). However, mouse OST-7\ncells infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the\nSCR1, SCR2, STP, and transmembrane regions (Fig. 3C)\ncould bind Sf9-H cells just as well as if they were infected with\nvaccinia virus synthesizing the whole CD46 molecule (Fig. 3D).\n6148\nHSU ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nThese results con\ufb01rm previous \ufb01ndings (11, 30, 47) which show\nthat both the SCR1 and SCR2 domains of CD46 are required\nfor measles virus binding. The results presented in Fig. 3 attest\nto the credibility of this assay and establish a simple direct\nbinding assay for interaction between measles virus H protein\nand the human CD46 molecule. Previous investigators moni-\ntored this binding indirectly through the ability of measles virus\nto initiate infection in rodent cells expressing CD46 variants\n(47), \ufb02uorescence microscopy with measles antibodies (47),\n\ufb02uorescence cytometry measurements with H monoclonal an-\ntibody (30, 50), or the ability to form rosettes between African\ngreen monkey erythrocytes and the CD46-bearing target cell\n(15) or semiquantitatively with a biotinylated H protein overlay\nbinding assay with nitrocellulose blots containing CD46 (42).\nOur new binding assay with Sf9-H cells offers the advantages of\nbeing quick, sensitive, and easy to quantitate with either Bluo-\ngal or ONPG substrates.\nSite-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis can be used to map regions of\nCD46 important for interaction of the H protein. Binding of\nmeasles virus to African green monkey erythrocytes has pre-\nviously been reported to be reversed by incubation with 1 M\narginine, and consequently, electrostatic interactions appeared\nto be important in virus attachment (37). With this result in\nmind, we decided to initiate our mutagenesis studies by sys-\ntematically replacing charged amino acids in the SCR1 and\nSCR2 domains with alanine. Larger stretches of the CD46\nbinding domains were also replaced with tracts of four to six\nalanine residues. Mutant CD46 molecules were expressed in\nmouse OST-7 cells by using recombinant vaccinia virus, and\nbinding assays were performed with Sf9-H cells. Expression of\nall CD46 mutants on the surface of OST-7 cells was analyzed\nby \ufb02uorescence cytometry, and similar amounts of recombi-\nnant protein were expressed on all cells. Levels of mutant\nCD46 surface expression are presented in Table 2. Binding of\nSf9-H cells to OST-7 cells expressing mutant CD46 molecules\nwas measured colorimetrically with an ONPG assay, and the\nresults relative to those for normal CD46 are presented in Fig.\n4.\nSubstitution of charged amino acids at the SCR1 amino\nterminus (EE36/37AA and E45A) appeared to moderately\naffect binding and led to 25 to 30% inhibition of binding.\nMutation of the glycosylation site in SCR1 at Asn83 had no\neffect on binding, nor did mutations of the charged residues\nsurrounding this site. However, the mutation ER58/59AA dra-\nmatically inhibited binding, up to 80%. Mutation of RD103/\n104AA and another N-glycosylation site (N114A) in the SCR2\ndomain caused moderate but reproducible inhibition of bind-\ning, 25 and 50%, respectively. As previously stated, the Arg\nresidue at position 103 has been replaced by a Gln in baboons\n(Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas), and we and others have\nnoted that baboon erythrocytes are not nearly as effective in\nhemagglutination assays mediated by measles virus. Changes\nat amino acid 103 appear to diminish measles virus binding but\nnot abolish it. Another laboratory also recently reported that\nthe mutation at Asn114 destroyed this glycosylation site and\nreduced infections and binding by measles virus (44). It has not\nbeen shown whether this carbohydrate chain participates di-\nrectly or indirectly in binding. For the most part, single amino\nacid mutations do not completely abolish binding of mutant\nforms of CD46 to Sf9-H cells. This implies that several distinct\nregions in SCR1 and SCR2 cooperate in binding in a confor-\nmational rather than a linear mamer and that no one region of\nSCR1 and SCR2 is critical for virus interaction.\nWe were surprised to observe that multiple substitutions of\nfour to six alanine residues at seven locations over the SCR1\nand SCR2 domains (E42 to G48, K49 to E55, E58 to C64, Y70\nFIG. 2. Analysis of SCR1 domains and CD46 molecules from erythrocytes of\nOld World and New World monkeys by \ufb02uorescence cytometry. Erythrocytes\nfrom monkeys were incubated with either preimmune antiserum, SCR1-speci\ufb01c\nantiserum, or polyclonal antiserum directed against human CD46. The erythro-\ncytes were subsequently washed twice with FACS buffer by low-speed centrifu-\ngation. Following resuspension of the pellet, the cells were incubated with FITC-\nlabeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and again washed twice with FACS buffer by low-\nspeed centrifugation. The labeled erythrocyte pellet was resuspended in FACS\nbuffer and analyzed with a Becton Dickinson analyzer equipped with a 15-mW\nargon laser at 488 nm.

However, substitution\nof residues in the hinge region between the SCR1 and SCR2\ndomains (Y95 to T98) had little inhibitory effect. These\nchanges seem to indicate that major distortions of the SCR1\nand SCR2 domains camot be tolerated in binding assays.\nAgain, the multiple substitutions did not affect display of the\nmutant CD46 molecules on the surface of the mouse OST-7\ncells (Table 2). It is quite possible that multiple alanine\nmutations might disrupt intramolecular disul\ufb01de bond for-\nmation and alter the native conformation of the virus bind-\ning domains.\nMonoclonal antibodies E4.3 and M75 inhibit binding of H\nprotein by interacting with speci\ufb01c regions in SCR1 and\nSCR2. Two monoclonal antibodies which react with CD46\nwere previously reported to block measles virus infections and\nprevent attachment of the measles virus H protein to the target\ncell (15, 30). We were able to map the regions on CD46 which\ninteract with monoclonal antibodies E4.3 and M75 by using\nrecombinant vaccinia virus expressing different CD46 mutants\n(Table 2) and to show that they inhibited binding of Sf9-H cells\n(Fig. 4). E4.3 inhibited binding of normal CD46 to Sf9-H cells\nby 45%, while M75 yielded 67% inhibition. In order to map the\nmonoclonal antibody epitopes, OST-7 cells were infected with\nvaccinia virus recombinants, and infected cell lysates were an-\nalyzed by immunoblotting with the two monoclonal antibodies;\ndiminished reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies with mu-\ntant CD46 molecules was noted (Table 2). E4.3 antibodies\nappeared to recognize residues 36 to 59 in the amino-terminal\ndomain of SCR1, while M75 recognized amino acids 103 to\n114. These epitopes coincided with the regions where site-\nspeci\ufb01c mutations had the most effect on virus binding. It will\nbe interesting to note the inhibitory effects of additional mono-\nclonal antibodies which recognize other regions of SCR1 and\nSCR2, when they become available.\nDISCUSSION\nCD46 was previously shown to be the receptor for the Ed-\nmonston strain of measles virus (15, 50). This paper expands\nupon the results from two other laboratories (30, 47), which\nclaimed that the presence of both the SCR1 and SCR2 do-\nmains of CD46 is suf\ufb01cient for virus binding. We proved that\nthis process occurs via direct interaction of the H protein with\nSCR1 and SCR2 by using a convenient binding assay with Sf9\ninsect cells expressing the viral surface protein, H. In our study\nwe were surprised to note that all New World monkeys which\nwere analyzed did not express the SCR1 domain in CD46\nmolecules present on their erythrocytes and lymphocytes. This\nobservation accounted for their inability to bind measles virus\nand hemagglutinate. The SCR1 deletion corresponds to a\nmissing second exon which is not retained in the CD46 mRNA\nduring the processing of precursor RNA; however, the exon\nstill appears to be present in chromosomal DNA (29), which\nimplies some irregularity in the splicing process. The compo-\nsitions of the STP and cytoplasmic domains of CD46 are\nknown to vary through a process of alternate splicing, but\nexons corresponding to the SCR domains have never been\nreported to be deleted through mRNA processing (62, 63, 71).\nNo functional role has yet been assigned to the SCR1 domain\nFIG. 3. Binding assay for mutant CD46 molecules by using insect cells expressing the H protein of measles virus. Mouse OST-7 cells were infected with wild-type\nvaccinia virus (A), vaccinia virus expressing the SCR1 domain, the STP region, and the CD46 transmembrane region (B), a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SCR1,\nSCR2, the STP domain, and the CD46 transmembrane domain (C), or a recombinant virus expressing the entire human CD46 molecule (D). OST-7 cells alone normally\ndo not bind measles virus. Sf9 insect cells infected with a baculovirus expressing measles H protein and b-galactosidase were incubated with Bluogal substrate, washed\nwith PBS, and added to the vaccinia virus-infected cells. Binding of blue-colored insect cells to mouse cells which expressed either SCR1 and SCR2 (C) or the entire\nhuman CD46 molecule (D) was apparent.\n6150\nHSU ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nof this molecule, since complement components C3b and C4b\nhave previously been demonstrated to interact with SCR2,\nSCR3, and SCR4 (1, 12, 30). A role in signal transduction has\nrecently been proposed for CD46, and it was shown that in-\nteraction of this receptor with measles virus or monoclonal\nantibodies speci\ufb01c for SCR1 could downregulate the produc-\ntion of interleukin-12 (32). This receptor interaction could\npartially account for the immunosuppressive effects of measles\nvirus. It remains to be determined if other cellular factors\nbesides measles virus interact with the SCR1 domain. The\ndeletion of SCR1 in most tissues of New World monkeys (29)\nmay have interesting evolutionary implications in terms of dis-\nease and immune regulation.\nErythrocytes from the baboon Papio cynocephalus have pre-\nviously been reported to hemagglutinate in the presence of\nlaboratory strains of measles virus (57, 59). However, research-\ners showed that many Old World monkey erythrocytes, includ-\ning those from Papio cynocephalus, M. fascicularis, M. mulatta,\nand E. patas, were less ef\ufb01cient in these assays than erythro-\ncytes from the African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops)\n(18\u201320). We con\ufb01rmed this result with two other species of\nbaboon (Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas) and found that\nthis decreased ability to hemagglutinate corresponded to a\nchange at amino acid residue 103, which implicates this region\nof CD46 in measles virus binding. We were able to imitate this\nnatural change through site-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis, and our ex-\nperiments revealed decreased af\ufb01nity for the mutant CD46 in\nan Sf9-H binding assay. The nearby carbohydrate attachment\nsite at Asn114 was also shown to be important for optimal\nbinding, since mutation of this residue to Ala also reduced\ninteraction with Sf9-H cells. In addition, the epitope for a\nmonoclonal antibody, M75, was mapped to the same region\n(amino acids 103 to 118) by using immunoblot analysis of our\nmutant CD46 molecules, and it was also shown to inhibit bind-\ning effectively. These preceding studies appear to implicate the\nregion of CD46 consisting of amino acids 103 to 118 as at least\none of the sites involved in virus attachment.\nThe arti\ufb01cial mutation in CD46 which changed GluArg at\npositions 58 and 59 to AlaAla had a dramatic effect on Sf9-H\ncell binding. This is a region which could be involved in elec-\ntrostatic interaction with the binding region of measles virus H\nprotein. Arginine at concentrations of 1 M has previously been\nshown to abrogate virus binding and hemagglutination (37).\nThe region at amino acid 58 or 59 could contribute to salt-\ndependent or charged residue interaction during the attach-\nment process (23, 37, 76). The monoclonal antibody E4.3 has\npreviously been studied in virus attachment experiments (30,\n47). There is some discrepancy between the results from the\ntwo laboratories as to the effectiveness of this antibody in\ninhibiting the binding of H protein to target cells, which could\nbe related to the concentration of the reagent used in their\nexperiments. Our results support those of Manchester et al.\n(47) and con\ufb01rm that E4.3 was indeed a potent inhibitor of\nmeasles virus H protein attachment. We further demonstrated\nthat the epitope for monoclonal antibody E4.3 mapped to a\nregion of CD46 between amino acids 37 and 59 by using im-\nmunoblot analysis of our mutant CD46 molecules. Taken to-\ngether, these data indicate that the region of CD46 consisting\nof amino acids 37 to 59 also participates in binding to the\nmeasles virus H protein.\nThe CD4 binding region (amino acids 39 to 59) which in-\nteracts with human immunode\ufb01ciency virus glycoprotein\n(gp120) has previously been mapped by other investigators\nthrough a series of site-speci\ufb01c mutations and interactions with\nmonoclonal antibodies (5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 31, 48, 60, 72, 79).\nSynthetic peptides were also employed by other laboratories in\nattempts to map binding regions on CD4 but led to contradic-\ntory results (31, 38, 39, 64, 83). Originally we also attempted to\nperform peptide studies with measles virus and CD46 by using\n25-amino-acid peptides derived from all regions of SCR1 and\nSCR2. Peptides at concentrations as high as 200 mM had no\neffect in Sf9-H binding and measles virus infectivity assays. We\npresumed that binding of measles virus depended on confor-\nmational epitopes rather than linear peptide epitopes. Subse-\nquently, a genetic approach using site-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis was\nadopted in our laboratory to map binding regions on CD46.\nInitially we found that large mutagenic changes involving mul-\nTABLE 2.

These mul-\ntiple mutations appeared to perturb binding of Sf9-H cells to\nCD46, no matter which region was targeted. Surface expres-\nsion of the mutated CD46 molecule was not affected, but\nintramolecular disul\ufb01de bond formation may have been al-\ntered. The only area where multiple alanine mutations did not\ndramatically affect binding was the hinge region between SCR1\nand SCR2, indicating that this region was relatively refractile\nto mutagenesis and probably was not important in measles\nvirus binding. Smaller point mutations were subsequently uti-\nlized in our experiments to map regions in SCR1 and SCR2\nwhich are important for measles virus binding.\nA molecular understanding of the exact interaction of mea-\nsles virus H protein with CD46 will ultimately depend upon\nstructural studies using nuclear magnetic resonance or X-ray\ncrystallography to dissect the binding regions of H, SCR1, and\nSCR2. Serum factor H, like CD46, is another complement\nbinding protein which is composed of 20 short consensus re-\ngions. The SCR15 and SCR16 regions of factor H, whose\nthree-dimensional structure has been solved (7), has some\nhomology to the two terminal domains of CD46. The polypep-\ntide backbone for CD46-SCR1 and CD46-SCR2 can be\ncrudely modeled and superimposed on that for the SCR15 and\nSCR16 domains from factor H. However, one can only approx-\nimate regions of interaction between the receptor and viral\nglycoprotein at this time. The \ufb01ne structure of the intramolec-\nular loops de\ufb01ned by the cysteine residues and the orientation\nof the SCR domains about the hinge region between SCR1 and\nSCR2 will likely determine the residues available in the bind-\ning site. Mutagenesis offers some clues as to which residues are\nimportant in virus binding, but these experiments are actually\na lead into structural studies.\nBased on the deletion of SCR1 regions in New World mon-\nkeys, we might predict that marmosets and tamarins from\nSouth America are resistant to infections by the Edmonston\nstrain of measles virus. Studies in our laboratory indicate that\nowl monkey kidney cells (OMK) and marmoset kidney cells\n(NZP-60) also contain this deletion and camot be infected\nwith measles virus in the laboratory (29). However, we and\nothers (33) have infected a marmoset B-cell line which has\nbeen immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus (B95-8), and results\nindicate that these cells contain both the SCR1-deleted and\nnondeleted forms of CD46 (29).

Binding was quantitated by\na colorimetric assay for b-galactosidase with ONPG as a substrate and was compared to a standard value produced by cells expressing the normal CD46 molecule. This\nbinding relative to that for normal human CD46 is represented on the y axis of the histogram, while the various mutations are listed on the x axis. OST-7 cells infected\nwith wild-type vaccinia virus served as a negative control and exhibited no binding to Sf9-H cells. (A) Mutations introduced in SCR1; (B) mutations placed in SCR2;\n(C) multiple alanine substitutions in both SCR1 and SCR2. The inhibitory effects of monoclonal antibodies directed against SCR1 (E4.3) and SCR2 (M75) are also\nshown in panel C. These two commercial antibodies were diluted 1:20 and added to binding assays, and inhibition was noted. Results are expressed as means and\nstandard deviations.\n6152\nHSU ET AL.\nJ.

The disease\nin moustached marmosets has been reported to be character-\nized by severe gastroenterocolitis and immunosuppression (2),\nwhile the symptoms presented by squirrel monkeys are similar\nto those in humans and consist of a rash, Koplik\u2019s spots, and\ninfection of lymphatic tissue (34). The receptor distribution in\nthese animals is currently under study in our laboratory, and\nthe nature of the SCR1 deletion in different organs of monkeys\nmay determine the tissue tropism and nature of the disease in\nthese animals. Since the SCR1 measles virus binding domain\nappears to be missing in these infected New World monkeys, it\nwill be interesting to determine if another receptor besides\nCD46 can be used by measles virus during the process of\nattachment.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the Amgen DNA sequencing facility and Laarni Antonio\nat Thousand Oaks, Calif., for sequencing the different primate CD46\nclones and mutants.

This\nreceptor consists of four short consensus regions (SCR1 to SCR4) which normally function in complement\nregulation. Measles virus has recently been shown to interact with SCR1 and SCR2. In this study, receptors\non different types of monkey erythrocytes were employed as \u201cnatural mutant proteins\u201d to further de\ufb01ne the\nvirus binding regions of CD46. Erythrocytes from African green monkeys and rhesus macaques hemagglutinate\nin the presence of measles virus, while baboon erythrocytes were the least ef\ufb01cient of the Old World monkey\ncells used in these assays. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the SCR2 domain of baboon CD46 contained\nan Arg-to-Gln mutation at amino acid position 103 which accounted for reduced hemagglutination activity.\nSurprisingly, none of the New World monkey erythrocytes hemagglutinated in the presence of virus. Sequenc-\ning of cDNAs derived from the lymphocytes of these New World monkeys and analysis of their erythrocytes with\nSCR1-speci\ufb01c polyclonal antibodies indicated that the SCR1 domain was deleted in these cells. Additional\nexperiments, which used 35 different site-speci\ufb01c mutations inserted into CD46, were performed to complement\nthe preceding studies. The effects of these arti\ufb01cial mutations were documented with a convenient binding\nassay using insect cells expressing the measles virus hemagglutinin. Mutations which mimicked the change\nfound in baboon CD46 or another which deleted the SCR2 glycosylation site reduced binding substantially.\nAnother mutation which altered GluArg to AlaAla at positions 58 and 59, totally abolished binding. Finally, the\nepitopes for two monoclonal antibodies which inhibit measles virus attachment were mapped to the same\nregions implicated by mutagenesis.\nCD46, also known as membrane cofactor protein, was re-\ncently shown to be a primate-speci\ufb01c receptor for the labora-\ntory-adapted Edmonston strain of measles virus (15, 16, 22,\n50). This surface glycoprotein is expressed on most types of\ncells and normally functions as a regulator of complement\nactivity and helps to protect self tissue from autoimmune de-\nstruction (40, 41). CD46 is composed of four extracellular\nshort consensus domains (SCR1, SCR2, SCR3, and SCR4)\nfollowed by a region rich in serine, threonine, and proline\n(called STP), a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic\ndomain at its carboxyl terminus. Variations in splicing of exons\nencoding STP cassettes and cytoplasmic regions yield glyco-\nproteins which vary in size from 57 to 67 kDa and consist of all\nfour SCR domains, a combination of STP regions, and one of\ntwo different possible carboxy termini (62, 63, 71). Each of the\nknown splicing variants of human CD46 is capable of binding\nmeasles virus (21, 46).\nThe CD46 binding domains for the laboratory-adapted Ed-\nmonston strain of measles virus have recently been mapped to\nSCR1 and SCR2 (47) by using chimeric recombinant mole-\ncules composed of parts of CD46 and a related molecule called\nCD55, or decay-accelerating factor. Another group has done\nsimilar experiments with chimeras of CD46 and CD4 (11),\nwhile others expressed CD46 deletion mutants in Chinese\nhamster ovary cells (30) and con\ufb01rmed the role of SCR1 and\nSCR2 in virus binding. Monoclonal antibodies speci\ufb01c for\nSCR1 and SCR2 also block measles virus binding to the host\ncell (30, 47). The role of carbohydrate linked to the asparagine\nresidue in the SCR1 domain of CD46 appears to be minimal,\nwhile carbohydrate associated with asparagine in SCR2 ap-\npears to be critical for binding measles virus (42, 43).\nMeasles virus (25, 78) is a paramyxovirus which consists of a\nnegative-strand RNA genome and an envelope which contains\ntwo surface glycoproteins known as hemagglutinin protein (H)\nand membrane fusion protein (F). A nonglycosylated mem-\nbrane protein (M) lies on the inner side of the envelope and\nmediates an association of the glycoproteins with the nucleo-\ncapsid of the virus. H protein is responsible for virus attach-\nment and interacts with CD46 (4, 14, 42), while F mediates\npenetration and syncytium formation (45, 65, 67, 70, 82). In-\nteraction of H with its receptor has been shown to downregu-\nlate surface CD46 in cultured cells (28, 35, 49, 73\u201375), and four\namino acids on the virus attachment protein have recently\nbeen implicated in this interaction (8). In addition, virus grown\nin cultured cells binds to the receptors on many, but not all,\nspecies of monkey erythrocytes to yield hemagglutination (20,\n53\u201355, 57\u201359, 69). Hemagglutination assays with erythrocytes\nfrom cercopithecus and rhesus monkeys have traditionally\nbeen used to determine titers of laboratory strains of measles\n* Corresponding author.

However, the\nerythrocytes of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas do not hem-\nagglutinate in the presence of measles virus, which correlates\nwith the absence of CD46 on the surfaces of erythrocytes from\nthese higher primates (19, 52).\nSince a number of species of monkey erythrocytes vary in\ntheir ability to bind measles virus and subsequently hemagglu-\ntinate (18\u201320), we proposed to use the receptors on these\nerythrocytes as \u201cnatural mutant proteins\u201d in an attempt to\nfurther de\ufb01ne the binding regions of CD46. In this work, we\n\ufb01rst studied the ability of New World and Old World monkey\nerythrocytes to hemagglutinate in the presence of measles vi-\nrus. Surprisingly, none of the New World monkey erythrocytes\nhemagglutinated in the presence of measles virus, although it\nwas evident that they expressed CD46 on their cell surfaces.\nThe CD46 molecules from the lymphocytes and erythrocytes of\nNew World monkeys all lacked the SCR1 coding region adja-\ncent to the amino-terminal signal peptide. A speci\ufb01c mutation\npresent within the CD46 molecules of baboons which could\naccount for diminished hemagglutination activity in the pres-\nence of measles virus was noted. In addition, the effects of\ncertain arti\ufb01cial mutations introduced into CD46 by site-spe-\nci\ufb01c mutagenesis are reported.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell lines and virus. HeLa, Vero, and HuTK-143B cells were purchased from\nthe American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.). Sf9 insect cells were\nsupplied by Invitrogen (San Diego, Calif.) and were grown in Grace\u2019s medium.\nHeLa, Vero, and HuTK-143B cells were propagated in Dulbecco\u2019s minimum\nessential medium (GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.) supplemented with 10%\nfetal calf serum. In addition, HuTK-143B cells were cultivated in the presence of\n12.5 mg of bromodeoxyuridine per ml. Monkey (cercopithecus, cynomologus, and\nrhesus) erythrocytes were purchased from Connaught Laboratories (Toronto,\nCanada), and baboon erythrocytes came from Lampire Biological Laboratories\n(Pipersville, Pa.). Other monkey erythrocytes were obtained from the Granby\nZoo (Granby, Canada), the Montreal Biodome (Montreal, Canada), the Quebec\nCity Zoo (Quebec City, Canada), the Toronto Metropolitan Zoo (Toronto,\nCanada), the National Institutes of Health primate center (Poolesville, Md.),\nMerck-Frosst Pharmaceuticals (Montreal, Canada), and the New England Pri-\nmate Center (Boston, Mass.). The Edmonston strain of measles virus was orig-\ninally obtained from Erling Norrby (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden)\nand was propagated in Vero monkey kidney cells as previously described (24).\nCD46 polypeptide expression and production of antibodies. Polyclonal anti-\nbodies (CD46-333) directed against entire CD46 protein and antiserum directed\nagainst the SCR1 domain of CD46 protein were prepared by immunization of\nrabbits with puri\ufb01ed recombinant protein. The entire CD46-coding region (iso-\ntype C2) was synthesized by PCR with oligonucleotide primers as previously\ndescribed (15). The DNA fragment was cloned into the NheI site of the bacu-\nlovirus expression vector BlueBac2 (pETL), and recombinant baculovirus was\ngenerated (36, 68, 80). Recombinant CD46 protein was expressed in Sf9 insect\ncells, resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, electro-\neluted, and injected into rabbits to generate a polyclonal antibody by routine\nmethods (66, 81). A DNA fragment containing SCR1 was synthesized by PCR\nwith\noligonucleotide\nprimers\ncorresponding\nto\nthe\n59\nend\n(59-AACGGATCCT-GTGAGGAGCCACCAACA-39)\nand\nthe\n39\nend\n(59-TGGTGTTCGAAAATTGTCCGCAGTAGA-CTCTG-39) of the SCR1-\ncoding sequence. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and\nthen cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pT7-7His cut with the same\nenzymes (77). The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli\nBL21(DE3) by electroporation, and the recombinant protein was expressed by\ninduction with 0.4 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The SCR1\npolypeptide fused to His6 was puri\ufb01ed by metal chelation chromotography with\nNi-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions (61). Pu-\nri\ufb01ed SCR1 polypeptide was injected into rabbits for the production of poly-\nclonal antibodies (27). In addition, the monoclonal antibody E4.3 (speci\ufb01c for\nSCR1) was purchased from Bio/Can Scienti\ufb01c (Mississauga, Canada), and mono-\nclonal antibody M75 (speci\ufb01c for SCR2) came from Seikugaku Inc. (Tokyo,\nJapan).\nHemagglutination of different primate erythrocytes by measles virus. Primate\nblood samples were collected from animals in Vacutainer tubes containing hep-\narin-EDTA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) and stored in Alsevier\u2019s\nsolution (GIBCO-BRL) for no more than 2 days. Cells were washed two times\nwith phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and a 1% (vol/vol) solution was used in\nthe hemagglutination assays. A standard sample of concentrated measles virus\n(107 PFU/ml) was diluted serially (1:1) with PBS, and 50 ml of each dilution was\nadded to individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate with round-bottom cham-\nbers (Costar, Cambridge, Mass.). A 50-ml sample of the erythrocytes was added\nto each well. Hemagglutination was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Erythro-\ncytes settled to the bottom of the chambers when the assay was negative but\nformed a suspended matrix when the assay was positive. The assay titer was the\nhighest dilution of virus which produced hemagglutination.\nIsolation of monkey lymphocytes and synthesis of cDNAs from CD46 mRNA.\nLymphocytes from different monkey species were prepared by using a Ficoll-\nPaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) discontinuous gradient. Fresh monkey\nblood (2 to 3 ml) was diluted with an equal volume of balanced salt solution\n(0.01% anhydrous D-glucose, 5 mM CaCl2, 98 mM MgCl2, 0.545 mM KCl, 0.126\nM NaCl, and 14.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and layered onto 3 ml of Ficoll-Paque.\nThe sample was centrifuged at 700 3 g for 30 min at 20\u00b0C. The lymphocyte layer\nat the balanced salt solution\u2013Ficoll-Paque interface was collected and diluted\nwith 3 volumes of balanced salt solution. Following centrifugation at 700 3 g for\n10 min at 20\u00b0C, the lymphocyte pellet was washed once with 1 ml of balanced salt\nsolution and then resuspended in 1 ml of TRIzol (GIBCO-BRL). Chloroform\n(0.2 ml) was added, and the TRIzol lysate was vortexed and left for 3 min at room\ntemperature. The denatured extract was centrifuged at 10,000 3 g for 10 min at\n4\u00b0C. RNA in the upper aqueous layer was then precipitated with 0.5 ml of\nisopropanol at room temperature for 10 min and then concentrated by centrif-\nugation at 10,000 3 g for 10 min. Finally, the pellet was washed once with 75%\nethanol, dried in the air, and resuspended in 50 ml of H2O. Synthesis of cDNA\nwas performed from mRNA by using the First Strand Synthesis kit (Pharmacia)\nand a speci\ufb01c CD46 primer (59-GGGACAACACAAATTACTGC-39). Double-\nstranded DNA fragments were generated by nested PCRs. Primers derived from\nthe\nhuman\nCD46\nsequence\ncorresponding\nto\n59-GCAACTCCAACAACTATGGC-39\nand\n59-AGTGTCCCTTTCCTTCCTG-39 were used for the \ufb01rst 30 rounds of PCR\nampli\ufb01cation.\nInterior,\nor\nnested,\nprimers\ncorresponding\nto\n59-ACAATCACAGCAATGACCCA-39\nand\n59-CGCTTTCCTGGGTTGCTTC-39 of human CD46 were used for the follow-\ning 30 rounds of PCR.\nDetermination of the 5*-terminal sequences of CD46 mRNA. The 59-terminal\ncoding regions of different monkey CD46 molecules were determined by using\nthe Marathon cDNA Ampli\ufb01cation Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) as described\nin the reference manual. Poly(A)1 RNA was \ufb01rst isolated from total RNA by\nusing a QuickPrep mRNA puri\ufb01cation kit (Pharmacia). Reverse transcriptase\n(RT) and an oligo(dT) primer were used to synthesize the \ufb01rst-strand cDNA\nfrom 1 mg of poly(A)1 RNA. The second-strand DNA was synthesized by using\na mixture of RNase H, DNA polymerase I, DNA ligase, and then T4 DNA\npolymerase (26). The Marathon cDNA adapter was ligated to the double-\nstranded DNA after synthesis of second-strand cDNA. Monkey CD46 fragment\ncontaining the 59 coding region was generated by nested PCR with a human\nCD46-speci\ufb01c primer (59-TAAGACACTTTGGAACTGGG-39) and the Mara-\nthon\ncDNA\nadapter-speci\ufb01c\nprimer\nAP1\n(59-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-39) for the \ufb01rst 30 rounds of\nPCR and with a human CD46-speci\ufb01c nested primer (59--39) and the Marathon\ncDNA\nadapter-speci\ufb01c\nnested\nprimer\nAP2\n(59-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-39) for the next 30 rounds of PCR\nampli\ufb01cation. CD46 DNA fragments from the different monkeys were rendered\nblunt with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, Calif.) and then cloned into\nthe SrfI site of the PCR Script Amp (SK1) vector (Stratagene).\nSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. SDS-poly-\nacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblot analysis were per-\nformed as previously described (81). The E4.3 and M75 monoclonal antibodies\n(1:500 dilution) were incubated with nitrocellulose paper blotted with total\nproteins from OST-7 cells infected with mutant CD46 recombinant virus. Bind-\ning of monoclonal antibodies was detected by ECL chemiluminescence (Amer-\nsham, Arlington Heights, Ill.).\nDNA sequencing. DNA fragments contained in PCR-Script AmP (SK(1)\nvectors were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems 430I automated sequencer\nlocated at the Amgen DNA sequencing facility (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif.).\nSequence analysis and alignments were performed with Lasergene software\n(DNASTAR, Madison, Wis.).\nFlow cytometry analysis of monkey erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Monkey\nblood (50 ml) was centrifuged at 1,500 3 g for 5 min, washed twice with 5 ml of\n\ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine\nserum albumin, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% sodium azide). The erythrocytes were\nresuspended in 100 ml of the same buffer containing a 1:100 dilution of either\npreimmune antibody, CD46-333 antibody, or SCR1 antibody for 1 h on ice.\nFollowing the incubation, cells were washed twice with 3 ml of FACS buffer by\ncentrifugation at 1,500 3 g for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in 100 ml of the\nsame buffer containing a 1:100 dilution of \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-\nlabeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (heavy plus light chains) for 1 h on\nice. After being washed twice with 3 ml of FACS buffer, the blood cells were\nsuspended in 0.5 ml of FACS buffer and were subsequently analyzed on a Becton\nDickinson analyzer equipped with a 15-mW argon laser at 488 nm. The data were\ncollected and analyzed with CellQuest software.\nMonkey lymphocytes were also analyzed by \ufb02ow cytometry. The monkey blood\nsamples were prepared and labeled as described above. Following the incubation\nVOL. 71, 1997\nCD46 REGIONS IMPORTANT FOR MEASLES VIRUS BINDING\n6145\n\nwith FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, the cells were washed and resuspended in 100\nml of FACS buffer. Erythrocytes were lysed by treatment of each sample with 1\nml of FACS lysis buffer (Becton Dickinson) for 1 min. The lymphocytes were\nwashed twice with 3 ml of FACS buffer, and monkey lymphocyte \ufb02uorescence\ndata were collected as described in the previous paragraph. Mouse OST7 cells\n(2 3 106 cells) which expressed mutant forms of CD46 were suspended in 1 ml\nof Cell Dissociation Buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and washed two times by\ncentrifugation with FACS buffer. The \ufb01nal pellet was suspended in 100 ml of\nFACS buffer prior to analysis by \ufb02uorescence cytometry.\nSite-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis of CD46 and expression of mutants by using vac-\ncinia virus recombinants. Portions of SCR1 and SCR2 domains were replaced\nwith point mutations or four to six alanine residues by using gel-puri\ufb01ed oligo-\nnucleotides consisting of 30 to 40 nucleotides. Mutations were introduced into\nthe CD46 molecule by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from\nStratagene. The CD46-coding region (isotype C2) was cloned into PCR-Script\nAmp SK(1) plasmid, denatured, and annealed with two complementary oligo-\nnucleotides containing the desired mutation; the mutagenized DNA strands were\nextended with Pfu polymerase; the methylated nonmutated parental DNA tem-\nplate was digested with DpnI; and the mutated plasmid was used to transform\nXL2-Blue ultracompetent cells. Mutant plasmids were isolated, and the CD46\ninserts were completely sequenced. The mutagenized CD46-coding regions were\nexcised from the PCR-Script plasmid following digestion with BspHI (59 end)\nand BglII (39 end) and ligated into the vaccinia virus vector pTM1 (containing the\nT7 promoter) which had been digested with the compatible restriction enzymes\nNcoI and BamHI. Vaccinia virus recombinants were prepared and titers were\ndetermined by plaque assays as previously described, using HuTK-143B cells and\nbromodeoxyuridine selection (17). CD46 mutants were expressed in mouse\nOST-7 cells which contained the T7 polymerase, and protein synthesis and\nsurface expression were monitored by Western immunoblot and FACS scan\nanalysis.\nDirect binding assays between CD46 mutants and insect cells expressing\nmeasles virus H protein. Mutant CD46-coding sequences were cloned into the\npTM1 vaccinia virus expression vector, which uses the T7 promoter to direct\ntranscription of the foreign gene. Recombinant vaccinia virus was prepared as\npreviously described (17), and mutant CD46 molecules were expressed in mouse\nOST7 cells which contain the T7 polymerase. Sf9 insect cells were infected for\n48 h with a recombinant baculovirus (81) which had been generated with the\nBlueBac2 expression vector (Invitrogen) (36, 68) and synthesized both the mea-\nsles virus H protein and b-galactosidase. The insect cells were colored blue by\nadding Bluogal (GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, N.Y.), at 36 h of infection, from a\nstock solution (50 mg/ml in dimethylformamide) to give a 0.05% (wt/vol) \ufb01nal\nconcentration. Infections with recombinant vaccinia virus were allowed to pro-\nceed for 12 h; Sf9 insect cells expressing the measles H protein and b-galacto-\nsidase were incubated for 1/2 h with the vaccinia virus-infected mouse OST7 cells\nin the presence of PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum. Nonadsorbed insect cells\nwere eluted by washing the mouse cells two times with PBS. Binding in 25-cm2\ntissue culture \ufb02asks could be quantitated visually under a microscope or quan-\ntitatively by the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenylgalactoside (ONPG) with a b-galac-\ntosidase assay kit (Stratagene). Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of 100 mM sodium\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% Nonidet P-40.\nAliquots of lysate (50 ml) were added to a 96-well microtitration plate, and\nfreshly prepared buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4,\n50 mM b-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) was mixed with each aliquot to give a \ufb01nal\nvolume of 160 ml. A 50-ml volume of ONPG solution (4 mg/ml in 100 mM sodium\nphosphate, pH 7.5) was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C until a yellow\ncolor was evident, after about 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition\nof 90 ml of 1 M Na2CO3, and the color intensity was measured at 420 nm with a\nSpectraMax 250 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader purchased\nfrom Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, Calif.). Results were linear over time for an\nabsorbance range of 0.1 to 1 A420 unit.\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The nucleotide sequences coding for\nthe extracellular domains of monkey CD46 molecules were submitted to Gen-\nBank and have the following accession numbers: Aotus trivirgatus, U87914; Papio\nhamadryas, U87915; Callimico goeldii, U87916; Callithrix jacchus, U87917; Sagui-\nnus mystax, U87918; Saimiri sciureus, U87919; Cercopithecus aethiops, U87920;\nMacaca fascicularis, U87921; Macaca mulatta, U87922; and Pithecia pithecia,\nU87923.\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of CD46 surface expression and hemagglutination\nof primate erythrocytes in the presence of Edmonston measles\nvirus. Certain monkey erythrocytes are known to bind measles\nvirus and have been routinely used to determine titers of mea-\nsles virus in hemagglutination assays (19, 56). However, it is\nknown that human and chimpanzee erythrocytes do not hem-\nagglutinate in the presence of measles virus (19, 54). This can\nnow be attributed to the fact that the erythrocytes of humans,\ngorillas, and chimpanzees do not have CD46, the receptor for\nmeasles virus, on their cell surfaces (52). African green mon-\nkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) erythrocytes are known to be most\nsensitive to measles virus-induced agglutination (18, 20, 69).\nWe collected erythrocytes from a number of Old World and\nNew World monkeys and assayed their ability to hemaggluti-\nnate in the presence of Edmonston measles virus which had\nbeen propagated in Vero monkey kidney cells (Table 1). The\npresence of CD46 on the surfaces of these monkey erythro-\ncytes was \ufb01rst veri\ufb01ed by \ufb02uorescence analysis with a poly-\nclonal antibody speci\ufb01c for human CD46. All primate eryth-\nrocytes which were tested, with the exception of human and\nchimpanzee erythrocytes, bound the CD46 antibody. Levels of\nimmune recognition were probably less in Lemur macaco due\nto species-speci\ufb01c variation of its CD46 protein. Hemaggluti-\nnation assays mediated by measles virus were performed, and\nit was obvious that erythrocytes from South American marmo-\nsets and tamarins (Callimico goeldii, Callithrix jacchus, Pithecia\npithecia, Saimiri sciureus, and Leontopithecus rosalia) and\nMadagascar lemur failed to bind measles virus (Table 1). Old\nWorld monkey erythrocytes varied in their ability to hemag-\nglutinate in the presence of the virus. As expected, human and\nchimpanzee erythrocytes did not hemagglutinate, while Cerco-\npithecus aethiops, Cercopithecus diana, M. fascicularis, M. mu-\nlatta, Erythrocebus patas, and Cercocebus torquatus lunulatus\nyielded high hemagglutination titers. Cercopithecus monkeys\nconsistently yielded slightly higher hemagglutination titers\nthan the rest of the monkeys, as previously reported (18, 20).\nOn the other hand, erythrocytes from baboons (Papio anubis\nand Papio hamadryas) always produced much lower titers in\nTABLE 1.

The larger dilution indicated an increased ability of the erythrocytes to\nhemagglutinate in the presence of measles virus; less virus was required to\ncross-link erythrocytes and maintain them in suspension. Assays with Old World\nmonkey erythrocytes were performed four times and averaged.\n6146\nHSU ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nour assays. We proposed to isolate mRNA from the lympho-\ncytes of these monkeys, synthesize cDNA, and sequence the\nregions coding for the extracellular domains of CD46 in an\nattempt to explain the species-speci\ufb01c variation in hemagglu-\ntination titers exhibited by these different erythrocytes.\nSequence comparisons of CD46 extracellular domains from\ndifferent primates. Lymphocytes were isolated from the blood\nof different monkeys, and cDNAs were prepared by using\nspeci\ufb01c primers and RT, followed by PCR (RT-PCR). The\npredicted amino acid sequence was deduced from at least\nthree separate PCRs for each type of monkey. Subsequently,\nthe signal peptide and short consensus regions (SCR1 to\nSCR4) were aligned by using the Clustal program from Laser-\ngene (Fig. 1). Overall, the CD46 molecules from the different\nprimates were highly conserved, and the protein sequences of\nthe SCR3 and SCR4 regions from all the primates were ex-\ntremely similar. The SCR3 and SCR4 domains of Old World\nmacaques exhibited 93% identity to the human sequence,\nFIG. 1. Amino acid sequence alignment of signal peptides and short consensus regions from CD46 molecules found in lymphocytes of Old World and New World\nmonkeys. Blood samples were obtained from a variety of primates originating from either Africa or South America. Lymphocytes were isolated by gradient\ncentrifugation, total RNA was extracted, and cDNA was prepared with RT by using speci\ufb01c oligonucleotide primers from the conserved STP and transmembrane\ndomains. DNA sequences were ampli\ufb01ed by using conserved oligonucleotides upstream of the signal peptide region and regions adjacent to the SCR4 regions. The\n59 ends of New World monkeys were also cloned by rapid ampli\ufb01cation of cDNA ends with a conserved primer from the SCR3 region. At least three independent cDNA\nclones were sequenced, translated to yield a predicted protein, and aligned by using the Clustal method in the Lasergene DNA analysis package. Residues which differ\nfrom the human consensus are shaded. Old World primates include humans (Homo sapiens), cynomolgus monkeys (M. fascicularis), rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta),\nbaboons (Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas), and African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops). New World primates which we tested were the common marmoset\n(Callithrix jacchus), Goeldii\u2019s marmoset (Callimico goeldii), the moustached marmoset (Saguinus mystax), the white-faced saki (Pithecia pithecia), the owl monkey (A.\ntrivirgatus), and the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). The signal peptide and SCR1, SCR2, and SCR3 regions are indicated by solid lines beneath the sequences. The\nSCR4 domain is not shown, since it was very similar for all monkeys tested. The mutation found in baboon CD46 at amino acid 103 is highlighted by a solid box.\nVOL. 71, 1997\nCD46 REGIONS IMPORTANT FOR MEASLES VIRUS BINDING\n6147\n\nwhile those of New World monkeys were 80% identical. This\nconservation seems consistent with the role of these regions of\nCD46 in complement regulation (40, 41). Since the SCR4\nsequence is very similar for all monkeys, it is not shown in Fig.\n1. The conserved amino-terminal signal peptides, STP regions,\nand membrane-spanning regions facilitated RT-PCR across\nthe extracellular domain of CD46. It was immediately evident\nthat the coding region for SCR1 (consisting of 63 amino acids)\nwas missing from the cDNAs derived from the mRNAs of New\nWorld monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, Pithecia pithecia, Callimico\ngoeldii, A. trivirgatus, and Saimiri sciureus). The observation\nthat the SCR1-coding region was missing from mRNAs of\nlymphocytes and erythrocyte precursors of New World mon-\nkeys explains why the erythrocytes of New World monkeys did\nnot hemagglutinate in the presence of measles virus, since this\nregion has previously been implicated in measles virus binding\n(30, 47). The SCR2 region varied most from the human se-\nquence for both Old World and New World monkeys. This\nregion was 73% identical to the human SCR2 for Old World\nmonkeys and 68% identical for New World monkeys. Con-\nserved regions of identity might be expected to participate in\nbinding to the measles virus H protein.\nThe CD46 sequences for different classes of Old and New\nWorld monkeys resembled each other and could clearly be\nused to classify the primates into different groups. Baboons,\nmacaques, and African green monkeys belong to the family\nCercopithecidae (51), and all have similar changes at 28 posi-\ntions in the signal peptide and SCR regions when compared to\nthe same extracellular portion of human CD46. Bands of\namino acid identity at over 22 positions could easily differen-\ntiate whether the CD46 sequence belonged to an Old or New\nWorld monkey. South American monkeys could be further\nsubclassi\ufb01ed on the basis of 10 additional variations in the\nsequence shown in Fig. 1. Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus and\nCallimico goeldii) and tamarins (Saguinus mystax, Saguinus oe-\ndipus, and Leontipithecus rosalia) belong to the Callithrichidae\nfamily (51). On the other hand, squirrel monkeys (Saimiri\nsciureus), owl monkeys (A. trivirgatus), and white-faced sakis\n(Pithecia pithecia) are members of the Cebidae family (51).\nThese family af\ufb01liations are re\ufb02ected in amino acid variations\nfound in the external domains of CD46 (Fig. 1).\nCD46 sequences from baboons contained only seven amino\nacid changes when compared to the cercopithecus monkey\nsequence; six of these changes (positions 71, 92, 106, 113, 149,\nand 172) were conservative, but the other change, at position\n103, produced an Arg-to-Gln substitution. This change might\naccount for the reduced hemagglutination properties of ba-\nboon erythrocytes and was considered in subsequent studies.\nCynomolgus (M. fascicularis) and rhesus (M. mulatta) monkey\nCD46 sequences were almost identical to the sequence of\nCercopithecus aethiops, and all changes were minor and con-\nservative. A slightly greater level of CD46 cell surface expres-\nsion on the erythrocytes of Cercopithecus aethiops and Cerco-\npithecus diana could explain the consistent difference in\nhemagglutination between cercopithecus monkeys and ma-\ncaques (Table 1). It should also be noted that the Edmonston\nstrain of measles virus has been routinely propagated in Vero\nand CV-1 cells, which are derived from the kidneys of an\nAfrican green monkey. Propagation of this laboratory strain in\nculture would ultimately favor the binding of measles virus to\nthe Cercophithecus aethiops CD46 receptor over those of other\nmonkeys.\nConserved blocks of amino acids in the SCR1 and SCR2\nregions could give some clues as to which regions are most\nimportant in binding to measles virus. SCR1 regions between\namino acids 37 to 54 and 56 to 91 seem to be almost identical\nin the Old World monkeys. In addition, SCR2 regions consist-\ning of residues 96 to 99, 103 to 109, 113 to 117, 124 to 135, 137\nto 144, and 146 to 162 are almost identical in CD46 molecules\nfrom the Old World monkeys and could contribute to virus\nbinding. Glycosylation sites at Asn83 and Asn114 are abso-\nlutely retained, 6 of 8 cysteine residues are conserved, and the\n13 prolines are maintained at all positions except residues 100,\n104, and 112. It was interesting that baboons, macaques, and\nAfrican green monkeys contained another potential glycosyla-\ntion site in their SCR3 domain at residue 213. However, this\nshould not affect binding to H, since this region of CD46 does\nnot appear to interact with the virus during attachment.\nPolyclonal antibodies con\ufb01rm that the SCR1 region is ab-\nsent from CD46 molecules expressed on the erythrocytes and\nlymphocytes from New World monkeys. SCR1 polypeptides\n(amino acids 30 to 91) derived from CD46 were expressed in E.\ncoli, and recombinant protein was puri\ufb01ed and injected into\nrabbits in order to generate polyclonal antibodies. These anti-\nbodies were used to study surface expression of SCR1 on\nerythrocytes, lymphocytes, and a number of cell lines from Old\nand New World monkeys by \ufb02uorescent-antibody analysis. A\npolyclonal antibody directed against the entire CD46 molecule\nindicated that the erythrocytes from most Old and all New\nWorld monkeys express CD46 on their cell surface (Fig. 2).\nHowever, SCR1-speci\ufb01c antibodies clearly con\ufb01rmed that the\nerythrocytes of Old World monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops,\nM. mulatta, M. fascicularis, and Papio anubis) expressed the\nSCR1 domain of CD46 on their surface (Fig. 2A), while anal-\nysis of New World monkeys (A. trivirgatus, Saimiri sciureus,\nCallithrix jacchus, and Saguinus oedipus) showed that it was\nabsent (Fig. 2B). Analysis of lymphocytes, following lysis of\nerythrocytes, gave identical results (data not shown). This re-\nsult con\ufb01rmed our RT-PCR analysis of mRNA derived from\nlymphocytes and explained why New World monkey erythro-\ncytes did not hemagglutinate in the presence of the laboratory\nstrain of Edmonston measles virus, since the SCR1 domain has\nbeen implicated in measles virus binding (30, 47).\nA convenient binding assay with Sf9 insect cells expressing\nmeasles virus H protein and b-galactosidase can be used to\nstudy the binding domains of CD46. Our laboratory previously\ndemonstrated that Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant\nbaculovirus expressing the measles virus H protein (Sf9-H)\nwere capable of binding to erythrocytes from African green\nmonkeys (80). Since recombinant baculovirus was derived by\nusing the BlueBac2 (pETL) expression vector (36, 68), the\ninsect cells expressed b-galactosidase as well as measles virus\nH protein. We reasoned that these infected Sf9 cells grown in\nsuspension should be capable of binding to mammalian cells\nwith CD46 at their cell surface. Preliminary studies demon-\nstrated that Sf9-H cells could indeed bind to HeLa cells and in\naddition could be stained blue in the presence of Bluogal, a\nsubstrate for b-galactosidase (29). Control Sf9 insect cells in-\nfected with wild-type Autographa californica nuclear polyhe-\ndrosis virus did not adhere to target cells and could be washed\naway. A mouse cell line containing the T7 polymerase gene\n(OST-7) does not normally bind measles virus. When infected\nwith a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing human CD46\nunder control of the T7 promoter, these rodent cells could bind\nthe Sf9-H cells (Fig. 3D). Mouse cells infected with wild-type\nvaccinia virus or a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the\nSCR1, STP, and transmembrane regions of CD46 could not\nbind the Sf9-H cells (Fig. 3A and B). However, mouse OST-7\ncells infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the\nSCR1, SCR2, STP, and transmembrane regions (Fig. 3C)\ncould bind Sf9-H cells just as well as if they were infected with\nvaccinia virus synthesizing the whole CD46 molecule (Fig. 3D).\n6148\nHSU ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nThese results con\ufb01rm previous \ufb01ndings (11, 30, 47) which show\nthat both the SCR1 and SCR2 domains of CD46 are required\nfor measles virus binding. The results presented in Fig. 3 attest\nto the credibility of this assay and establish a simple direct\nbinding assay for interaction between measles virus H protein\nand the human CD46 molecule. Previous investigators moni-\ntored this binding indirectly through the ability of measles virus\nto initiate infection in rodent cells expressing CD46 variants\n(47), \ufb02uorescence microscopy with measles antibodies (47),\n\ufb02uorescence cytometry measurements with H monoclonal an-\ntibody (30, 50), or the ability to form rosettes between African\ngreen monkey erythrocytes and the CD46-bearing target cell\n(15) or semiquantitatively with a biotinylated H protein overlay\nbinding assay with nitrocellulose blots containing CD46 (42).\nOur new binding assay with Sf9-H cells offers the advantages of\nbeing quick, sensitive, and easy to quantitate with either Bluo-\ngal or ONPG substrates.\nSite-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis can be used to map regions of\nCD46 important for interaction of the H protein. Binding of\nmeasles virus to African green monkey erythrocytes has pre-\nviously been reported to be reversed by incubation with 1 M\narginine, and consequently, electrostatic interactions appeared\nto be important in virus attachment (37). With this result in\nmind, we decided to initiate our mutagenesis studies by sys-\ntematically replacing charged amino acids in the SCR1 and\nSCR2 domains with alanine. Larger stretches of the CD46\nbinding domains were also replaced with tracts of four to six\nalanine residues. Mutant CD46 molecules were expressed in\nmouse OST-7 cells by using recombinant vaccinia virus, and\nbinding assays were performed with Sf9-H cells. Expression of\nall CD46 mutants on the surface of OST-7 cells was analyzed\nby \ufb02uorescence cytometry, and similar amounts of recombi-\nnant protein were expressed on all cells. Levels of mutant\nCD46 surface expression are presented in Table 2. Binding of\nSf9-H cells to OST-7 cells expressing mutant CD46 molecules\nwas measured colorimetrically with an ONPG assay, and the\nresults relative to those for normal CD46 are presented in Fig.\n4.\nSubstitution of charged amino acids at the SCR1 amino\nterminus (EE36/37AA and E45A) appeared to moderately\naffect binding and led to 25 to 30% inhibition of binding.\nMutation of the glycosylation site in SCR1 at Asn83 had no\neffect on binding, nor did mutations of the charged residues\nsurrounding this site. However, the mutation ER58/59AA dra-\nmatically inhibited binding, up to 80%. Mutation of RD103/\n104AA and another N-glycosylation site (N114A) in the SCR2\ndomain caused moderate but reproducible inhibition of bind-\ning, 25 and 50%, respectively. As previously stated, the Arg\nresidue at position 103 has been replaced by a Gln in baboons\n(Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas), and we and others have\nnoted that baboon erythrocytes are not nearly as effective in\nhemagglutination assays mediated by measles virus. Changes\nat amino acid 103 appear to diminish measles virus binding but\nnot abolish it. Another laboratory also recently reported that\nthe mutation at Asn114 destroyed this glycosylation site and\nreduced infections and binding by measles virus (44). It has not\nbeen shown whether this carbohydrate chain participates di-\nrectly or indirectly in binding. For the most part, single amino\nacid mutations do not completely abolish binding of mutant\nforms of CD46 to Sf9-H cells. This implies that several distinct\nregions in SCR1 and SCR2 cooperate in binding in a confor-\nmational rather than a linear manner and that no one region of\nSCR1 and SCR2 is critical for virus interaction.\nWe were surprised to observe that multiple substitutions of\nfour to six alanine residues at seven locations over the SCR1\nand SCR2 domains (E42 to G48, K49 to E55, E58 to C64, Y70\nFIG. 2. Analysis of SCR1 domains and CD46 molecules from erythrocytes of\nOld World and New World monkeys by \ufb02uorescence cytometry. Erythrocytes\nfrom monkeys were incubated with either preimmune antiserum, SCR1-speci\ufb01c\nantiserum, or polyclonal antiserum directed against human CD46. The erythro-\ncytes were subsequently washed twice with FACS buffer by low-speed centrifu-\ngation. Following resuspension of the pellet, the cells were incubated with FITC-\nlabeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and again washed twice with FACS buffer by low-\nspeed centrifugation. The labeled erythrocyte pellet was resuspended in FACS\nbuffer and analyzed with a Becton Dickinson analyzer equipped with a 15-mW\nargon laser at 488 nm.

However, substitution\nof residues in the hinge region between the SCR1 and SCR2\ndomains (Y95 to T98) had little inhibitory effect. These\nchanges seem to indicate that major distortions of the SCR1\nand SCR2 domains cannot be tolerated in binding assays.\nAgain, the multiple substitutions did not affect display of the\nmutant CD46 molecules on the surface of the mouse OST-7\ncells (Table 2). It is quite possible that multiple alanine\nmutations might disrupt intramolecular disul\ufb01de bond for-\nmation and alter the native conformation of the virus bind-\ning domains.\nMonoclonal antibodies E4.3 and M75 inhibit binding of H\nprotein by interacting with speci\ufb01c regions in SCR1 and\nSCR2. Two monoclonal antibodies which react with CD46\nwere previously reported to block measles virus infections and\nprevent attachment of the measles virus H protein to the target\ncell (15, 30). We were able to map the regions on CD46 which\ninteract with monoclonal antibodies E4.3 and M75 by using\nrecombinant vaccinia virus expressing different CD46 mutants\n(Table 2) and to show that they inhibited binding of Sf9-H cells\n(Fig. 4). E4.3 inhibited binding of normal CD46 to Sf9-H cells\nby 45%, while M75 yielded 67% inhibition. In order to map the\nmonoclonal antibody epitopes, OST-7 cells were infected with\nvaccinia virus recombinants, and infected cell lysates were an-\nalyzed by immunoblotting with the two monoclonal antibodies;\ndiminished reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies with mu-\ntant CD46 molecules was noted (Table 2). E4.3 antibodies\nappeared to recognize residues 36 to 59 in the amino-terminal\ndomain of SCR1, while M75 recognized amino acids 103 to\n114. These epitopes coincided with the regions where site-\nspeci\ufb01c mutations had the most effect on virus binding. It will\nbe interesting to note the inhibitory effects of additional mono-\nclonal antibodies which recognize other regions of SCR1 and\nSCR2, when they become available.\nDISCUSSION\nCD46 was previously shown to be the receptor for the Ed-\nmonston strain of measles virus (15, 50). This paper expands\nupon the results from two other laboratories (30, 47), which\nclaimed that the presence of both the SCR1 and SCR2 do-\nmains of CD46 is suf\ufb01cient for virus binding. We proved that\nthis process occurs via direct interaction of the H protein with\nSCR1 and SCR2 by using a convenient binding assay with Sf9\ninsect cells expressing the viral surface protein, H. In our study\nwe were surprised to note that all New World monkeys which\nwere analyzed did not express the SCR1 domain in CD46\nmolecules present on their erythrocytes and lymphocytes. This\nobservation accounted for their inability to bind measles virus\nand hemagglutinate. The SCR1 deletion corresponds to a\nmissing second exon which is not retained in the CD46 mRNA\nduring the processing of precursor RNA; however, the exon\nstill appears to be present in chromosomal DNA (29), which\nimplies some irregularity in the splicing process. The compo-\nsitions of the STP and cytoplasmic domains of CD46 are\nknown to vary through a process of alternate splicing, but\nexons corresponding to the SCR domains have never been\nreported to be deleted through mRNA processing (62, 63, 71).\nNo functional role has yet been assigned to the SCR1 domain\nFIG. 3. Binding assay for mutant CD46 molecules by using insect cells expressing the H protein of measles virus. Mouse OST-7 cells were infected with wild-type\nvaccinia virus (A), vaccinia virus expressing the SCR1 domain, the STP region, and the CD46 transmembrane region (B), a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SCR1,\nSCR2, the STP domain, and the CD46 transmembrane domain (C), or a recombinant virus expressing the entire human CD46 molecule (D). OST-7 cells alone normally\ndo not bind measles virus. Sf9 insect cells infected with a baculovirus expressing measles H protein and b-galactosidase were incubated with Bluogal substrate, washed\nwith PBS, and added to the vaccinia virus-infected cells. Binding of blue-colored insect cells to mouse cells which expressed either SCR1 and SCR2 (C) or the entire\nhuman CD46 molecule (D) was apparent.\n6150\nHSU ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nof this molecule, since complement components C3b and C4b\nhave previously been demonstrated to interact with SCR2,\nSCR3, and SCR4 (1, 12, 30). A role in signal transduction has\nrecently been proposed for CD46, and it was shown that in-\nteraction of this receptor with measles virus or monoclonal\nantibodies speci\ufb01c for SCR1 could downregulate the produc-\ntion of interleukin-12 (32). This receptor interaction could\npartially account for the immunosuppressive effects of measles\nvirus. It remains to be determined if other cellular factors\nbesides measles virus interact with the SCR1 domain. The\ndeletion of SCR1 in most tissues of New World monkeys (29)\nmay have interesting evolutionary implications in terms of dis-\nease and immune regulation.\nErythrocytes from the baboon Papio cynocephalus have pre-\nviously been reported to hemagglutinate in the presence of\nlaboratory strains of measles virus (57, 59). However, research-\ners showed that many Old World monkey erythrocytes, includ-\ning those from Papio cynocephalus, M. fascicularis, M. mulatta,\nand E. patas, were less ef\ufb01cient in these assays than erythro-\ncytes from the African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops)\n(18\u201320). We con\ufb01rmed this result with two other species of\nbaboon (Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas) and found that\nthis decreased ability to hemagglutinate corresponded to a\nchange at amino acid residue 103, which implicates this region\nof CD46 in measles virus binding. We were able to imitate this\nnatural change through site-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis, and our ex-\nperiments revealed decreased af\ufb01nity for the mutant CD46 in\nan Sf9-H binding assay. The nearby carbohydrate attachment\nsite at Asn114 was also shown to be important for optimal\nbinding, since mutation of this residue to Ala also reduced\ninteraction with Sf9-H cells. In addition, the epitope for a\nmonoclonal antibody, M75, was mapped to the same region\n(amino acids 103 to 118) by using immunoblot analysis of our\nmutant CD46 molecules, and it was also shown to inhibit bind-\ning effectively. These preceding studies appear to implicate the\nregion of CD46 consisting of amino acids 103 to 118 as at least\none of the sites involved in virus attachment.\nThe arti\ufb01cial mutation in CD46 which changed GluArg at\npositions 58 and 59 to AlaAla had a dramatic effect on Sf9-H\ncell binding. This is a region which could be involved in elec-\ntrostatic interaction with the binding region of measles virus H\nprotein. Arginine at concentrations of 1 M has previously been\nshown to abrogate virus binding and hemagglutination (37).\nThe region at amino acid 58 or 59 could contribute to salt-\ndependent or charged residue interaction during the attach-\nment process (23, 37, 76). The monoclonal antibody E4.3 has\npreviously been studied in virus attachment experiments (30,\n47). There is some discrepancy between the results from the\ntwo laboratories as to the effectiveness of this antibody in\ninhibiting the binding of H protein to target cells, which could\nbe related to the concentration of the reagent used in their\nexperiments. Our results support those of Manchester et al.\n(47) and con\ufb01rm that E4.3 was indeed a potent inhibitor of\nmeasles virus H protein attachment. We further demonstrated\nthat the epitope for monoclonal antibody E4.3 mapped to a\nregion of CD46 between amino acids 37 and 59 by using im-\nmunoblot analysis of our mutant CD46 molecules. Taken to-\ngether, these data indicate that the region of CD46 consisting\nof amino acids 37 to 59 also participates in binding to the\nmeasles virus H protein.\nThe CD4 binding region (amino acids 39 to 59) which in-\nteracts with human immunode\ufb01ciency virus glycoprotein\n(gp120) has previously been mapped by other investigators\nthrough a series of site-speci\ufb01c mutations and interactions with\nmonoclonal antibodies (5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 31, 48, 60, 72, 79).\nSynthetic peptides were also employed by other laboratories in\nattempts to map binding regions on CD4 but led to contradic-\ntory results (31, 38, 39, 64, 83). Originally we also attempted to\nperform peptide studies with measles virus and CD46 by using\n25-amino-acid peptides derived from all regions of SCR1 and\nSCR2. Peptides at concentrations as high as 200 mM had no\neffect in Sf9-H binding and measles virus infectivity assays. We\npresumed that binding of measles virus depended on confor-\nmational epitopes rather than linear peptide epitopes.

The position of the mutation is indicated\nby the amino acid residue numbered from the amino terminus of the polypep-\ntide, and includes the signal peptide prior to posttranslational cleavage. The\nletter to the left of the number indicates the original amino acid, while the letter\nto the right indicates the change. Multiple mutants 1 to 8 consist of alanine tract\nsubstitutions between the indicated positions.\nb The mean \ufb02uorescence of CD46 mutant proteins which were expressed on\nthe surface of mouse OST-7 cells was determined by FACS analysis with a rabbit\npolyclonal antibody directed against CD46. Analysis was performed three times\nwith an error of 615%. The antibody-speci\ufb01c \ufb02uorescence intensity is repre-\nsented as a number. Preimmune rabbit antibody yielded a background \ufb02uores-\ncence of 0.200 to 0.500.\nc Reactivity of the mutant CD46 molecules with monoclonal antibodies E4.3\nand M75 was determined by immunoblot analysis of proteins from a mutant\nCD46 recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cell lysate. 2, no band appeared on\nthe blot; 1, presence of a faint band; 111, indicates the monoclonal antibody\nrecognized the mutant CD46 protein.\nVOL. 71, 1997\nCD46 REGIONS IMPORTANT FOR MEASLES VIRUS BINDING\n6151\n\ntiple alanine substitutions could not be tolerated. These mul-\ntiple mutations appeared to perturb binding of Sf9-H cells to\nCD46, no matter which region was targeted. Surface expres-\nsion of the mutated CD46 molecule was not affected, but\nintramolecular disul\ufb01de bond formation may have been al-\ntered. The only area where multiple alanine mutations did not\ndramatically affect binding was the hinge region between SCR1\nand SCR2, indicating that this region was relatively refractile\nto mutagenesis and probably was not important in measles\nvirus binding. Smaller point mutations were subsequently uti-\nlized in our experiments to map regions in SCR1 and SCR2\nwhich are important for measles virus binding.\nA molecular understanding of the exact interaction of mea-\nsles virus H protein with CD46 will ultimately depend upon\nstructural studies using nuclear magnetic resonance or X-ray\ncrystallography to dissect the binding regions of H, SCR1, and\nSCR2. Serum factor H, like CD46, is another complement\nbinding protein which is composed of 20 short consensus re-\ngions. The SCR15 and SCR16 regions of factor H, whose\nthree-dimensional structure has been solved (7), has some\nhomology to the two terminal domains of CD46. The polypep-\ntide backbone for CD46-SCR1 and CD46-SCR2 can be\ncrudely modeled and superimposed on that for the SCR15 and\nSCR16 domains from factor H. However, one can only approx-\nimate regions of interaction between the receptor and viral\nglycoprotein at this time. The \ufb01ne structure of the intramolec-\nular loops de\ufb01ned by the cysteine residues and the orientation\nof the SCR domains about the hinge region between SCR1 and\nSCR2 will likely determine the residues available in the bind-\ning site. Mutagenesis offers some clues as to which residues are\nimportant in virus binding, but these experiments are actually\na lead into structural studies.\nBased on the deletion of SCR1 regions in New World mon-\nkeys, we might predict that marmosets and tamarins from\nSouth America are resistant to infections by the Edmonston\nstrain of measles virus. Studies in our laboratory indicate that\nowl monkey kidney cells (OMK) and marmoset kidney cells\n(NZP-60) also contain this deletion and cannot be infected\nwith measles virus in the laboratory (29). However, we and\nothers (33) have infected a marmoset B-cell line which has\nbeen immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus (B95-8), and results\nindicate that these cells contain both the SCR1-deleted and\nnondeleted forms of CD46 (29). Other researchers have re-\nported measles virus infections in cynomolgus monkeys, mar-\nFIG. 4. Effect of CD46 site-speci\ufb01c mutations and monoclonal antibodies directed against SCR1 and SCR2 on binding to insect cells expressing the measles virus\nH protein. Mouse OST-7 cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the mutant CD46 molecules described in Table 2. Sf9 insect cells which\nexpressed both measles virus H protein and b-galactosidase were added to the mouse cells for 1/2 h and subsequently washed with PBS. Binding was quantitated by\na colorimetric assay for b-galactosidase with ONPG as a substrate and was compared to a standard value produced by cells expressing the normal CD46 molecule. This\nbinding relative to that for normal human CD46 is represented on the y axis of the histogram, while the various mutations are listed on the x axis. OST-7 cells infected\nwith wild-type vaccinia virus served as a negative control and exhibited no binding to Sf9-H cells. (A) Mutations introduced in SCR1; (B) mutations placed in SCR2;\n(C) multiple alanine substitutions in both SCR1 and SCR2. The inhibitory effects of monoclonal antibodies directed against SCR1 (E4.3) and SCR2 (M75) are also\nshown in panel C.

The disease\nin moustached marmosets has been reported to be character-\nized by severe gastroenterocolitis and immunosuppression (2),\nwhile the symptoms presented by squirrel monkeys are similar\nto those in humans and consist of a rash, Koplik\u2019s spots, and\ninfection of lymphatic tissue (34). The receptor distribution in\nthese animals is currently under study in our laboratory, and\nthe nature of the SCR1 deletion in different organs of monkeys\nmay determine the tissue tropism and nature of the disease in\nthese animals. Since the SCR1 measles virus binding domain\nappears to be missing in these infected New World monkeys, it\nwill be interesting to determine if another receptor besides\nCD46 can be used by measles virus during the process of\nattachment.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the Amgen DNA sequencing facility and Laarni Antonio\nat Thousand Oaks, Calif., for sequencing the different primate CD46\nclones and mutants.

This\nreceptor consists of four short consensus regions (SCR1 to SCR4) which normally function in complement\nregulation. Measles virus has recently been shown to interact with SCR1 and SCR2. 1n this study, receptors\non different types of monkey erythrocytes were employed as \u201cnatural mutant proteins\u201d to further de\ufb01ne the\nvirus binding regions of CD46. Erythrocytes from African green monkeys and rhesus macaques hemagglutinate\nin the presence of measles virus, while baboon erythrocytes were the least ef\ufb01cient of the Old World monkey\ncells used in these assays. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the SCR2 domain of baboon CD46 contained\nan Arg-to-Gln mutation at amino acid position 103 which accounted for reduced hemagglutination activity.\nSurprisingly, none of the New World monkey erythrocytes hemagglutinated in the presence of virus. Sequenc-\ning of cDNAs derived from the lymphocytes of these New World monkeys and analysis of their erythrocytes with\nSCR1-speci\ufb01c polyclonal antibodies indicated that the SCR1 domain was deleted in these cells. Additional\nexperiments, which used 35 different site-speci\ufb01c mutations inserted into CD46, were performed to complement\nthe preceding studies. The effects of these arti\ufb01cial mutations were documented with a convenient binding\nassay using insect cells expressing the measles virus hemagglutinin. Mutations which mimicked the change\nfound in baboon CD46 or another which deleted the SCR2 glycosylation site reduced binding substantially.\nAnother mutation which altered GluArg to AlaAla at positions 58 and 59, totally abolished binding. Finally, the\nepitopes for two monoclonal antibodies which inhibit measles virus attachment were mapped to the same\nregions implicated by mutagenesis.\nCD46, also known as membrane cofactor protein, was re-\ncently shown to be a primate-speci\ufb01c receptor for the labora-\ntory-adapted Edmonston strain of measles virus (15, 16, 22,\n50). This surface glycoprotein is expressed on most types of\ncells and normally functions as a regulator of complement\nactivity and helps to protect self tissue from autoimmune de-\nstruction (40, 41). CD46 is composed of four extracellular\nshort consensus domains (SCR1, SCR2, SCR3, and SCR4)\nfollowed by a region rich in serine, threonine, and proline\n(called STP), a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic\ndomain at its carboxyl terminus. Variations in splicing of exons\nencoding STP cassettes and cytoplasmic regions yield glyco-\nproteins which vary in size from 57 to 67 kDa and consist of all\nfour SCR domains, a combination of STP regions, and one of\ntwo different possible carboxy termini (62, 63, 71). Each of the\nknown splicing variants of human CD46 is capable of binding\nmeasles virus (21, 46).\nThe CD46 binding domains for the laboratory-adapted Ed-\nmonston strain of measles virus have recently been mapped to\nSCR1 and SCR2 (47) by using chimeric recombinant mole-\ncules composed of parts of CD46 and a related molecule called\nCD55, or decay-accelerating factor. Another group has done\nsimilar experiments with chimeras of CD46 and CD4 (11),\nwhile others expressed CD46 deletion mutants in Chinese\nhamster ovary cells (30) and con\ufb01rmed the role of SCR1 and\nSCR2 in virus binding. Monoclonal antibodies speci\ufb01c for\nSCR1 and SCR2 also block measles virus binding to the host\ncell (30, 47). The role of carbohydrate linked to the asparagine\nresidue in the SCR1 domain of CD46 appears to be minimal,\nwhile carbohydrate associated with asparagine in SCR2 ap-\npears to be critical for binding measles virus (42, 43).\nMeasles virus (25, 78) is a paramyxovirus which consists of a\nnegative-strand RNA genome and an envelope which contains\ntwo surface glycoproteins known as hemagglutinin protein (H)\nand membrane fusion protein (F). A nonglycosylated mem-\nbrane protein (M) lies on the imer side of the envelope and\nmediates an association of the glycoproteins with the nucleo-\ncapsid of the virus. H protein is responsible for virus attach-\nment and interacts with CD46 (4, 14, 42), while F mediates\npenetration and syncytium formation (45, 65, 67, 70, 82). 1n-\nteraction of H with its receptor has been shown to downregu-\nlate surface CD46 in cultured cells (28, 35, 49, 73\u201375), and four\namino acids on the virus attachment protein have recently\nbeen implicated in this interaction (8). 1n addition, virus grown\nin cultured cells binds to the receptors on many, but not all,\nspecies of monkey erythrocytes to yield hemagglutination (20,\n53\u201355, 57\u201359, 69). Hemagglutination assays with erythrocytes\nfrom cercopithecus and rhesus monkeys have traditionally\nbeen used to determine titers of laboratory strains of measles\n* Corresponding author.

However, the\nerythrocytes of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas do not hem-\nagglutinate in the presence of measles virus, which correlates\nwith the absence of CD46 on the surfaces of erythrocytes from\nthese higher primates (19, 52).\nSince a number of species of monkey erythrocytes vary in\ntheir ability to bind measles virus and subsequently hemagglu-\ntinate (18\u201320), we proposed to use the receptors on these\nerythrocytes as \u201cnatural mutant proteins\u201d in an attempt to\nfurther de\ufb01ne the binding regions of CD46. 1n this work, we\n\ufb01rst studied the ability of New World and Old World monkey\nerythrocytes to hemagglutinate in the presence of measles vi-\nrus. Surprisingly, none of the New World monkey erythrocytes\nhemagglutinated in the presence of measles virus, although it\nwas evident that they expressed CD46 on their cell surfaces.\nThe CD46 molecules from the lymphocytes and erythrocytes of\nNew World monkeys all lacked the SCR1 coding region adja-\ncent to the amino-terminal signal peptide. A speci\ufb01c mutation\npresent within the CD46 molecules of baboons which could\naccount for diminished hemagglutination activity in the pres-\nence of measles virus was noted. 1n addition, the effects of\ncertain arti\ufb01cial mutations introduced into CD46 by site-spe-\nci\ufb01c mutagenesis are reported.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell lines and virus. HeLa, Vero, and HuTK-143B cells were purchased from\nthe American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.). Sf9 insect cells were\nsupplied by 1nvitrogen (San Diego, Calif.) and were grown in Grace\u2019s medium.\nHeLa, Vero, and HuTK-143B cells were propagated in Dulbecco\u2019s minimum\nessential medium (GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.) supplemented with 10%\nfetal calf serum. 1n addition, HuTK-143B cells were cultivated in the presence of\n12.5 mg of bromodeoxyuridine per ml. Monkey (cercopithecus, cynomologus, and\nrhesus) erythrocytes were purchased from Comaught Laboratories (Toronto,\nCanada), and baboon erythrocytes came from Lampire Biological Laboratories\n(Pipersville, Pa.). Other monkey erythrocytes were obtained from the Granby\nZoo (Granby, Canada), the Montreal Biodome (Montreal, Canada), the Quebec\nCity Zoo (Quebec City, Canada), the Toronto Metropolitan Zoo (Toronto,\nCanada), the National 1nstitutes of Health primate center (Poolesville, Md.),\nMerck-Frosst Pharmaceuticals (Montreal, Canada), and the New England Pri-\nmate Center (Boston, Mass.). The Edmonston strain of measles virus was orig-\ninally obtained from Erling Norrby (Karolinska 1nstitute, Stockholm, Sweden)\nand was propagated in Vero monkey kidney cells as previously described (24).\nCD46 polypeptide expression and production of antibodies. Polyclonal anti-\nbodies (CD46-333) directed against entire CD46 protein and antiserum directed\nagainst the SCR1 domain of CD46 protein were prepared by immunization of\nrabbits with puri\ufb01ed recombinant protein. The entire CD46-coding region (iso-\ntype C2) was synthesized by PCR with oligonucleotide primers as previously\ndescribed (15). The DNA fragment was cloned into the NheI site of the bacu-\nlovirus expression vector BlueBac2 (pETL), and recombinant baculovirus was\ngenerated (36, 68, 80). Recombinant CD46 protein was expressed in Sf9 insect\ncells, resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, electro-\neluted, and injected into rabbits to generate a polyclonal antibody by routine\nmethods (66, 81). A DNA fragment containing SCR1 was synthesized by PCR\nwith\noligonucleotide\nprimers\ncorresponding\nto\nthe\n59\nend\n(59-AACGGATCCT-GTGAGGAGCCACCAACA-39)\nand\nthe\n39\nend\n(59-TGGTGTTCGAAAATTGTCCGCAGTAGA-CTCTG-39) of the SCR1-\ncoding sequence. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and\nthen cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pT7-7His cut with the same\nenzymes (77). The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli\nBL21(DE3) by electroporation, and the recombinant protein was expressed by\ninduction with 0.4 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The SCR1\npolypeptide fused to His6 was puri\ufb01ed by metal chelation chromotography with\nNi-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions (61). Pu-\nri\ufb01ed SCR1 polypeptide was injected into rabbits for the production of poly-\nclonal antibodies (27). 1n addition, the monoclonal antibody E4.3 (speci\ufb01c for\nSCR1) was purchased from Bio/Can Scienti\ufb01c (Mississauga, Canada), and mono-\nclonal antibody M75 (speci\ufb01c for SCR2) came from Seikugaku 1nc. (Tokyo,\nJapan).\nHemagglutination of different primate erythrocytes by measles virus. Primate\nblood samples were collected from animals in Vacutainer tubes containing hep-\narin-EDTA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) and stored in Alsevier\u2019s\nsolution (GIBCO-BRL) for no more than 2 days. Cells were washed two times\nwith phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and a 1% (vol/vol) solution was used in\nthe hemagglutination assays. A standard sample of concentrated measles virus\n(107 PFU/ml) was diluted serially (1:1) with PBS, and 50 ml of each dilution was\nadded to individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate with round-bottom cham-\nbers (Costar, Cambridge, Mass.). A 50-ml sample of the erythrocytes was added\nto each well. Hemagglutination was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Erythro-\ncytes settled to the bottom of the chambers when the assay was negative but\nformed a suspended matrix when the assay was positive. The assay titer was the\nhighest dilution of virus which produced hemagglutination. 1solation of monkey lymphocytes and synthesis of cDNAs from CD46 mRNA.\nLymphocytes from different monkey species were prepared by using a Ficoll-\nPaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) discontinuous gradient. Fresh monkey\nblood (2 to 3 ml) was diluted with an equal volume of balanced salt solution\n(0.01% anhydrous D-glucose, 5 mM CaCl2, 98 mM MgCl2, 0.545 mM KCl, 0.126\nM NaCl, and 14.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and layered onto 3 ml of Ficoll-Paque.\nThe sample was centrifuged at 700 3 g for 30 min at 20\u00b0C. The lymphocyte layer\nat the balanced salt solution\u2013Ficoll-Paque interface was collected and diluted\nwith 3 volumes of balanced salt solution. Following centrifugation at 700 3 g for\n10 min at 20\u00b0C, the lymphocyte pellet was washed once with 1 ml of balanced salt\nsolution and then resuspended in 1 ml of TRIzol (GIBCO-BRL). Chloroform\n(0.2 ml) was added, and the TRIzol lysate was vortexed and left for 3 min at room\ntemperature. The denatured extract was centrifuged at 10,000 3 g for 10 min at\n4\u00b0C. RNA in the upper aqueous layer was then precipitated with 0.5 ml of\nisopropanol at room temperature for 10 min and then concentrated by centrif-\nugation at 10,000 3 g for 10 min. Finally, the pellet was washed once with 75%\nethanol, dried in the air, and resuspended in 50 ml of H2O. Synthesis of cDNA\nwas performed from mRNA by using the First Strand Synthesis kit (Pharmacia)\nand a speci\ufb01c CD46 primer (59-GGGACAACACAAATTACTGC-39). Double-\nstranded DNA fragments were generated by nested PCRs. Primers derived from\nthe\nhuman\nCD46\nsequence\ncorresponding\nto\n59-GCAACTCCAACAACTATGGC-39\nand\n59-AGTGTCCCTTTCCTTCCTG-39 were used for the \ufb01rst 30 rounds of PCR\nampli\ufb01cation. 1nterior,\nor\nnested,\nprimers\ncorresponding\nto\n59-ACAATCACAGCAATGACCCA-39\nand\n59-CGCTTTCCTGGGTTGCTTC-39 of human CD46 were used for the follow-\ning 30 rounds of PCR.\nDetermination of the 5*-terminal sequences of CD46 mRNA. The 59-terminal\ncoding regions of different monkey CD46 molecules were determined by using\nthe Marathon cDNA Ampli\ufb01cation Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) as described\nin the reference manual. Poly(A)1 RNA was \ufb01rst isolated from total RNA by\nusing a QuickPrep mRNA puri\ufb01cation kit (Pharmacia). Reverse transcriptase\n(RT) and an oligo(dT) primer were used to synthesize the \ufb01rst-strand cDNA\nfrom 1 mg of poly(A)1 RNA. The second-strand DNA was synthesized by using\na mixture of RNase H, DNA polymerase 1, DNA ligase, and then T4 DNA\npolymerase (26). The Marathon cDNA adapter was ligated to the double-\nstranded DNA after synthesis of second-strand cDNA. Monkey CD46 fragment\ncontaining the 59 coding region was generated by nested PCR with a human\nCD46-speci\ufb01c primer (59-TAAGACACTTTGGAACTGGG-39) and the Mara-\nthon\ncDNA\nadapter-speci\ufb01c\nprimer\nAP1\n(59-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-39) for the \ufb01rst 30 rounds of\nPCR and with a human CD46-speci\ufb01c nested primer (59--39) and the Marathon\ncDNA\nadapter-speci\ufb01c\nnested\nprimer\nAP2\n(59-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-39) for the next 30 rounds of PCR\nampli\ufb01cation. CD46 DNA fragments from the different monkeys were rendered\nblunt with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, Calif.) and then cloned into\nthe SrfI site of the PCR Script Amp (SK1) vector (Stratagene).\nSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. SDS-poly-\nacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblot analysis were per-\nformed as previously described (81). The E4.3 and M75 monoclonal antibodies\n(1:500 dilution) were incubated with nitrocellulose paper blotted with total\nproteins from OST-7 cells infected with mutant CD46 recombinant virus. Bind-\ning of monoclonal antibodies was detected by ECL chemiluminescence (Amer-\nsham, Arlington Heights, 1ll.).\nDNA sequencing. DNA fragments contained in PCR-Script AmP (SK(1)\nvectors were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems 430I automated sequencer\nlocated at the Amgen DNA sequencing facility (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif.).\nSequence analysis and alignments were performed with Lasergene software\n(DNASTAR, Madison, Wis.).\nFlow cytometry analysis of monkey erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Monkey\nblood (50 ml) was centrifuged at 1,500 3 g for 5 min, washed twice with 5 ml of\n\ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine\nserum albumin, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% sodium azide). The erythrocytes were\nresuspended in 100 ml of the same buffer containing a 1:100 dilution of either\npreimmune antibody, CD46-333 antibody, or SCR1 antibody for 1 h on ice.\nFollowing the incubation, cells were washed twice with 3 ml of FACS buffer by\ncentrifugation at 1,500 3 g for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in 100 ml of the\nsame buffer containing a 1:100 dilution of \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-\nlabeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (heavy plus light chains) for 1 h on\nice. After being washed twice with 3 ml of FACS buffer, the blood cells were\nsuspended in 0.5 ml of FACS buffer and were subsequently analyzed on a Becton\nDickinson analyzer equipped with a 15-mW argon laser at 488 nm. The data were\ncollected and analyzed with CellQuest software.\nMonkey lymphocytes were also analyzed by \ufb02ow cytometry. The monkey blood\nsamples were prepared and labeled as described above. Following the incubation\nVOL. 71, 1997\nCD46 REGIONS 1MPORTANT FOR MEASLES VIRUS BINDING\n6145\n\nwith FITC-labeled anti-rabbit 1gG, the cells were washed and resuspended in 100\nml of FACS buffer. Erythrocytes were lysed by treatment of each sample with 1\nml of FACS lysis buffer (Becton Dickinson) for 1 min. The lymphocytes were\nwashed twice with 3 ml of FACS buffer, and monkey lymphocyte \ufb02uorescence\ndata were collected as described in the previous paragraph. Mouse OST7 cells\n(2 3 106 cells) which expressed mutant forms of CD46 were suspended in 1 ml\nof Cell Dissociation Buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and washed two times by\ncentrifugation with FACS buffer. The \ufb01nal pellet was suspended in 100 ml of\nFACS buffer prior to analysis by \ufb02uorescence cytometry.\nSite-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis of CD46 and expression of mutants by using vac-\ncinia virus recombinants. Portions of SCR1 and SCR2 domains were replaced\nwith point mutations or four to six alanine residues by using gel-puri\ufb01ed oligo-\nnucleotides consisting of 30 to 40 nucleotides. Mutations were introduced into\nthe CD46 molecule by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from\nStratagene. The CD46-coding region (isotype C2) was cloned into PCR-Script\nAmp SK(1) plasmid, denatured, and amealed with two complementary oligo-\nnucleotides containing the desired mutation; the mutagenized DNA strands were\nextended with Pfu polymerase; the methylated nonmutated parental DNA tem-\nplate was digested with DpnI; and the mutated plasmid was used to transform\nXL2-Blue ultracompetent cells. Mutant plasmids were isolated, and the CD46\ninserts were completely sequenced. The mutagenized CD46-coding regions were\nexcised from the PCR-Script plasmid following digestion with BspHI (59 end)\nand BglII (39 end) and ligated into the vaccinia virus vector pTM1 (containing the\nT7 promoter) which had been digested with the compatible restriction enzymes\nNcoI and BamHI. Vaccinia virus recombinants were prepared and titers were\ndetermined by plaque assays as previously described, using HuTK-143B cells and\nbromodeoxyuridine selection (17). CD46 mutants were expressed in mouse\nOST-7 cells which contained the T7 polymerase, and protein synthesis and\nsurface expression were monitored by Western immunoblot and FACS scan\nanalysis.\nDirect binding assays between CD46 mutants and insect cells expressing\nmeasles virus H protein. Mutant CD46-coding sequences were cloned into the\npTM1 vaccinia virus expression vector, which uses the T7 promoter to direct\ntranscription of the foreign gene. Recombinant vaccinia virus was prepared as\npreviously described (17), and mutant CD46 molecules were expressed in mouse\nOST7 cells which contain the T7 polymerase. Sf9 insect cells were infected for\n48 h with a recombinant baculovirus (81) which had been generated with the\nBlueBac2 expression vector (Invitrogen) (36, 68) and synthesized both the mea-\nsles virus H protein and b-galactosidase. The insect cells were colored blue by\nadding Bluogal (GIBCO-BRL, Grand 1sland, N.Y.), at 36 h of infection, from a\nstock solution (50 mg/ml in dimethylformamide) to give a 0.05% (wt/vol) \ufb01nal\nconcentration. 1nfections with recombinant vaccinia virus were allowed to pro-\nceed for 12 h; Sf9 insect cells expressing the measles H protein and b-galacto-\nsidase were incubated for 1/2 h with the vaccinia virus-infected mouse OST7 cells\nin the presence of PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum. Nonadsorbed insect cells\nwere eluted by washing the mouse cells two times with PBS. Binding in 25-cm2\ntissue culture \ufb02asks could be quantitated visually under a microscope or quan-\ntitatively by the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenylgalactoside (ONPG) with a b-galac-\ntosidase assay kit (Stratagene). Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of 100 mM sodium\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% Nonidet P-40.\nAliquots of lysate (50 ml) were added to a 96-well microtitration plate, and\nfreshly prepared buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4,\n50 mM b-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) was mixed with each aliquot to give a \ufb01nal\nvolume of 160 ml. A 50-ml volume of ONPG solution (4 mg/ml in 100 mM sodium\nphosphate, pH 7.5) was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C until a yellow\ncolor was evident, after about 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition\nof 90 ml of 1 M Na2CO3, and the color intensity was measured at 420 nm with a\nSpectraMax 250 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader purchased\nfrom Molecular Devices (Sumyvale, Calif.). Results were linear over time for an\nabsorbance range of 0.1 to 1 A420 unit.\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers.

Certain monkey erythrocytes are known to bind measles\nvirus and have been routinely used to determine titers of mea-\nsles virus in hemagglutination assays (19, 56). However, it is\nknown that human and chimpanzee erythrocytes do not hem-\nagglutinate in the presence of measles virus (19, 54). This can\nnow be attributed to the fact that the erythrocytes of humans,\ngorillas, and chimpanzees do not have CD46, the receptor for\nmeasles virus, on their cell surfaces (52). African green mon-\nkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) erythrocytes are known to be most\nsensitive to measles virus-induced agglutination (18, 20, 69).\nWe collected erythrocytes from a number of Old World and\nNew World monkeys and assayed their ability to hemaggluti-\nnate in the presence of Edmonston measles virus which had\nbeen propagated in Vero monkey kidney cells (Table 1). The\npresence of CD46 on the surfaces of these monkey erythro-\ncytes was \ufb01rst veri\ufb01ed by \ufb02uorescence analysis with a poly-\nclonal antibody speci\ufb01c for human CD46. All primate eryth-\nrocytes which were tested, with the exception of human and\nchimpanzee erythrocytes, bound the CD46 antibody. Levels of\nimmune recognition were probably less in Lemur macaco due\nto species-speci\ufb01c variation of its CD46 protein. Hemaggluti-\nnation assays mediated by measles virus were performed, and\nit was obvious that erythrocytes from South American marmo-\nsets and tamarins (Callimico goeldii, Callithrix jacchus, Pithecia\npithecia, Saimiri sciureus, and Leontopithecus rosalia) and\nMadagascar lemur failed to bind measles virus (Table 1). Old\nWorld monkey erythrocytes varied in their ability to hemag-\nglutinate in the presence of the virus. As expected, human and\nchimpanzee erythrocytes did not hemagglutinate, while Cerco-\npithecus aethiops, Cercopithecus diana, M. fascicularis, M. mu-\nlatta, Erythrocebus patas, and Cercocebus torquatus lunulatus\nyielded high hemagglutination titers. Cercopithecus monkeys\nconsistently yielded slightly higher hemagglutination titers\nthan the rest of the monkeys, as previously reported (18, 20).\nOn the other hand, erythrocytes from baboons (Papio anubis\nand Papio hamadryas) always produced much lower titers in\nTABLE 1.

The larger dilution indicated an increased ability of the erythrocytes to\nhemagglutinate in the presence of measles virus; less virus was required to\ncross-link erythrocytes and maintain them in suspension. Assays with Old World\nmonkey erythrocytes were performed four times and averaged.\n6146\nHSU ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nour assays. We proposed to isolate mRNA from the lympho-\ncytes of these monkeys, synthesize cDNA, and sequence the\nregions coding for the extracellular domains of CD46 in an\nattempt to explain the species-speci\ufb01c variation in hemagglu-\ntination titers exhibited by these different erythrocytes.\nSequence comparisons of CD46 extracellular domains from\ndifferent primates. Lymphocytes were isolated from the blood\nof different monkeys, and cDNAs were prepared by using\nspeci\ufb01c primers and RT, followed by PCR (RT-PCR). The\npredicted amino acid sequence was deduced from at least\nthree separate PCRs for each type of monkey. Subsequently,\nthe signal peptide and short consensus regions (SCR1 to\nSCR4) were aligned by using the Clustal program from Laser-\ngene (Fig. 1). Overall, the CD46 molecules from the different\nprimates were highly conserved, and the protein sequences of\nthe SCR3 and SCR4 regions from all the primates were ex-\ntremely similar. The SCR3 and SCR4 domains of Old World\nmacaques exhibited 93% identity to the human sequence,\nFIG. 1. Amino acid sequence alignment of signal peptides and short consensus regions from CD46 molecules found in lymphocytes of Old World and New World\nmonkeys. Blood samples were obtained from a variety of primates originating from either Africa or South America. Lymphocytes were isolated by gradient\ncentrifugation, total RNA was extracted, and cDNA was prepared with RT by using speci\ufb01c oligonucleotide primers from the conserved STP and transmembrane\ndomains. DNA sequences were ampli\ufb01ed by using conserved oligonucleotides upstream of the signal peptide region and regions adjacent to the SCR4 regions. The\n59 ends of New World monkeys were also cloned by rapid ampli\ufb01cation of cDNA ends with a conserved primer from the SCR3 region. At least three independent cDNA\nclones were sequenced, translated to yield a predicted protein, and aligned by using the Clustal method in the Lasergene DNA analysis package. Residues which differ\nfrom the human consensus are shaded. Old World primates include humans (Homo sapiens), cynomolgus monkeys (M. fascicularis), rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta),\nbaboons (Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas), and African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops). New World primates which we tested were the common marmoset\n(Callithrix jacchus), Goeldii\u2019s marmoset (Callimico goeldii), the moustached marmoset (Saguinus mystax), the white-faced saki (Pithecia pithecia), the owl monkey (A.\ntrivirgatus), and the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). The signal peptide and SCR1, SCR2, and SCR3 regions are indicated by solid lines beneath the sequences. The\nSCR4 domain is not shown, since it was very similar for all monkeys tested. The mutation found in baboon CD46 at amino acid 103 is highlighted by a solid box.\nVOL. 71, 1997\nCD46 REGIONS 1MPORTANT FOR MEASLES VIRUS BINDING\n6147\n\nwhile those of New World monkeys were 80% identical. This\nconservation seems consistent with the role of these regions of\nCD46 in complement regulation (40, 41). Since the SCR4\nsequence is very similar for all monkeys, it is not shown in Fig.\n1. The conserved amino-terminal signal peptides, STP regions,\nand membrane-spaming regions facilitated RT-PCR across\nthe extracellular domain of CD46. 1t was immediately evident\nthat the coding region for SCR1 (consisting of 63 amino acids)\nwas missing from the cDNAs derived from the mRNAs of New\nWorld monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, Pithecia pithecia, Callimico\ngoeldii, A. trivirgatus, and Saimiri sciureus). The observation\nthat the SCR1-coding region was missing from mRNAs of\nlymphocytes and erythrocyte precursors of New World mon-\nkeys explains why the erythrocytes of New World monkeys did\nnot hemagglutinate in the presence of measles virus, since this\nregion has previously been implicated in measles virus binding\n(30, 47). The SCR2 region varied most from the human se-\nquence for both Old World and New World monkeys. This\nregion was 73% identical to the human SCR2 for Old World\nmonkeys and 68% identical for New World monkeys. Con-\nserved regions of identity might be expected to participate in\nbinding to the measles virus H protein.\nThe CD46 sequences for different classes of Old and New\nWorld monkeys resembled each other and could clearly be\nused to classify the primates into different groups. Baboons,\nmacaques, and African green monkeys belong to the family\nCercopithecidae (51), and all have similar changes at 28 posi-\ntions in the signal peptide and SCR regions when compared to\nthe same extracellular portion of human CD46. Bands of\namino acid identity at over 22 positions could easily differen-\ntiate whether the CD46 sequence belonged to an Old or New\nWorld monkey. South American monkeys could be further\nsubclassi\ufb01ed on the basis of 10 additional variations in the\nsequence shown in Fig. 1. Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus and\nCallimico goeldii) and tamarins (Saguinus mystax, Saguinus oe-\ndipus, and Leontipithecus rosalia) belong to the Callithrichidae\nfamily (51). On the other hand, squirrel monkeys (Saimiri\nsciureus), owl monkeys (A. trivirgatus), and white-faced sakis\n(Pithecia pithecia) are members of the Cebidae family (51).\nThese family af\ufb01liations are re\ufb02ected in amino acid variations\nfound in the external domains of CD46 (Fig. 1).\nCD46 sequences from baboons contained only seven amino\nacid changes when compared to the cercopithecus monkey\nsequence; six of these changes (positions 71, 92, 106, 113, 149,\nand 172) were conservative, but the other change, at position\n103, produced an Arg-to-Gln substitution. This change might\naccount for the reduced hemagglutination properties of ba-\nboon erythrocytes and was considered in subsequent studies.\nCynomolgus (M. fascicularis) and rhesus (M. mulatta) monkey\nCD46 sequences were almost identical to the sequence of\nCercopithecus aethiops, and all changes were minor and con-\nservative. A slightly greater level of CD46 cell surface expres-\nsion on the erythrocytes of Cercopithecus aethiops and Cerco-\npithecus diana could explain the consistent difference in\nhemagglutination between cercopithecus monkeys and ma-\ncaques (Table 1). 1t should also be noted that the Edmonston\nstrain of measles virus has been routinely propagated in Vero\nand CV-1 cells, which are derived from the kidneys of an\nAfrican green monkey. Propagation of this laboratory strain in\nculture would ultimately favor the binding of measles virus to\nthe Cercophithecus aethiops CD46 receptor over those of other\nmonkeys.\nConserved blocks of amino acids in the SCR1 and SCR2\nregions could give some clues as to which regions are most\nimportant in binding to measles virus. SCR1 regions between\namino acids 37 to 54 and 56 to 91 seem to be almost identical\nin the Old World monkeys. 1n addition, SCR2 regions consist-\ning of residues 96 to 99, 103 to 109, 113 to 117, 124 to 135, 137\nto 144, and 146 to 162 are almost identical in CD46 molecules\nfrom the Old World monkeys and could contribute to virus\nbinding. Glycosylation sites at Asn83 and Asn114 are abso-\nlutely retained, 6 of 8 cysteine residues are conserved, and the\n13 prolines are maintained at all positions except residues 100,\n104, and 112. 1t was interesting that baboons, macaques, and\nAfrican green monkeys contained another potential glycosyla-\ntion site in their SCR3 domain at residue 213. However, this\nshould not affect binding to H, since this region of CD46 does\nnot appear to interact with the virus during attachment.\nPolyclonal antibodies con\ufb01rm that the SCR1 region is ab-\nsent from CD46 molecules expressed on the erythrocytes and\nlymphocytes from New World monkeys. SCR1 polypeptides\n(amino acids 30 to 91) derived from CD46 were expressed in E.\ncoli, and recombinant protein was puri\ufb01ed and injected into\nrabbits in order to generate polyclonal antibodies. These anti-\nbodies were used to study surface expression of SCR1 on\nerythrocytes, lymphocytes, and a number of cell lines from Old\nand New World monkeys by \ufb02uorescent-antibody analysis. A\npolyclonal antibody directed against the entire CD46 molecule\nindicated that the erythrocytes from most Old and all New\nWorld monkeys express CD46 on their cell surface (Fig. 2).\nHowever, SCR1-speci\ufb01c antibodies clearly con\ufb01rmed that the\nerythrocytes of Old World monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops,\nM. mulatta, M. fascicularis, and Papio anubis) expressed the\nSCR1 domain of CD46 on their surface (Fig. 2A), while anal-\nysis of New World monkeys (A. trivirgatus, Saimiri sciureus,\nCallithrix jacchus, and Saguinus oedipus) showed that it was\nabsent (Fig. 2B). Analysis of lymphocytes, following lysis of\nerythrocytes, gave identical results (data not shown). This re-\nsult con\ufb01rmed our RT-PCR analysis of mRNA derived from\nlymphocytes and explained why New World monkey erythro-\ncytes did not hemagglutinate in the presence of the laboratory\nstrain of Edmonston measles virus, since the SCR1 domain has\nbeen implicated in measles virus binding (30, 47).\nA convenient binding assay with Sf9 insect cells expressing\nmeasles virus H protein and b-galactosidase can be used to\nstudy the binding domains of CD46. Our laboratory previously\ndemonstrated that Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant\nbaculovirus expressing the measles virus H protein (Sf9-H)\nwere capable of binding to erythrocytes from African green\nmonkeys (80). Since recombinant baculovirus was derived by\nusing the BlueBac2 (pETL) expression vector (36, 68), the\ninsect cells expressed b-galactosidase as well as measles virus\nH protein. We reasoned that these infected Sf9 cells grown in\nsuspension should be capable of binding to mammalian cells\nwith CD46 at their cell surface. Preliminary studies demon-\nstrated that Sf9-H cells could indeed bind to HeLa cells and in\naddition could be stained blue in the presence of Bluogal, a\nsubstrate for b-galactosidase (29). Control Sf9 insect cells in-\nfected with wild-type Autographa californica nuclear polyhe-\ndrosis virus did not adhere to target cells and could be washed\naway. A mouse cell line containing the T7 polymerase gene\n(OST-7) does not normally bind measles virus. When infected\nwith a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing human CD46\nunder control of the T7 promoter, these rodent cells could bind\nthe Sf9-H cells (Fig. 3D). Mouse cells infected with wild-type\nvaccinia virus or a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the\nSCR1, STP, and transmembrane regions of CD46 could not\nbind the Sf9-H cells (Fig. 3A and B). However, mouse OST-7\ncells infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the\nSCR1, SCR2, STP, and transmembrane regions (Fig. 3C)\ncould bind Sf9-H cells just as well as if they were infected with\nvaccinia virus synthesizing the whole CD46 molecule (Fig. 3D).\n6148\nHSU ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nThese results con\ufb01rm previous \ufb01ndings (11, 30, 47) which show\nthat both the SCR1 and SCR2 domains of CD46 are required\nfor measles virus binding. The results presented in Fig. 3 attest\nto the credibility of this assay and establish a simple direct\nbinding assay for interaction between measles virus H protein\nand the human CD46 molecule. Previous investigators moni-\ntored this binding indirectly through the ability of measles virus\nto initiate infection in rodent cells expressing CD46 variants\n(47), \ufb02uorescence microscopy with measles antibodies (47),\n\ufb02uorescence cytometry measurements with H monoclonal an-\ntibody (30, 50), or the ability to form rosettes between African\ngreen monkey erythrocytes and the CD46-bearing target cell\n(15) or semiquantitatively with a biotinylated H protein overlay\nbinding assay with nitrocellulose blots containing CD46 (42).\nOur new binding assay with Sf9-H cells offers the advantages of\nbeing quick, sensitive, and easy to quantitate with either Bluo-\ngal or ONPG substrates.\nSite-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis can be used to map regions of\nCD46 important for interaction of the H protein. Binding of\nmeasles virus to African green monkey erythrocytes has pre-\nviously been reported to be reversed by incubation with 1 M\narginine, and consequently, electrostatic interactions appeared\nto be important in virus attachment (37). With this result in\nmind, we decided to initiate our mutagenesis studies by sys-\ntematically replacing charged amino acids in the SCR1 and\nSCR2 domains with alanine. Larger stretches of the CD46\nbinding domains were also replaced with tracts of four to six\nalanine residues. Mutant CD46 molecules were expressed in\nmouse OST-7 cells by using recombinant vaccinia virus, and\nbinding assays were performed with Sf9-H cells. Expression of\nall CD46 mutants on the surface of OST-7 cells was analyzed\nby \ufb02uorescence cytometry, and similar amounts of recombi-\nnant protein were expressed on all cells. Levels of mutant\nCD46 surface expression are presented in Table 2. Binding of\nSf9-H cells to OST-7 cells expressing mutant CD46 molecules\nwas measured colorimetrically with an ONPG assay, and the\nresults relative to those for normal CD46 are presented in Fig.\n4.\nSubstitution of charged amino acids at the SCR1 amino\nterminus (EE36/37AA and E45A) appeared to moderately\naffect binding and led to 25 to 30% inhibition of binding.\nMutation of the glycosylation site in SCR1 at Asn83 had no\neffect on binding, nor did mutations of the charged residues\nsurrounding this site. However, the mutation ER58/59AA dra-\nmatically inhibited binding, up to 80%. Mutation of RD103/\n104AA and another N-glycosylation site (N114A) in the SCR2\ndomain caused moderate but reproducible inhibition of bind-\ning, 25 and 50%, respectively. As previously stated, the Arg\nresidue at position 103 has been replaced by a Gln in baboons\n(Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas), and we and others have\nnoted that baboon erythrocytes are not nearly as effective in\nhemagglutination assays mediated by measles virus. Changes\nat amino acid 103 appear to diminish measles virus binding but\nnot abolish it. Another laboratory also recently reported that\nthe mutation at Asn114 destroyed this glycosylation site and\nreduced infections and binding by measles virus (44). 1t has not\nbeen shown whether this carbohydrate chain participates di-\nrectly or indirectly in binding. For the most part, single amino\nacid mutations do not completely abolish binding of mutant\nforms of CD46 to Sf9-H cells. This implies that several distinct\nregions in SCR1 and SCR2 cooperate in binding in a confor-\nmational rather than a linear mamer and that no one region of\nSCR1 and SCR2 is critical for virus interaction.\nWe were surprised to observe that multiple substitutions of\nfour to six alanine residues at seven locations over the SCR1\nand SCR2 domains (E42 to G48, K49 to E55, E58 to C64, Y70\nFIG. 2. Analysis of SCR1 domains and CD46 molecules from erythrocytes of\nOld World and New World monkeys by \ufb02uorescence cytometry. Erythrocytes\nfrom monkeys were incubated with either preimmune antiserum, SCR1-speci\ufb01c\nantiserum, or polyclonal antiserum directed against human CD46. The erythro-\ncytes were subsequently washed twice with FACS buffer by low-speed centrifu-\ngation. Following resuspension of the pellet, the cells were incubated with FITC-\nlabeled goat anti-rabbit 1gG and again washed twice with FACS buffer by low-\nspeed centrifugation.

However, substitution\nof residues in the hinge region between the SCR1 and SCR2\ndomains (Y95 to T98) had little inhibitory effect. These\nchanges seem to indicate that major distortions of the SCR1\nand SCR2 domains camot be tolerated in binding assays.\nAgain, the multiple substitutions did not affect display of the\nmutant CD46 molecules on the surface of the mouse OST-7\ncells (Table 2). 1t is quite possible that multiple alanine\nmutations might disrupt intramolecular disul\ufb01de bond for-\nmation and alter the native conformation of the virus bind-\ning domains.\nMonoclonal antibodies E4.3 and M75 inhibit binding of H\nprotein by interacting with speci\ufb01c regions in SCR1 and\nSCR2. Two monoclonal antibodies which react with CD46\nwere previously reported to block measles virus infections and\nprevent attachment of the measles virus H protein to the target\ncell (15, 30). We were able to map the regions on CD46 which\ninteract with monoclonal antibodies E4.3 and M75 by using\nrecombinant vaccinia virus expressing different CD46 mutants\n(Table 2) and to show that they inhibited binding of Sf9-H cells\n(Fig. 4). E4.3 inhibited binding of normal CD46 to Sf9-H cells\nby 45%, while M75 yielded 67% inhibition. 1n order to map the\nmonoclonal antibody epitopes, OST-7 cells were infected with\nvaccinia virus recombinants, and infected cell lysates were an-\nalyzed by immunoblotting with the two monoclonal antibodies;\ndiminished reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies with mu-\ntant CD46 molecules was noted (Table 2). E4.3 antibodies\nappeared to recognize residues 36 to 59 in the amino-terminal\ndomain of SCR1, while M75 recognized amino acids 103 to\n114. These epitopes coincided with the regions where site-\nspeci\ufb01c mutations had the most effect on virus binding. 1t will\nbe interesting to note the inhibitory effects of additional mono-\nclonal antibodies which recognize other regions of SCR1 and\nSCR2, when they become available.\nDISCUSSION\nCD46 was previously shown to be the receptor for the Ed-\nmonston strain of measles virus (15, 50). This paper expands\nupon the results from two other laboratories (30, 47), which\nclaimed that the presence of both the SCR1 and SCR2 do-\nmains of CD46 is suf\ufb01cient for virus binding. We proved that\nthis process occurs via direct interaction of the H protein with\nSCR1 and SCR2 by using a convenient binding assay with Sf9\ninsect cells expressing the viral surface protein, H. 1n our study\nwe were surprised to note that all New World monkeys which\nwere analyzed did not express the SCR1 domain in CD46\nmolecules present on their erythrocytes and lymphocytes. This\nobservation accounted for their inability to bind measles virus\nand hemagglutinate. The SCR1 deletion corresponds to a\nmissing second exon which is not retained in the CD46 mRNA\nduring the processing of precursor RNA; however, the exon\nstill appears to be present in chromosomal DNA (29), which\nimplies some irregularity in the splicing process. The compo-\nsitions of the STP and cytoplasmic domains of CD46 are\nknown to vary through a process of alternate splicing, but\nexons corresponding to the SCR domains have never been\nreported to be deleted through mRNA processing (62, 63, 71).\nNo functional role has yet been assigned to the SCR1 domain\nFIG. 3. Binding assay for mutant CD46 molecules by using insect cells expressing the H protein of measles virus. Mouse OST-7 cells were infected with wild-type\nvaccinia virus (A), vaccinia virus expressing the SCR1 domain, the STP region, and the CD46 transmembrane region (B), a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SCR1,\nSCR2, the STP domain, and the CD46 transmembrane domain (C), or a recombinant virus expressing the entire human CD46 molecule (D). OST-7 cells alone normally\ndo not bind measles virus. Sf9 insect cells infected with a baculovirus expressing measles H protein and b-galactosidase were incubated with Bluogal substrate, washed\nwith PBS, and added to the vaccinia virus-infected cells.

A role in signal transduction has\nrecently been proposed for CD46, and it was shown that in-\nteraction of this receptor with measles virus or monoclonal\nantibodies speci\ufb01c for SCR1 could downregulate the produc-\ntion of interleukin-12 (32). This receptor interaction could\npartially account for the immunosuppressive effects of measles\nvirus. 1t remains to be determined if other cellular factors\nbesides measles virus interact with the SCR1 domain. The\ndeletion of SCR1 in most tissues of New World monkeys (29)\nmay have interesting evolutionary implications in terms of dis-\nease and immune regulation.\nErythrocytes from the baboon Papio cynocephalus have pre-\nviously been reported to hemagglutinate in the presence of\nlaboratory strains of measles virus (57, 59). However, research-\ners showed that many Old World monkey erythrocytes, includ-\ning those from Papio cynocephalus, M. fascicularis, M. mulatta,\nand E. patas, were less ef\ufb01cient in these assays than erythro-\ncytes from the African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops)\n(18\u201320). We con\ufb01rmed this result with two other species of\nbaboon (Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas) and found that\nthis decreased ability to hemagglutinate corresponded to a\nchange at amino acid residue 103, which implicates this region\nof CD46 in measles virus binding. We were able to imitate this\nnatural change through site-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis, and our ex-\nperiments revealed decreased af\ufb01nity for the mutant CD46 in\nan Sf9-H binding assay. The nearby carbohydrate attachment\nsite at Asn114 was also shown to be important for optimal\nbinding, since mutation of this residue to Ala also reduced\ninteraction with Sf9-H cells. 1n addition, the epitope for a\nmonoclonal antibody, M75, was mapped to the same region\n(amino acids 103 to 118) by using immunoblot analysis of our\nmutant CD46 molecules, and it was also shown to inhibit bind-\ning effectively. These preceding studies appear to implicate the\nregion of CD46 consisting of amino acids 103 to 118 as at least\none of the sites involved in virus attachment.\nThe arti\ufb01cial mutation in CD46 which changed GluArg at\npositions 58 and 59 to AlaAla had a dramatic effect on Sf9-H\ncell binding. This is a region which could be involved in elec-\ntrostatic interaction with the binding region of measles virus H\nprotein. Arginine at concentrations of 1 M has previously been\nshown to abrogate virus binding and hemagglutination (37).\nThe region at amino acid 58 or 59 could contribute to salt-\ndependent or charged residue interaction during the attach-\nment process (23, 37, 76). The monoclonal antibody E4.3 has\npreviously been studied in virus attachment experiments (30,\n47). There is some discrepancy between the results from the\ntwo laboratories as to the effectiveness of this antibody in\ninhibiting the binding of H protein to target cells, which could\nbe related to the concentration of the reagent used in their\nexperiments. Our results support those of Manchester et al.\n(47) and con\ufb01rm that E4.3 was indeed a potent inhibitor of\nmeasles virus H protein attachment. We further demonstrated\nthat the epitope for monoclonal antibody E4.3 mapped to a\nregion of CD46 between amino acids 37 and 59 by using im-\nmunoblot analysis of our mutant CD46 molecules. Taken to-\ngether, these data indicate that the region of CD46 consisting\nof amino acids 37 to 59 also participates in binding to the\nmeasles virus H protein.\nThe CD4 binding region (amino acids 39 to 59) which in-\nteracts with human immunode\ufb01ciency virus glycoprotein\n(gp120) has previously been mapped by other investigators\nthrough a series of site-speci\ufb01c mutations and interactions with\nmonoclonal antibodies (5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 31, 48, 60, 72, 79).\nSynthetic peptides were also employed by other laboratories in\nattempts to map binding regions on CD4 but led to contradic-\ntory results (31, 38, 39, 64, 83). Originally we also attempted to\nperform peptide studies with measles virus and CD46 by using\n25-amino-acid peptides derived from all regions of SCR1 and\nSCR2. Peptides at concentrations as high as 200 mM had no\neffect in Sf9-H binding and measles virus infectivity assays. We\npresumed that binding of measles virus depended on confor-\nmational epitopes rather than linear peptide epitopes. Subse-\nquently, a genetic approach using site-speci\ufb01c mutagenesis was\nadopted in our laboratory to map binding regions on CD46. 1nitially we found that large mutagenic changes involving mul-\nTABLE 2.

These mul-\ntiple mutations appeared to perturb binding of Sf9-H cells to\nCD46, no matter which region was targeted. Surface expres-\nsion of the mutated CD46 molecule was not affected, but\nintramolecular disul\ufb01de bond formation may have been al-\ntered. The only area where multiple alanine mutations did not\ndramatically affect binding was the hinge region between SCR1\nand SCR2, indicating that this region was relatively refractile\nto mutagenesis and probably was not important in measles\nvirus binding. Smaller point mutations were subsequently uti-\nlized in our experiments to map regions in SCR1 and SCR2\nwhich are important for measles virus binding.\nA molecular understanding of the exact interaction of mea-\nsles virus H protein with CD46 will ultimately depend upon\nstructural studies using nuclear magnetic resonance or X-ray\ncrystallography to dissect the binding regions of H, SCR1, and\nSCR2. Serum factor H, like CD46, is another complement\nbinding protein which is composed of 20 short consensus re-\ngions. The SCR15 and SCR16 regions of factor H, whose\nthree-dimensional structure has been solved (7), has some\nhomology to the two terminal domains of CD46. The polypep-\ntide backbone for CD46-SCR1 and CD46-SCR2 can be\ncrudely modeled and superimposed on that for the SCR15 and\nSCR16 domains from factor H. However, one can only approx-\nimate regions of interaction between the receptor and viral\nglycoprotein at this time. The \ufb01ne structure of the intramolec-\nular loops de\ufb01ned by the cysteine residues and the orientation\nof the SCR domains about the hinge region between SCR1 and\nSCR2 will likely determine the residues available in the bind-\ning site. Mutagenesis offers some clues as to which residues are\nimportant in virus binding, but these experiments are actually\na lead into structural studies.\nBased on the deletion of SCR1 regions in New World mon-\nkeys, we might predict that marmosets and tamarins from\nSouth America are resistant to infections by the Edmonston\nstrain of measles virus. Studies in our laboratory indicate that\nowl monkey kidney cells (OMK) and marmoset kidney cells\n(NZP-60) also contain this deletion and camot be infected\nwith measles virus in the laboratory (29). However, we and\nothers (33) have infected a marmoset B-cell line which has\nbeen immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus (B95-8), and results\nindicate that these cells contain both the SCR1-deleted and\nnondeleted forms of CD46 (29). Other researchers have re-\nported measles virus infections in cynomolgus monkeys, mar-\nFIG. 4. Effect of CD46 site-speci\ufb01c mutations and monoclonal antibodies directed against SCR1 and SCR2 on binding to insect cells expressing the measles virus\nH protein. Mouse OST-7 cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the mutant CD46 molecules described in Table 2. Sf9 insect cells which\nexpressed both measles virus H protein and b-galactosidase were added to the mouse cells for 1/2 h and subsequently washed with PBS. Binding was quantitated by\na colorimetric assay for b-galactosidase with ONPG as a substrate and was compared to a standard value produced by cells expressing the normal CD46 molecule. This\nbinding relative to that for normal human CD46 is represented on the y axis of the histogram, while the various mutations are listed on the x axis. OST-7 cells infected\nwith wild-type vaccinia virus served as a negative control and exhibited no binding to Sf9-H cells.

The disease\nin moustached marmosets has been reported to be character-\nized by severe gastroenterocolitis and immunosuppression (2),\nwhile the symptoms presented by squirrel monkeys are similar\nto those in humans and consist of a rash, Koplik\u2019s spots, and\ninfection of lymphatic tissue (34). The receptor distribution in\nthese animals is currently under study in our laboratory, and\nthe nature of the SCR1 deletion in different organs of monkeys\nmay determine the tissue tropism and nature of the disease in\nthese animals. Since the SCR1 measles virus binding domain\nappears to be missing in these infected New World monkeys, it\nwill be interesting to determine if another receptor besides\nCD46 can be used by measles virus during the process of\nattachment.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the Amgen DNA sequencing facility and Laarni Antonio\nat Thousand Oaks, Calif., for sequencing the different primate CD46\nclones and mutants.

The bundle-forming pilus (BFP) of EPEC is an established\nvirulence factor encoded on the EPEC adherence factor plasmid (EAF) and has been implicated in both\nlocalized adherence to host cells and bacterial autoaggregation. We investigated the role of BFP in the ability\nof EPEC binding to kill host epithelial cells. BFP-expressing strains killed all three cell lines tested, comprising\nHEp-2 (laryngeal), HeLa (cervical), and Caco-2 (colonic) cells. Analysis of phosphatidylserine expression,\ninternucleosomal cleavage of host cell DNA, and morphological changes detected by electron microscopy\nindicated evidence of apoptosis. The extent of cell death was signi\ufb01cantly greater for BFP-expressing strains,\nincluding E2348/69, a wild-type clinical isolate, as well as for a laboratory strain, HB101, transformed with a\nbfp-carrying plasmid. Strains which did not express BFP induced signi\ufb01cantly less cell death, including a bfpA\ndisruptional mutant of E2348/69, EAF plasmid-cured E2348/69, HB101, and HB101 complemented with the\nlocus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island. These results indicate a direct correlation between BFP\nexpression and induction of cell death, including apoptosis, an event which may involve the targeting of host\ncell membrane phosphatidylethanolamine.\nEnteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) associated with\nsevere infantile diarrhea represents a major health problem\namong infants, particularly in developing countries (37). Re-\nsearch using cultured epithelial cells indicates that EPEC at-\ntaches to host cells initially in a loose manner and then con-\nsolidates attachment in a more intimate manner (17). The\ninitial adherence phenotype, characterized in tissue culture\nassays as localized adherence, is associated with the production\nof plasmid-encoded type 1V \ufb01mbriae known as bundle-forming\npili (BFP) (15, 21). More intimate attachment, characterized\nby the development of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions of\nthe brush border microvilli, is encoded in a chromosomal re-\ngion termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) (32).\nRecent studies with pediatric intestinal biopsy samples have\nminimized the role of BFP in host adhesion and have alterna-\ntively implicated BFP in the formation of bacterial aggregates\nwhich produce the localized adherence pattern typical of\nEPEC infection (25). Nevertheless, studies with volunteers\nwho have ingested BFP-expressing and non-BFP-expressing\nEPEC strains have con\ufb01rmed BFP as a virulence factor (5).\nAttachment of EPEC to the host cell is accompanied by a\nnumber of signal transduction events, including release of ino-\nsitol triphosphate and calcium, phosphorylation of myosin light\nchain, and activation of protein kinase C (10, 18). EPEC also\nsynthesizes and translocates into the host cell a protein known\nas translocated intimin receptor (Tir), which after tyrosine\nphosphorylation permits intimate attachment through the bac-\nterial protein intimin (41). Recently, we and others have re-\nported that EPEC also induces cell death in cultured epithelial\ncells (2, 3, 11). Evidence of both apoptosis and necrosis has\nbeen observed. However, the bacterial structures responsible\nfor the triggering of these cell death pathways have not been\nidenti\ufb01ed. 1n this study, we demonstrate a role for BFP in the\ninduction of cell death, including apoptosis, in host epithelial\ncells.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and cultivation conditions. The characteristics of bacterial\nstrains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The E2348/69 derivatives 31-6-\n1(1),\nJPN\n15,\nand\nE2348/69(pOG127)\nas\nwell\nas\nHB101pMAR7\nand\nHB101(pCVD426) were kindly provided by J. Kaper, University of Maryland.\n31-6-1(1) is a previously described mutant of E2348/69 with a TnphoA insertion\nin the bfpA gene of the pMAR2 (60 MDA virulence plasmid from E2348/69)\nplasmid (14, 15). JPN15 is an E2348/69 derivative cured of plasmid pMAR2\nduring passage through a volunteer (27). The plasmid pOG127 (pMAR2 plasmid\nwith a perA::cat mutation) was transferred to strain JPN15 to generate E2348/\n69(pOG127). Since Per (plasmid-encoded regulator) regulates bfp expression,\nthis strain expresses BFP at lower levels than E2348/69. CVD206 is an eae mutant\nof E2348/69 constructed using a suicide vector with a pir-dependent R6K repli-\ncon and the sacB gene of Bacillus subtilis (16). HB101(pMAR7) is an avirulent\nlaboratory strain, HB101, complemented with pMAR7 plasmid (an ampicillin-\nresistant derivative of the EPEC adherence factor [EAF] plasmid) which con-\ntains the bfp gene (23). HB101(pCVD426) is complemented with pCVD426\ngenerated by cloning the entire LEE region from E2348/69 into the cosmid\nvector pCVD551 (33). Bacteria were stored in tryptic soy broth containing 20%\n(vol/vol) glycerol at \u000270\u00b0C. Prior to use, bacteria were cultured on Trypticase soy\nagar with 5% de\ufb01brinated sheep blood supplemented with the appropriate an-\n* Corresponding author.

Bacterial expression of BFP was assessed by\nWestern blotting using a polyclonal anti-BFP antiserum (generous gift of J.\nGiron, Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico) as previously de-\nscribed (21). After overnight growth, the bacteria were harvested, washed once\nwith antibiotic-free cell culture medium, and resuspended in the epithelial cell\nculture medium as indicated below.\nCell culture. The human epithelial cells HEp-2 (human laryngeal cell line),\nHeLa (human cervical cell line), and Caco-2 (human colonic cell line) were\nobtained from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. HEp-2 and\nHeLa cells were grown in minimum essential medium (Gibco Laboratories,\nGrand 1sland, N.Y.) supplemented with decomplemented 10% fetal calf serum\n(Cansera 1nternational 1nc.), 0.5% L-glutamine (ICN Biomedicals 1nc., Costa\nMesa, Calif.), 0.1% sodium bicarbonate (ICN), and 0.1% gentamycin at 37\u00b0C in\n5% CO2. The human colonic Caco-2 cells were grown in minimum essential\nmedium with Earl\u2019s salts (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 0.5% L-glutamine,\nnonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.1% gentamycin (Gibco\nBRL) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.\nAssessment of outer lea\ufb02et levels of PS. The level of outer lea\ufb02et phosphati-\ndylserine (PS) on cells incubated with media or bacteria was determined by \ufb02ow\ncytometry following treatment with \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated an-\nnexin V (annexin V-FITC; Pharmingen 1nternational, Mississauga, Ontario,\nCanada) according to the method of Vermes et al. (44). Approximately 106 cells\n(70% con\ufb02uent monolayer) were infected with 108 bacteria in culture medium\nwithout antibiotics for 5 to 18 h at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. After incubation,\nboth detached (supernatant) and adherent (trypsinized) cells were harvested and\nthe nonadherent bacteria were removed by centrifugation (260 \u0003 g for 10 min at\n4\u00b0C) after mixing with isotonic solution of 15% sucrose in phosphate-buffered\nsaline. The pellets were then resuspended in 100 \u0004l of binding buffer (10 mM\nHEPES, 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4), and thereafter 5 \u0004l of\nannexin V-FITC (Pharmingen) was added to each tube. The samples were then\nincubated at room temperature for 20 to 30 min, mixed with 400 \u0004l of binding\nbuffer, screened, and supplemented with 0.5 \u0004g of propidium iodide (PI)\n(Pharmingen) prior to \ufb02ow cytometric analysis. An increase in outer lea\ufb02et PS,\ndetected by annexin V-FITC, provides an indication of apoptosis and necrosis.\nCells which are late apoptotic or necrotic lose membrane integrity and will stain\nwith both annexin V-FITC and PI. Cells which retain membrane integrity, in-\ncluding viable and early apoptotic cells, will not take up PI. Therefore, the\ncombined use of annexin V-FITC and PI can distinguish between early apoptotic\nand late apoptotic or necrotic cells (24). To assess the effect of anti-BFP on\nEPEC induction of cell death, E2348/69 was preincubated with equivalent con-\ncentrations of either rabbit anti-BFP or rabbit nonimmune serum for 45 min at\nroom temperature followed by incubation with HEp-2 cells per the standard\nprotocol. Cell death was analyzed by \ufb02ow cytometry as described above.\nElectron microscopic analysis of cell death. Cell death was analyzed by elec-\ntron microscopy as previously described (3). Subcon\ufb02uent monolayers of all\nthree cell lines were incubated with media or bacteria (108) for 5 h and were then\nanalyzed by electron microscopy for morphological changes indicative of necrosis\nor apoptosis. Verotoxin 1 (VT1) treatment was used as a control for induction of\napoptosis. Cells which express outer lea\ufb02et Gb3 have been shown to be sensitive\nto VT-induced apoptosis (28, 43). 1n all cases, trypsinized cell monolayers and\ndetached cells (supernatant) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline,\ngently overlayed with 1 ml of universal \ufb01xative (equal parts of formaldehyde and\n1% glutaraldehyde), and post\ufb01xed in 2% osmium tetroxide. Dehydration was\ncarried out in graded ethanol, followed by propylene oxide and embedding in\nEpon. One-micrometer-thick sections were stained with toluidine blue and lead\ncitrate. Electron microscopic examination was conducted using a Philips 201\n(N. V. Philips, Gloeilampenfabrieken, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) transmis-\nsion electron microscope.\nAnalysis of internucleosomal fragmentation. Analysis of DNA fragmentation\nwas carried out as previously described (3). Briefy, all trypsinized cells and those\nfrom supernatants were harvested by centrifugation and gently lysed with hypo-\ntonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100) on ice\nfor 10 min. After 10 min of centrifugation at 13,700 \u0003 g and 4\u00b0C, the superna-\ntants were mixed well with an equal volume of 1:1 phenol-chloroform and\nrecentrifuged. After transfer, the upper phases containing DNA were incubated\nwith 1 \u0004g of glycogen, and a 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and 1 ml of\nabsolute ethanol were added and incubated at \u000220\u00b0C overnight. The DNA was\npelleted by centrifugation (14,000 \u0003 g for 20 min) at 4\u00b0C, washed once with 70%\nethanol, and air dried at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA pellets were\ndissolved in 10 \u0004l of Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA),\nmixed with 12 \u0004l of RNase (20 \u0004g/ml in Tris-EDTA), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for\n30 min. Samples were incubated with 3 \u0004l of loading buffer (50 mM EDTA, 15%\n[wt/vol] Ficoll, 0.25% [wt/vol] bromophenol blue) at 65\u00b0C for 15 min and elec-\ntrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel at 50 V for 90 min.\nBacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. Bacterial binding to epithelial cells was\nassayed as previously described (3). Approximately 108 bacteria were incubated\nwith 106 cells (70 to 80% con\ufb02uent monolayer) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. After incubation\nwith bacteria, both detached and adherent (trypsinized) cells were harvested and\nseparated from nonadherent bacteria by centrifugation through an isotonic 15%\nsucrose solution. Bacterial binding was detected using a polyclonal anti-E. coli\n(all antigens) antibody (Virostat) and a goat anti-rabbit\u2013FITC conjugate (Sigma)\nand quanti\ufb01ed by \ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using a Becton\nDickinson FACSscan \ufb02ow cytometer. All samples were analyzed with Cell Quest\nsoftware. Histogram plots showing cell count versus \ufb02uorescence intensity are\nprovided.\nRESULTS\nEffect of BFP expression on host cell morphology. Electron\nmicroscopic analysis of epithelial cell morphology indicated a\ncorrelation between BFP expression and the extent of apopto-\nsis and necrosis. Western blot analysis con\ufb01rmed expression of\nBFP for all bfp-positive strains and lack of expression for all\nbfp-negative strains (data not shown). Evidence of apoptosis\nincluded membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and mar-\ngination. Necrotic cells, on the other hand, were typically\nlarger and lighter, with plasma membrane lesions and mito-\nchondrial abnormalities. For both HeLa (Fig. 1) and Caco-2\n(Fig. 2) cells, all BFP-expressing strains, including E2348/69,\nHB101(pMAR7), and E2348/69(pOG127), induced consis-\ntently signi\ufb01cantly higher levels of apoptosis and necrosis than\nthose produced by incubation with the corresponding BFP-\nnegative strains, 31-6-1(1), HB101, and JPN15, respectively\n(P \u0005 0.05). Even CVD206, which expresses BFP but not in-\ntimin, triggered higher levels of cell death than did the BFP-\nnegative strains, although the levels were somewhat lower than\nTABLE 1.

Untreated cells\nshowed less than 5% apoptosis and necrosis combined (not\nshown). Overnight treatment of HeLa cells with VT1 induced\nlevels of cell death similar to those for the BFP-expressing\nstrains. Caco-2 cells, which have been reported to express\nlower levels of plasma membrane VT receptor (28) and should\ntherefore be less sensitive to VT1 treatment, showed lower\nlevels of cell death in response to overnight VT1 treatment.\nHeLa cells express higher levels of membrane VT receptor\n(26) and were indeed more sensitive to VT-induced cell death.\nEffect of BFP expression on host cell outer lea\ufb02et PS. Flow\ncytometric analysis of three cell lines infected with various E.\ncoli strains resulted in increased outer lea\ufb02et PS levels after\ntreatment with any of the BFP-expressing strains tested. Figure\n3 shows the histogram plots of annexin V-FITC staining (to\ndetect outer lea\ufb02et PS) for HEp-2, Caco-2, and HeLa cells\ntreated with BFP-positive strains and the corresponding BFP-\nnegative strains. 1n each case, treatment with the BFP-express-\ning strains [E2348/69, E2348/69(pOG127), and HB101(pMAR7)]\nresulted in elevated outer lea\ufb02et PS levels compared to treat-\nment with the non-BFP-expressing strains [31-6-1(1), JPN15,\nand HB101]. HB101(pCVD426), which expresses the intimin\nadhesin but not BFP, showed PS levels identical to those for\nHB101 (see Fig. 7). Treatment with sterile \ufb01ltered superna-\ntants resulted in PS levels similar to those of untreated cells\n(not shown). Preincubation of EPEC with anti-BFP reduced\nthe level of cell death relative to controls with either no anti-\nserum or equivalent concentrations of rabbit nonimmune se-\nrum (Table 2). At a concentration of 0.89 mg of anti-BFP per\nml, cell viability was increased to 65%, over that with no anti-\nserum (43%) or rabbit nonimmune serum (50%).\nEffect of BFP expression on DNA fragmentation. Agarose\ngel electrophoresis of cellular DNA showed evidence of inter-\nnucleosomal DNA fragmentation in all cell lines infected with\nthe BFP-expressing strains E2348/69, HB101(pMAR7), and\nE2348/69(pOG127). Figure 4 shows the electrophoretic result\nof extracted DNA from HeLa cells and clearly indicates DNA\ndegradation after a 5-h incubation with HB101(pMAR7),\nE2348/69(pOG127), and E2348/69 and overnight treatment\nwith VT1. Some DNA degradation was also observed with\nCVD206. No such degradation was observed when HeLa cells\nwere untreated or incubated with HB101, JPN15, or 31-6-1(1).\nSimilar results were achieved using Caco-2 and HEp-2 cells\n(not shown). These DNA patterns, although not the typical\nladders generated by other apoptosis-inducing agents, are con-\nsistent with those reported for other apoptosis-inducing bac-\nteria (11) and likely represent the mixed apoptosis-necrosis\nindicated by the electron microscope and \ufb02ow cytometry re-\nsults in this study. Furthermore, others have reported that\ncleavage of internucleosomal DNA in epithelial cells may be\ndefective, resulting in less distinctive DNA fragmentation pat-\nterns (38).\nRelative contributions of bfp and eae. 1n order to assess the\nrelative contributions of bfp and eae genes to cell death, we\ncompared treatment with wild-type EPEC E2348/69 and the\neae-negative mutant and bfp-negative mutant of E2348/69 and\nassessed by \ufb02ow cytometry the extent of apoptotic and necrotic\ncell death. Figure 5 shows the dot plots for four treatments of\nHeLa cells, comparing the intensity of annexin V-FITC stain-\ning with PI staining. Lower left quadrants re\ufb02ect percentages\nof viable cells (nonapoptotic, nonnecrotic cells; i.e., low levels\nof both annexin-FITC and PI). Lower right quadrants indicate\nFIG. 1.

The\nlevel of late apoptosis or necrosis was also diminished with the\nbfp-negative mutant. Disruption of the eae gene in CVD206\nresulted in levels of early apoptosis similar to that for the wild\ntype, E2348/69, but with markedly less necrosis and late apo-\nptosis. This result suggests that BFP may be important in the\ninduction of apoptosis while intimin may play a more signi\ufb01-\ncant role in the induction of necrosis. Certainly, the reduction\nof early apoptosis to background levels with the bfp mutant and\nthe maintenance of wild-type levels of early apoptosis with the\neae mutant support the involvement of BFP but not intimin in\nthe induction of apoptosis. Since the upper quadrant likely\nincludes cells which have undergone apoptosis and eventually\nlost membrane integrity as well as those cells which have pro-\nceeded through a necrotic pathway, it is not possible to de\ufb01n-\nitively assign apoptosis and necrosis induction roles.\nBacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. Consistent with previ-\nous reports, BFP expression correlated with adhesion to cul-\ntured epithelial cells (Fig. 6). BFP-expressing strains generally\nadhered better to both HeLa (shown) and Caco-2 (not shown)\ncells than did the non-BFP-expressing correlates. HB101\n(pMAR7) adhered better to HeLa cells than did HB101\n(pCVD426) (Fig. 6D), which adhered only slightly better than\nHB101, but only HB101(pMAR7) was capable of inducing\nsigni\ufb01cant levels of cell death (Fig. 7).\nDISCUSSION\nBacterial colonization and infection of various tissues is the\nresult of recognition by bacterial adhesins of speci\ufb01c receptors\non the target tissue. Once the microorganism approaches the\nhost cell surface, it is essential for the pathogen to use its full\ngenetic potential for attachment and the synthesis of other\ntraits to secure a speci\ufb01c niche within the host that will permit\nits replication and survival. Accordingly, the induction of host\ncell death may represent a strategy developed by microorgan-\nisms to ensure their survival, infection, and invasion of the\ntarget tissue. 1nduction of host cell death has been reported for several\ngastrointestinal pathogens, including Yersinia (34), Salmonella\n(35), Shigella (47, 48), Helicobacter pylori (36), and enterohe-\nmorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (3). EPEC infection has been re-\nported to cause pathological damage of the target tissue; how-\never, features of apoptotic cell death were not indicated (20,\n42). Evidence of EPEC-induced apoptotic and necrotic cell\ndeath has been reported for cell lines including HEp-2, T84,\nCaco-2, and HeLa cells (3, 11).\nOur investigation of the cell death triggered by E. coli strains\nindicates a role for BFP in the induction of apoptosis. Flow\ncytometric analysis showed that the epithelial cell apoptosis\nwas much greater with any of the BFP-expressing E. coli strains\nFIG. 2.

Using PS exposure as a\nmarker of apoptosis, we tested treatment of HEp-2, Caco-2,\nand HeLa cells with various BPF\u0001 and BFP\u0002 strains. 1n all\ncases, the BFP-expressing strains induced elevated levels of\napoptosis over their non-BFP-expressing correlates. 1nterest-\ningly, HEp-2 and HeLa cells showed signi\ufb01cant induction of\napoptosis after incubation with HB101(pMAR7) in contrast to\nother BFP\u0001 strains. This may be a consequence of interference\nby lipopolysaccharide or type 1 \ufb01mbriae expressed by wild-type\nE2348/69 and E2348/69(pOG127) strains but not by HB101.\nThis is consistent with other reports that lipopolysaccharide\nFIG. 3.

Treat-\nment with sterile \ufb01ltered supernatants resulted in background\nlevels of cell death (5%) found in untreated cells. 1n all cases,\nBFP-expressing strains induced signi\ufb01cantly higher levels of\ncell death and showed higher levels of adhesion to the same\ncell lines. Levels of adhesion were consistent with the ability to\ninduce apoptosis with HB101(pMAR7)- and E2348/69-in-\nfected cells showing the highest levels of both adhesion and\napoptosis. The absence of the BFP adhesion appeared to have\na more profound effect on induction of cell death than did the\nabsence of other adhesins such as intimin (in strain CVD206).\nPreincubation with anti-BFP at concentrations which have\nbeen shown to reduce EPEC adhesion (21) was also found to\ninhibit EPEC induction of cell death.\nAnalysis of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation con\ufb01rmed\nthe induction of apoptosis by the BFP-expressing strains. Elec-\ntron microscopic analysis of Caco-2 and HeLa cell lines incu-\nbated with BFP-expressing E. coli strains also shows a clear\nincrease in both apoptotic and necrotic cells in contrast to the\nBFP-negative strains.\nThrough a double labeling experiment with annexin V-FITC\nand PI, we were able to distinguish between early apoptotic\nand late apoptotic or necrotic cells. 1n this analysis, HeLa cells\ntreated\nwith\nE2348/69,\n31-6-1(1),\nand\nthe\neae-de\ufb01cient\nCVD206 strain revealed that the eae mutant strain induced\nhigher levels of apoptosis and less necrosis than the wild-type\nparent strain. This has also been observed with the T84 cell line\n(data not shown). Ablation of the bfp gene in strain 31-6-1(1),\nwhich still expresses intimin, reduced the level of early apo-\nptotic cells to that of untreated cells. However, as we have\npreviously noted, the detection of necrosis in vitro may not be\nphysiological, since nonphagocytosed apoptotic cells may even-\ntually lose their membrane intregrity and appear necrotic (3).\nConsequently, while we note differences in the relative levels of\napoptosis and necrosis, we have focused primarily on the ex-\ntent of apoptosis triggered by bacterial binding.\nA recent study has implicated the secreted virulence factor\nEspF in host cell death triggered by EPEC (12). 1n this study,\nan espF mutant was attenuated in its ability to induce host cell\ndeath as measured by uptake of ethidium homodimer. Addi-\ntional experiments showed that COS and HeLa cells trans-\nfected with espF appeared to undergo apoptotic cell death as\ndetermined by morphological changes. While the experiments\ndemonstrate a role for EspF as a cell death factor, the authors\nconclude that EspF cannot completely account for the host cell\nkilling by EPEC. They note that the cell killing ability of the\nespF mutant was reduced but not entirely lost. 1t should also be\nnoted that the extent of cell death in the espF-transfected cells\nFIG. 4.

We have\npreviously demonstrated using thin-layer chromatography and\nliposome assays that EPEC recognizes phosphatidylethano-\nlamine (PE) in a speci\ufb01c and dose-dependent manner and that\nadhesion to human epithelial cells is inhibitable by anti-PE (4).\nWe have also found that BFP expression correlates with PE\nrecognition (28a), which when considered together with the\npresent \ufb01ndings suggests that bacterial binding to host mem-\nbrane PE may play a role in the induction of apoptosis. All cell\nlines tested in this study expressed PE. Variations in the level\nof plasma membrane outer lea\ufb02et PE may explain differences\nin the extent of apoptosis induced in different cell lines. We\nhave shown that augmentation of outer lea\ufb02et PE levels\nthrough PE-liposome uptake by epithelial cells does increase\nbacterial binding, which in turn increases exposure of the ap-\noptotic marker PS (3).\nThe ligation of membrane PE by BFP-expressing EPEC may\ntrigger downstream events involving key mediators of apopto-\nsis, including ceramide. Ceramide levels may be increased\nthrough the inhibition of ceramide acylation. A phospholipase\nA2-like transacylase transfers an acyl group from PE to cer-\namide (1). Therefore, bacterial binding to host PE receptors\nmay reduce the PE pool, restrict this reaction, and elevate\nceramide levels. PE is also a substrate of phospholipase D,\nwhich catalyzes the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA) (29,\n45) which plays a pivotal role in the balance of mitogenic and\napoptotic responses. Sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phos-\nphate increase intracellular levels of PA, thereby stimulating\nmitogenesis, while ceramide inhibits phospholipase D activa-\ntion, thereby decreasing PA levels and enhancing the apoptotic\nresponse (22). The selective ligation of membrane PE by BFP-\nexpressing EPEC could reduce the availability of PE for phos-\npholipase D-mediated hydrolysis, resulting in reduced levels of\ncytosolic PA and disrupting the mitogen signaling cascade.\nBacterial induction of apoptosis could lead to a further reduc-\ntion in cytosolic exposure of PE, thereby enhancing this effect.\nBFP binding to host membrane PE may also contribute to\nmembrane events associated with apoptosis. PE is a nonbilayer\nphospholipid which has a high tendency to form the HII in-\nverted micelle phase (7, 13). Therefore, PE-rich membranes\ntend to exert bending \ufb02uctuations (8) and therefore to pro-\nmote physical membrane changes, including membrane fusion,\ninward membrane bending, and membrane budding. These\nchanges may affect membrane permeability, endocytosis, cell\ndivision, and cell budding associated with the formation of\napoptotic bodies. The importance of membrane PE is empha-\nsized by \ufb01ndings which show that lowering the PE content\ndiminished cell death during simulated ischemia and reperfu-\nsion (40). Therefore, events which sequester membrane PE,\nincluding bacterial binding, may contribute to apoptotic mem-\nbrane changes. Further study is required to determine the\nmechanism by which bacterial ligation of host cell PE contrib-\nutes to the induction of host cell death.\nWe have also reported that EHEC, another A/E gastroin-\ntestinal pathogen, binds PE and that EHEC binding to two\nepithelial cell lines correlates with plasma membrane outer\nlea\ufb02et levels of PE (4). Furthermore, EHEC, in a similar\nmanner to EPEC, induces apoptosis in a number of epithelial\ncell lines, which results in increased outer lea\ufb02et PE and bac-\nterial binding (3). The mechanism by which EHEC induces\napoptosis is unknown. 1t may be that EHEC also expresses a\nBFP-like pilus which may mediate host cell PE binding and\napoptosis. 1nterestingly, a mutation in the ler (LEE-encoded\nregulator) gene of EHEC resulted in the expression of an\nunidenti\ufb01ed pilus and also enhanced epithelial cell adhesion\n(19). 1n conclusion, these results clearly indicate a direct correla-\ntion between BFP expression and the induction of host cell\ndeath including apoptosis. BFP, an established EPEC viru-\nlence factor, has been previously implicated in initial host cell\nattachment and in bacterial autoaggregation. These \ufb01ndings\nnow de\ufb01ne another role for BFP in the pathogenesis of EPEC\ninfection. Our earlier work has proposed that the induction of\napoptosis by EPEC and EHEC provides a bacterial advantage\nby augmenting outer lea\ufb02et levels of the PE receptor candidate\n(3). Although apoptotic cells are eventually phagocytosed in\nvivo, receptor ampli\ufb01cation through apoptosis can offer a tem-\nporary adhesion advantage to the bacterium. Other advantages\nmay include enhanced access to nutrients and to the subepi-\nthelial layer. 1t has been suggested that apoptosis of epithelial\ncells triggered by Pseudomonas aeruginosa may serve as a ve-\nhicle for clearance and bacterial dissemination (39, 46). Alter-\nnatively, cell death may function as a host mechanism to limit\nbacterial infection. EPEC also stimulates a number of anti-\napoptotic pathways within the cell and it has been suggested\nthat EPEC has developed strategies to slow host cell killing\n(10). 1t may be that the coordination of these apoptotic and\nantiapoptotic signaling events in the host cell by the bacterium\nultimately determines the infection outcome.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by grants from the Crohn\u2019s and Colitis\nFoundation of Canada (to D.E.B.F.) and the Medical Research Coun-\ncil of Canada (MT 13073) (to C.A.L.).\nREFERENCES\n1.

The bundle-forming pilus (BFP) of EPEC is an established\nvirulence factor encoded on the EPEC adherence factor plasmid (EAF) and has been implicated in both\nlocalized adherence to host cells and bacterial autoaggregation. We investigated the role of BFP in the ability\nof EPEC binding to kill host epithelial cells.

Analysis of phosphatidylserine expression,\ninternucleosomal cleavage of host cell DNA, and morphological changes detected by electron microscopy\nindicated evidence of apoptosis. The extent of cell death was signi\ufb01cantly greater for BFP-expressing strains,\nincluding E2348/69, a wild-type clinical isolate, as well as for a laboratory strain, HB101, transformed with a\nbfp-carrying plasmid. Strains which did not express BFP induced signi\ufb01cantly less cell death, including a bfpA\ndisruptional mutant of E2348/69, EAF plasmid-cured E2348/69, HB101, and HB101 complemented with the\nlocus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island. These results indicate a direct correlation between BFP\nexpression and induction of cell death, including apoptosis, an event which may involve the targeting of host\ncell membrane phosphatidylethanolamine.\nEnteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) associated with\nsevere infantile diarrhea represents a major health problem\namong infants, particularly in developing countries (37). Re-\nsearch using cultured epithelial cells indicates that EPEC at-\ntaches to host cells initially in a loose mamer and then con-\nsolidates attachment in a more intimate mamer (17). The\ninitial adherence phenotype, characterized in tissue culture\nassays as localized adherence, is associated with the production\nof plasmid-encoded type IV \ufb01mbriae known as bundle-forming\npili (BFP) (15, 21). More intimate attachment, characterized\nby the development of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions of\nthe brush border microvilli, is encoded in a chromosomal re-\ngion termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) (32).\nRecent studies with pediatric intestinal biopsy samples have\nminimized the role of BFP in host adhesion and have alterna-\ntively implicated BFP in the formation of bacterial aggregates\nwhich produce the localized adherence pattern typical of\nEPEC infection (25). Nevertheless, studies with volunteers\nwho have ingested BFP-expressing and non-BFP-expressing\nEPEC strains have con\ufb01rmed BFP as a virulence factor (5).\nAttachment of EPEC to the host cell is accompanied by a\nnumber of signal transduction events, including release of ino-\nsitol triphosphate and calcium, phosphorylation of myosin light\nchain, and activation of protein kinase C (10, 18). EPEC also\nsynthesizes and translocates into the host cell a protein known\nas translocated intimin receptor (Tir), which after tyrosine\nphosphorylation permits intimate attachment through the bac-\nterial protein intimin (41). Recently, we and others have re-\nported that EPEC also induces cell death in cultured epithelial\ncells (2, 3, 11). Evidence of both apoptosis and necrosis has\nbeen observed. However, the bacterial structures responsible\nfor the triggering of these cell death pathways have not been\nidenti\ufb01ed. In this study, we demonstrate a role for BFP in the\ninduction of cell death, including apoptosis, in host epithelial\ncells.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and cultivation conditions. The characteristics of bacterial\nstrains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The E2348/69 derivatives 31-6-\n1(1),\nJPN\n15,\nand\nE2348/69(pOG127)\nas\nwell\nas\nHB101pMAR7\nand\nHB101(pCVD426) were kindly provided by J. Kaper, University of Maryland.\n31-6-1(1) is a previously described mutant of E2348/69 with a TnphoA insertion\nin the bfpA gene of the pMAR2 (60 MDA virulence plasmid from E2348/69)\nplasmid (14, 15). JPN15 is an E2348/69 derivative cured of plasmid pMAR2\nduring passage through a volunteer (27). The plasmid pOG127 (pMAR2 plasmid\nwith a perA::cat mutation) was transferred to strain JPN15 to generate E2348/\n69(pOG127). Since Per (plasmid-encoded regulator) regulates bfp expression,\nthis strain expresses BFP at lower levels than E2348/69. CVD206 is an eae mutant\nof E2348/69 constructed using a suicide vector with a pir-dependent R6K repli-\ncon and the sacB gene of Bacillus subtilis (16). HB101(pMAR7) is an avirulent\nlaboratory strain, HB101, complemented with pMAR7 plasmid (an ampicillin-\nresistant derivative of the EPEC adherence factor [EAF] plasmid) which con-\ntains the bfp gene (23). HB101(pCVD426) is complemented with pCVD426\ngenerated by cloning the entire LEE region from E2348/69 into the cosmid\nvector pCVD551 (33). Bacteria were stored in tryptic soy broth containing 20%\n(vol/vol) glycerol at \u000270\u00b0C. Prior to use, bacteria were cultured on Trypticase soy\nagar with 5% de\ufb01brinated sheep blood supplemented with the appropriate an-\n* Corresponding author.

Bacterial expression of BFP was assessed by\nWestern blotting using a polyclonal anti-BFP antiserum (generous gift of J.\nGiron, Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico) as previously de-\nscribed (21). After overnight growth, the bacteria were harvested, washed once\nwith antibiotic-free cell culture medium, and resuspended in the epithelial cell\nculture medium as indicated below.\nCell culture. The human epithelial cells HEp-2 (human laryngeal cell line),\nHeLa (human cervical cell line), and Caco-2 (human colonic cell line) were\nobtained from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. HEp-2 and\nHeLa cells were grown in minimum essential medium (Gibco Laboratories,\nGrand Island, N.Y.) supplemented with decomplemented 10% fetal calf serum\n(Cansera International Inc.), 0.5% L-glutamine (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa\nMesa, Calif.), 0.1% sodium bicarbonate (ICN), and 0.1% gentamycin at 37\u00b0C in\n5% CO2. The human colonic Caco-2 cells were grown in minimum essential\nmedium with Earl\u2019s salts (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 0.5% L-glutamine,\nnonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.1% gentamycin (Gibco\nBRL) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.\nAssessment of outer lea\ufb02et levels of PS. The level of outer lea\ufb02et phosphati-\ndylserine (PS) on cells incubated with media or bacteria was determined by \ufb02ow\ncytometry following treatment with \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated an-\nnexin V (amexin V-FITC; Pharmingen International, Mississauga, Ontario,\nCanada) according to the method of Vermes et al. (44). Approximately 106 cells\n(70% con\ufb02uent monolayer) were infected with 108 bacteria in culture medium\nwithout antibiotics for 5 to 18 h at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. After incubation,\nboth detached (supernatant) and adherent (trypsinized) cells were harvested and\nthe nonadherent bacteria were removed by centrifugation (260 \u0003 g for 10 min at\n4\u00b0C) after mixing with isotonic solution of 15% sucrose in phosphate-buffered\nsaline. The pellets were then resuspended in 100 \u0004l of binding buffer (10 mM\nHEPES, 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4), and thereafter 5 \u0004l of\namexin V-FITC (Pharmingen) was added to each tube. The samples were then\nincubated at room temperature for 20 to 30 min, mixed with 400 \u0004l of binding\nbuffer, screened, and supplemented with 0.5 \u0004g of propidium iodide (PI)\n(Pharmingen) prior to \ufb02ow cytometric analysis. An increase in outer lea\ufb02et PS,\ndetected by amexin V-FITC, provides an indication of apoptosis and necrosis.\nCells which are late apoptotic or necrotic lose membrane integrity and will stain\nwith both amexin V-FITC and PI. Cells which retain membrane integrity, in-\ncluding viable and early apoptotic cells, will not take up PI. Therefore, the\ncombined use of amexin V-FITC and PI can distinguish between early apoptotic\nand late apoptotic or necrotic cells (24). To assess the effect of anti-BFP on\nEPEC induction of cell death, E2348/69 was preincubated with equivalent con-\ncentrations of either rabbit anti-BFP or rabbit nonimmune serum for 45 min at\nroom temperature followed by incubation with HEp-2 cells per the standard\nprotocol. Cell death was analyzed by \ufb02ow cytometry as described above.\nElectron microscopic analysis of cell death. Cell death was analyzed by elec-\ntron microscopy as previously described (3). Subcon\ufb02uent monolayers of all\nthree cell lines were incubated with media or bacteria (108) for 5 h and were then\nanalyzed by electron microscopy for morphological changes indicative of necrosis\nor apoptosis. Verotoxin 1 (VT1) treatment was used as a control for induction of\napoptosis. Cells which express outer lea\ufb02et Gb3 have been shown to be sensitive\nto VT-induced apoptosis (28, 43). In all cases, trypsinized cell monolayers and\ndetached cells (supernatant) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline,\ngently overlayed with 1 ml of universal \ufb01xative (equal parts of formaldehyde and\n1% glutaraldehyde), and post\ufb01xed in 2% osmium tetroxide. Dehydration was\ncarried out in graded ethanol, followed by propylene oxide and embedding in\nEpon. One-micrometer-thick sections were stained with toluidine blue and lead\ncitrate. Electron microscopic examination was conducted using a Philips 201\n(N. V. Philips, Gloeilampenfabrieken, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) transmis-\nsion electron microscope.\nAnalysis of internucleosomal fragmentation. Analysis of DNA fragmentation\nwas carried out as previously described (3). Briefy, all trypsinized cells and those\nfrom supernatants were harvested by centrifugation and gently lysed with hypo-\ntonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100) on ice\nfor 10 min. After 10 min of centrifugation at 13,700 \u0003 g and 4\u00b0C, the superna-\ntants were mixed well with an equal volume of 1:1 phenol-chloroform and\nrecentrifuged. After transfer, the upper phases containing DNA were incubated\nwith 1 \u0004g of glycogen, and a 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and 1 ml of\nabsolute ethanol were added and incubated at \u000220\u00b0C overnight. The DNA was\npelleted by centrifugation (14,000 \u0003 g for 20 min) at 4\u00b0C, washed once with 70%\nethanol, and air dried at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA pellets were\ndissolved in 10 \u0004l of Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA),\nmixed with 12 \u0004l of RNase (20 \u0004g/ml in Tris-EDTA), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for\n30 min. Samples were incubated with 3 \u0004l of loading buffer (50 mM EDTA, 15%\n[wt/vol] Ficoll, 0.25% [wt/vol] bromophenol blue) at 65\u00b0C for 15 min and elec-\ntrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel at 50 V for 90 min.\nBacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. Bacterial binding to epithelial cells was\nassayed as previously described (3). Approximately 108 bacteria were incubated\nwith 106 cells (70 to 80% con\ufb02uent monolayer) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. After incubation\nwith bacteria, both detached and adherent (trypsinized) cells were harvested and\nseparated from nonadherent bacteria by centrifugation through an isotonic 15%\nsucrose solution. Bacterial binding was detected using a polyclonal anti-E. coli\n(all antigens) antibody (Virostat) and a goat anti-rabbit\u2013FITC conjugate (Sigma)\nand quanti\ufb01ed by \ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using a Becton\nDickinson FACSscan \ufb02ow cytometer. All samples were analyzed with Cell Quest\nsoftware. Histogram plots showing cell count versus \ufb02uorescence intensity are\nprovided.\nRESULTS\nEffect of BFP expression on host cell morphology. Electron\nmicroscopic analysis of epithelial cell morphology indicated a\ncorrelation between BFP expression and the extent of apopto-\nsis and necrosis. Western blot analysis con\ufb01rmed expression of\nBFP for all bfp-positive strains and lack of expression for all\nbfp-negative strains (data not shown). Evidence of apoptosis\nincluded membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and mar-\ngination. Necrotic cells, on the other hand, were typically\nlarger and lighter, with plasma membrane lesions and mito-\nchondrial abnormalities. For both HeLa (Fig. 1) and Caco-2\n(Fig. 2) cells, all BFP-expressing strains, including E2348/69,\nHB101(pMAR7), and E2348/69(pOG127), induced consis-\ntently signi\ufb01cantly higher levels of apoptosis and necrosis than\nthose produced by incubation with the corresponding BFP-\nnegative strains, 31-6-1(1), HB101, and JPN15, respectively\n(P \u0005 0.05). Even CVD206, which expresses BFP but not in-\ntimin, triggered higher levels of cell death than did the BFP-\nnegative strains, although the levels were somewhat lower than\nTABLE 1.

Untreated cells\nshowed less than 5% apoptosis and necrosis combined (not\nshown). Overnight treatment of HeLa cells with VT1 induced\nlevels of cell death similar to those for the BFP-expressing\nstrains. Caco-2 cells, which have been reported to express\nlower levels of plasma membrane VT receptor (28) and should\ntherefore be less sensitive to VT1 treatment, showed lower\nlevels of cell death in response to overnight VT1 treatment.\nHeLa cells express higher levels of membrane VT receptor\n(26) and were indeed more sensitive to VT-induced cell death.\nEffect of BFP expression on host cell outer lea\ufb02et PS. Flow\ncytometric analysis of three cell lines infected with various E.\ncoli strains resulted in increased outer lea\ufb02et PS levels after\ntreatment with any of the BFP-expressing strains tested. Figure\n3 shows the histogram plots of amexin V-FITC staining (to\ndetect outer lea\ufb02et PS) for HEp-2, Caco-2, and HeLa cells\ntreated with BFP-positive strains and the corresponding BFP-\nnegative strains. In each case, treatment with the BFP-express-\ning strains [E2348/69, E2348/69(pOG127), and HB101(pMAR7)]\nresulted in elevated outer lea\ufb02et PS levels compared to treat-\nment with the non-BFP-expressing strains [31-6-1(1), JPN15,\nand HB101]. HB101(pCVD426), which expresses the intimin\nadhesin but not BFP, showed PS levels identical to those for\nHB101 (see Fig. 7). Treatment with sterile \ufb01ltered superna-\ntants resulted in PS levels similar to those of untreated cells\n(not shown). Preincubation of EPEC with anti-BFP reduced\nthe level of cell death relative to controls with either no anti-\nserum or equivalent concentrations of rabbit nonimmune se-\nrum (Table 2). At a concentration of 0.89 mg of anti-BFP per\nml, cell viability was increased to 65%, over that with no anti-\nserum (43%) or rabbit nonimmune serum (50%).\nEffect of BFP expression on DNA fragmentation. Agarose\ngel electrophoresis of cellular DNA showed evidence of inter-\nnucleosomal DNA fragmentation in all cell lines infected with\nthe BFP-expressing strains E2348/69, HB101(pMAR7), and\nE2348/69(pOG127). Figure 4 shows the electrophoretic result\nof extracted DNA from HeLa cells and clearly indicates DNA\ndegradation after a 5-h incubation with HB101(pMAR7),\nE2348/69(pOG127), and E2348/69 and overnight treatment\nwith VT1. Some DNA degradation was also observed with\nCVD206. No such degradation was observed when HeLa cells\nwere untreated or incubated with HB101, JPN15, or 31-6-1(1).\nSimilar results were achieved using Caco-2 and HEp-2 cells\n(not shown). These DNA patterns, although not the typical\nladders generated by other apoptosis-inducing agents, are con-\nsistent with those reported for other apoptosis-inducing bac-\nteria (11) and likely represent the mixed apoptosis-necrosis\nindicated by the electron microscope and \ufb02ow cytometry re-\nsults in this study. Furthermore, others have reported that\ncleavage of internucleosomal DNA in epithelial cells may be\ndefective, resulting in less distinctive DNA fragmentation pat-\nterns (38).\nRelative contributions of bfp and eae. In order to assess the\nrelative contributions of bfp and eae genes to cell death, we\ncompared treatment with wild-type EPEC E2348/69 and the\neae-negative mutant and bfp-negative mutant of E2348/69 and\nassessed by \ufb02ow cytometry the extent of apoptotic and necrotic\ncell death. Figure 5 shows the dot plots for four treatments of\nHeLa cells, comparing the intensity of amexin V-FITC stain-\ning with PI staining. Lower left quadrants re\ufb02ect percentages\nof viable cells (nonapoptotic, nomecrotic cells; i.e., low levels\nof both amexin-FITC and PI). Lower right quadrants indicate\nFIG. 1.

IMMUN.\n\npercentages of early apoptotic cells while upper quadrants\n(elevated PI staining) re\ufb02ect cells in late apoptosis or necrosis.\nTreatment with E2348/69 showed increased numbers of both\napoptotic and necrotic cells relative to the untreated sample.\nDisruption of the bfp gene in 31-6-1(1) reduced the percentage\nof early apoptotic cells to that of the untreated sample. The\nlevel of late apoptosis or necrosis was also diminished with the\nbfp-negative mutant. Disruption of the eae gene in CVD206\nresulted in levels of early apoptosis similar to that for the wild\ntype, E2348/69, but with markedly less necrosis and late apo-\nptosis. This result suggests that BFP may be important in the\ninduction of apoptosis while intimin may play a more signi\ufb01-\ncant role in the induction of necrosis. Certainly, the reduction\nof early apoptosis to background levels with the bfp mutant and\nthe maintenance of wild-type levels of early apoptosis with the\neae mutant support the involvement of BFP but not intimin in\nthe induction of apoptosis. Since the upper quadrant likely\nincludes cells which have undergone apoptosis and eventually\nlost membrane integrity as well as those cells which have pro-\nceeded through a necrotic pathway, it is not possible to de\ufb01n-\nitively assign apoptosis and necrosis induction roles.\nBacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. Consistent with previ-\nous reports, BFP expression correlated with adhesion to cul-\ntured epithelial cells (Fig. 6). BFP-expressing strains generally\nadhered better to both HeLa (shown) and Caco-2 (not shown)\ncells than did the non-BFP-expressing correlates. HB101\n(pMAR7) adhered better to HeLa cells than did HB101\n(pCVD426) (Fig. 6D), which adhered only slightly better than\nHB101, but only HB101(pMAR7) was capable of inducing\nsigni\ufb01cant levels of cell death (Fig. 7).\nDISCUSSION\nBacterial colonization and infection of various tissues is the\nresult of recognition by bacterial adhesins of speci\ufb01c receptors\non the target tissue. Once the microorganism approaches the\nhost cell surface, it is essential for the pathogen to use its full\ngenetic potential for attachment and the synthesis of other\ntraits to secure a speci\ufb01c niche within the host that will permit\nits replication and survival. Accordingly, the induction of host\ncell death may represent a strategy developed by microorgan-\nisms to ensure their survival, infection, and invasion of the\ntarget tissue.\nInduction of host cell death has been reported for several\ngastrointestinal pathogens, including Yersinia (34), Salmonella\n(35), Shigella (47, 48), Helicobacter pylori (36), and enterohe-\nmorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (3). EPEC infection has been re-\nported to cause pathological damage of the target tissue; how-\never, features of apoptotic cell death were not indicated (20,\n42). Evidence of EPEC-induced apoptotic and necrotic cell\ndeath has been reported for cell lines including HEp-2, T84,\nCaco-2, and HeLa cells (3, 11).\nOur investigation of the cell death triggered by E. coli strains\nindicates a role for BFP in the induction of apoptosis. Flow\ncytometric analysis showed that the epithelial cell apoptosis\nwas much greater with any of the BFP-expressing E. coli strains\nFIG. 2.

Using PS exposure as a\nmarker of apoptosis, we tested treatment of HEp-2, Caco-2,\nand HeLa cells with various BPF\u0001 and BFP\u0002 strains. In all\ncases, the BFP-expressing strains induced elevated levels of\napoptosis over their non-BFP-expressing correlates. Interest-\ningly, HEp-2 and HeLa cells showed signi\ufb01cant induction of\napoptosis after incubation with HB101(pMAR7) in contrast to\nother BFP\u0001 strains. This may be a consequence of interference\nby lipopolysaccharide or type 1 \ufb01mbriae expressed by wild-type\nE2348/69 and E2348/69(pOG127) strains but not by HB101.\nThis is consistent with other reports that lipopolysaccharide\nFIG. 3.

Treat-\nment with sterile \ufb01ltered supernatants resulted in background\nlevels of cell death (5%) found in untreated cells. In all cases,\nBFP-expressing strains induced signi\ufb01cantly higher levels of\ncell death and showed higher levels of adhesion to the same\ncell lines. Levels of adhesion were consistent with the ability to\ninduce apoptosis with HB101(pMAR7)- and E2348/69-in-\nfected cells showing the highest levels of both adhesion and\napoptosis. The absence of the BFP adhesion appeared to have\na more profound effect on induction of cell death than did the\nabsence of other adhesins such as intimin (in strain CVD206).\nPreincubation with anti-BFP at concentrations which have\nbeen shown to reduce EPEC adhesion (21) was also found to\ninhibit EPEC induction of cell death.\nAnalysis of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation con\ufb01rmed\nthe induction of apoptosis by the BFP-expressing strains. Elec-\ntron microscopic analysis of Caco-2 and HeLa cell lines incu-\nbated with BFP-expressing E. coli strains also shows a clear\nincrease in both apoptotic and necrotic cells in contrast to the\nBFP-negative strains.\nThrough a double labeling experiment with amexin V-FITC\nand PI, we were able to distinguish between early apoptotic\nand late apoptotic or necrotic cells. In this analysis, HeLa cells\ntreated\nwith\nE2348/69,\n31-6-1(1),\nand\nthe\neae-de\ufb01cient\nCVD206 strain revealed that the eae mutant strain induced\nhigher levels of apoptosis and less necrosis than the wild-type\nparent strain. This has also been observed with the T84 cell line\n(data not shown). Ablation of the bfp gene in strain 31-6-1(1),\nwhich still expresses intimin, reduced the level of early apo-\nptotic cells to that of untreated cells. However, as we have\npreviously noted, the detection of necrosis in vitro may not be\nphysiological, since nonphagocytosed apoptotic cells may even-\ntually lose their membrane intregrity and appear necrotic (3).\nConsequently, while we note differences in the relative levels of\napoptosis and necrosis, we have focused primarily on the ex-\ntent of apoptosis triggered by bacterial binding.\nA recent study has implicated the secreted virulence factor\nEspF in host cell death triggered by EPEC (12). In this study,\nan espF mutant was attenuated in its ability to induce host cell\ndeath as measured by uptake of ethidium homodimer. Addi-\ntional experiments showed that COS and HeLa cells trans-\nfected with espF appeared to undergo apoptotic cell death as\ndetermined by morphological changes. While the experiments\ndemonstrate a role for EspF as a cell death factor, the authors\nconclude that EspF camot completely account for the host cell\nkilling by EPEC. They note that the cell killing ability of the\nespF mutant was reduced but not entirely lost. It should also be\nnoted that the extent of cell death in the espF-transfected cells\nFIG. 4.

IMMUN.\n\nof cell death, like that of the EPEC adhesion mechanism, is a\nmultifactorial event involving several virulence factors includ-\ning EspF and BFP.\nInduction of apoptosis by BFP-expressing strains may be\nrelated to BFP receptor expression by the host cell. We have\npreviously demonstrated using thin-layer chromatography and\nliposome assays that EPEC recognizes phosphatidylethano-\nlamine (PE) in a speci\ufb01c and dose-dependent mamer and that\nadhesion to human epithelial cells is inhibitable by anti-PE (4).\nWe have also found that BFP expression correlates with PE\nrecognition (28a), which when considered together with the\npresent \ufb01ndings suggests that bacterial binding to host mem-\nbrane PE may play a role in the induction of apoptosis. All cell\nlines tested in this study expressed PE. Variations in the level\nof plasma membrane outer lea\ufb02et PE may explain differences\nin the extent of apoptosis induced in different cell lines. We\nhave shown that augmentation of outer lea\ufb02et PE levels\nthrough PE-liposome uptake by epithelial cells does increase\nbacterial binding, which in turn increases exposure of the ap-\noptotic marker PS (3).\nThe ligation of membrane PE by BFP-expressing EPEC may\ntrigger downstream events involving key mediators of apopto-\nsis, including ceramide. Ceramide levels may be increased\nthrough the inhibition of ceramide acylation. A phospholipase\nA2-like transacylase transfers an acyl group from PE to cer-\namide (1). Therefore, bacterial binding to host PE receptors\nmay reduce the PE pool, restrict this reaction, and elevate\nceramide levels. PE is also a substrate of phospholipase D,\nwhich catalyzes the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA) (29,\n45) which plays a pivotal role in the balance of mitogenic and\napoptotic responses. Sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phos-\nphate increase intracellular levels of PA, thereby stimulating\nmitogenesis, while ceramide inhibits phospholipase D activa-\ntion, thereby decreasing PA levels and enhancing the apoptotic\nresponse (22). The selective ligation of membrane PE by BFP-\nexpressing EPEC could reduce the availability of PE for phos-\npholipase D-mediated hydrolysis, resulting in reduced levels of\ncytosolic PA and disrupting the mitogen signaling cascade.\nBacterial induction of apoptosis could lead to a further reduc-\ntion in cytosolic exposure of PE, thereby enhancing this effect.\nBFP binding to host membrane PE may also contribute to\nmembrane events associated with apoptosis. PE is a nonbilayer\nphospholipid which has a high tendency to form the HII in-\nverted micelle phase (7, 13). Therefore, PE-rich membranes\ntend to exert bending \ufb02uctuations (8) and therefore to pro-\nmote physical membrane changes, including membrane fusion,\ninward membrane bending, and membrane budding. These\nchanges may affect membrane permeability, endocytosis, cell\ndivision, and cell budding associated with the formation of\napoptotic bodies. The importance of membrane PE is empha-\nsized by \ufb01ndings which show that lowering the PE content\ndiminished cell death during simulated ischemia and reperfu-\nsion (40). Therefore, events which sequester membrane PE,\nincluding bacterial binding, may contribute to apoptotic mem-\nbrane changes. Further study is required to determine the\nmechanism by which bacterial ligation of host cell PE contrib-\nutes to the induction of host cell death.\nWe have also reported that EHEC, another A/E gastroin-\ntestinal pathogen, binds PE and that EHEC binding to two\nepithelial cell lines correlates with plasma membrane outer\nlea\ufb02et levels of PE (4). Furthermore, EHEC, in a similar\nmamer to EPEC, induces apoptosis in a number of epithelial\ncell lines, which results in increased outer lea\ufb02et PE and bac-\nterial binding (3). The mechanism by which EHEC induces\napoptosis is unknown. It may be that EHEC also expresses a\nBFP-like pilus which may mediate host cell PE binding and\napoptosis. Interestingly, a mutation in the ler (LEE-encoded\nregulator) gene of EHEC resulted in the expression of an\nunidenti\ufb01ed pilus and also enhanced epithelial cell adhesion\n(19).\nIn conclusion, these results clearly indicate a direct correla-\ntion between BFP expression and the induction of host cell\ndeath including apoptosis. BFP, an established EPEC viru-\nlence factor, has been previously implicated in initial host cell\nattachment and in bacterial autoaggregation. These \ufb01ndings\nnow de\ufb01ne another role for BFP in the pathogenesis of EPEC\ninfection. Our earlier work has proposed that the induction of\napoptosis by EPEC and EHEC provides a bacterial advantage\nby augmenting outer lea\ufb02et levels of the PE receptor candidate\n(3). Although apoptotic cells are eventually phagocytosed in\nvivo, receptor ampli\ufb01cation through apoptosis can offer a tem-\nporary adhesion advantage to the bacterium. Other advantages\nmay include enhanced access to nutrients and to the subepi-\nthelial layer. It has been suggested that apoptosis of epithelial\ncells triggered by Pseudomonas aeruginosa may serve as a ve-\nhicle for clearance and bacterial dissemination (39, 46). Alter-\nnatively, cell death may function as a host mechanism to limit\nbacterial infection. EPEC also stimulates a number of anti-\napoptotic pathways within the cell and it has been suggested\nthat EPEC has developed strategies to slow host cell killing\n(10). It may be that the coordination of these apoptotic and\nantiapoptotic signaling events in the host cell by the bacterium\nultimately determines the infection outcome.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by grants from the Crohn\u2019s and Colitis\nFoundation of Canada (to D.E.B.F.) and the Medical Research Coun-\ncil of Canada (MT 13073) (to C.A.L.).\nREFERENCES\n1.

The bundle-forming pilus (BFP) of EPEC is an established\nvirulence factor encoded on the EPEC adherence factor plasmid (EAF) and has been implicated in both\nlocalized adherence to host cells and bacterial autoaggregation. We investigated the role of BFP in the ability\nof EPEC binding to kill host epithelial cells. BFP-expressing strains killed all three cell lines tested, comprising\nHEp-2 (laryngeal), HeLa (cervical), and Caco-2 (colonic) cells. Analysis of phosphatidylserine expression,\ninternucleosomal cleavage of host cell DNA, and morphological changes detected by electron microscopy\nindicated evidence of apoptosis. The extent of cell death was signi\ufb01cantly greater for BFP-expressing strains,\nincluding E2348/69, a wild-type clinical isolate, as well as for a laboratory strain, HB101, transformed with a\nbfp-carrying plasmid. Strains which did not express BFP induced signi\ufb01cantly less cell death, including a bfpA\ndisruptional mutant of E2348/69, EAF plasmid-cured E2348/69, HB101, and HB101 complemented with the\nlocus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island. These results indicate a direct correlation between BFP\nexpression and induction of cell death, including apoptosis, an event which may involve the targeting of host\ncell membrane phosphatidylethanolamine.\nEnteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) associated with\nsevere infantile diarrhea represents a major health problem\namong infants, particularly in developing countries (37). Re-\nsearch using cultured epithelial cells indicates that EPEC at-\ntaches to host cells initially in a loose manner and then con-\nsolidates attachment in a more intimate manner (17). The\ninitial adherence phenotype, characterized in tissue culture\nassays as localized adherence, is associated with the production\nof plasmid-encoded type IV \ufb01mbriae known as bundle-forming\npili (BFP) (15, 21). More intimate attachment, characterized\nby the development of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions of\nthe brush border microvilli, is encoded in a chromosomal re-\ngion termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) (32).\nRecent studies with pediatric intestinal biopsy samples have\nminimized the role of BFP in host adhesion and have alterna-\ntively implicated BFP in the formation of bacterial aggregates\nwhich produce the localized adherence pattern typical of\nEPEC infection (25). Nevertheless, studies with volunteers\nwho have ingested BFP-expressing and non-BFP-expressing\nEPEC strains have con\ufb01rmed BFP as a virulence factor (5).\nAttachment of EPEC to the host cell is accompanied by a\nnumber of signal transduction events, including release of ino-\nsitol triphosphate and calcium, phosphorylation of myosin light\nchain, and activation of protein kinase C (10, 18). EPEC also\nsynthesizes and translocates into the host cell a protein known\nas translocated intimin receptor (Tir), which after tyrosine\nphosphorylation permits intimate attachment through the bac-\nterial protein intimin (41). Recently, we and others have re-\nported that EPEC also induces cell death in cultured epithelial\ncells (2, 3, 11). Evidence of both apoptosis and necrosis has\nbeen observed. However, the bacterial structures responsible\nfor the triggering of these cell death pathways have not been\nidenti\ufb01ed. In this study, we demonstrate a role for BFP in the\ninduction of cell death, including apoptosis, in host epithelial\ncells.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and cultivation conditions. The characteristics of bacterial\nstrains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The E2348/69 derivatives 31-6-\n1(1),\nJPN\n15,\nand\nE2348/69(pOG127)\nas\nwell\nas\nHB101pMAR7\nand\nHB101(pCVD426) were kindly provided by J. Kaper, University of Maryland.\n31-6-1(1) is a previously described mutant of E2348/69 with a TnphoA insertion\nin the bfpA gene of the pMAR2 (60 MDA virulence plasmid from E2348/69)\nplasmid (14, 15). JPN15 is an E2348/69 derivative cured of plasmid pMAR2\nduring passage through a volunteer (27). The plasmid pOG127 (pMAR2 plasmid\nwith a perA::cat mutation) was transferred to strain JPN15 to generate E2348/\n69(pOG127). Since Per (plasmid-encoded regulator) regulates bfp expression,\nthis strain expresses BFP at lower levels than E2348/69. CVD206 is an eae mutant\nof E2348/69 constructed using a suicide vector with a pir-dependent R6K repli-\ncon and the sacB gene of Bacillus subtilis (16). HB101(pMAR7) is an avirulent\nlaboratory strain, HB101, complemented with pMAR7 plasmid (an ampicillin-\nresistant derivative of the EPEC adherence factor [EAF] plasmid) which con-\ntains the bfp gene (23). HB101(pCVD426) is complemented with pCVD426\ngenerated by cloning the entire LEE region from E2348/69 into the cosmid\nvector pCVD551 (33). Bacteria were stored in tryptic soy broth containing 20%\n(vol/vol) glycerol at \u000270\u00b0C. Prior to use, bacteria were cultured on Trypticase soy\nagar with 5% de\ufb01brinated sheep blood supplemented with the appropriate an-\n* Corresponding author.

Bacterial expression of BFP was assessed by\nWestern blotting using a polyclonal anti-BFP antiserum (generous gift of J.\nGiron, Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico) as previously de-\nscribed (21). After overnight growth, the bacteria were harvested, washed once\nwith antibiotic-free cell culture medium, and resuspended in the epithelial cell\nculture medium as indicated below.\nCell culture. The human epithelial cells HEp-2 (human laryngeal cell line),\nHeLa (human cervical cell line), and Caco-2 (human colonic cell line) were\nobtained from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. HEp-2 and\nHeLa cells were grown in minimum essential medium (Gibco Laboratories,\nGrand Island, N.Y.) supplemented with decomplemented 10% fetal calf serum\n(Cansera International Inc.), 0.5% L-glutamine (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa\nMesa, Calif.), 0.1% sodium bicarbonate (ICN), and 0.1% gentamycin at 37\u00b0C in\n5% CO2. The human colonic Caco-2 cells were grown in minimum essential\nmedium with Earl\u2019s salts (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 0.5% L-glutamine,\nnonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.1% gentamycin (Gibco\nBRL) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.\nAssessment of outer lea\ufb02et levels of PS. The level of outer lea\ufb02et phosphati-\ndylserine (PS) on cells incubated with media or bacteria was determined by \ufb02ow\ncytometry following treatment with \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated an-\nnexin V (annexin V-FITC; Pharmingen International, Mississauga, Ontario,\nCanada) according to the method of Vermes et al. (44). Approximately 106 cells\n(70% con\ufb02uent monolayer) were infected with 108 bacteria in culture medium\nwithout antibiotics for 5 to 18 h at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. After incubation,\nboth detached (supernatant) and adherent (trypsinized) cells were harvested and\nthe nonadherent bacteria were removed by centrifugation (260 \u0003 g for 10 min at\n4\u00b0C) after mixing with isotonic solution of 15% sucrose in phosphate-buffered\nsaline. The pellets were then resuspended in 100 \u0004l of binding buffer (10 mM\nHEPES, 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4), and thereafter 5 \u0004l of\nannexin V-FITC (Pharmingen) was added to each tube. The samples were then\nincubated at room temperature for 20 to 30 min, mixed with 400 \u0004l of binding\nbuffer, screened, and supplemented with 0.5 \u0004g of propidium iodide (PI)\n(Pharmingen) prior to \ufb02ow cytometric analysis. An increase in outer lea\ufb02et PS,\ndetected by annexin V-FITC, provides an indication of apoptosis and necrosis.\nCells which are late apoptotic or necrotic lose membrane integrity and will stain\nwith both annexin V-FITC and PI. Cells which retain membrane integrity, in-\ncluding viable and early apoptotic cells, will not take up PI. Therefore, the\ncombined use of annexin V-FITC and PI can distinguish between early apoptotic\nand late apoptotic or necrotic cells (24). To assess the effect of anti-BFP on\nEPEC induction of cell death, E2348/69 was preincubated with equivalent con-\ncentrations of either rabbit anti-BFP or rabbit nonimmune serum for 45 min at\nroom temperature followed by incubation with HEp-2 cells per the standard\nprotocol. Cell death was analyzed by \ufb02ow cytometry as described above.\nElectron microscopic analysis of cell death. Cell death was analyzed by elec-\ntron microscopy as previously described (3). Subcon\ufb02uent monolayers of all\nthree cell lines were incubated with media or bacteria (108) for 5 h and were then\nanalyzed by electron microscopy for morphological changes indicative of necrosis\nor apoptosis. Verotoxin 1 (VT1) treatment was used as a control for induction of\napoptosis. Cells which express outer lea\ufb02et Gb3 have been shown to be sensitive\nto VT-induced apoptosis (28, 43). In all cases, trypsinized cell monolayers and\ndetached cells (supernatant) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline,\ngently overlayed with 1 ml of universal \ufb01xative (equal parts of formaldehyde and\n1% glutaraldehyde), and post\ufb01xed in 2% osmium tetroxide. Dehydration was\ncarried out in graded ethanol, followed by propylene oxide and embedding in\nEpon. One-micrometer-thick sections were stained with toluidine blue and lead\ncitrate. Electron microscopic examination was conducted using a Philips 201\n(N. V. Philips, Gloeilampenfabrieken, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) transmis-\nsion electron microscope.\nAnalysis of internucleosomal fragmentation. Analysis of DNA fragmentation\nwas carried out as previously described (3). Briefy, all trypsinized cells and those\nfrom supernatants were harvested by centrifugation and gently lysed with hypo-\ntonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100) on ice\nfor 10 min. After 10 min of centrifugation at 13,700 \u0003 g and 4\u00b0C, the superna-\ntants were mixed well with an equal volume of 1:1 phenol-chloroform and\nrecentrifuged. After transfer, the upper phases containing DNA were incubated\nwith 1 \u0004g of glycogen, and a 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and 1 ml of\nabsolute ethanol were added and incubated at \u000220\u00b0C overnight. The DNA was\npelleted by centrifugation (14,000 \u0003 g for 20 min) at 4\u00b0C, washed once with 70%\nethanol, and air dried at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA pellets were\ndissolved in 10 \u0004l of Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA),\nmixed with 12 \u0004l of RNase (20 \u0004g/ml in Tris-EDTA), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for\n30 min. Samples were incubated with 3 \u0004l of loading buffer (50 mM EDTA, 15%\n[wt/vol] Ficoll, 0.25% [wt/vol] bromophenol blue) at 65\u00b0C for 15 min and elec-\ntrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel at 50 V for 90 min.\nBacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. Bacterial binding to epithelial cells was\nassayed as previously described (3). Approximately 108 bacteria were incubated\nwith 106 cells (70 to 80% con\ufb02uent monolayer) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. After incubation\nwith bacteria, both detached and adherent (trypsinized) cells were harvested and\nseparated from nonadherent bacteria by centrifugation through an isotonic 15%\nsucrose solution. Bacterial binding was detected using a polyclonal anti-E. coli\n(all antigens) antibody (Virostat) and a goat anti-rabbit\u2013FITC conjugate (Sigma)\nand quanti\ufb01ed by \ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using a Becton\nDickinson FACSscan \ufb02ow cytometer. All samples were analyzed with Cell Quest\nsoftware. Histogram plots showing cell count versus \ufb02uorescence intensity are\nprovided.\nRESULTS\nEffect of BFP expression on host cell morphology. Electron\nmicroscopic analysis of epithelial cell morphology indicated a\ncorrelation between BFP expression and the extent of apopto-\nsis and necrosis. Western blot analysis con\ufb01rmed expression of\nBFP for all bfp-positive strains and lack of expression for all\nbfp-negative strains (data not shown). Evidence of apoptosis\nincluded membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and mar-\ngination. Necrotic cells, on the other hand, were typically\nlarger and lighter, with plasma membrane lesions and mito-\nchondrial abnormalities. For both HeLa (Fig. 1) and Caco-2\n(Fig. 2) cells, all BFP-expressing strains, including E2348/69,\nHB101(pMAR7), and E2348/69(pOG127), induced consis-\ntently signi\ufb01cantly higher levels of apoptosis and necrosis than\nthose produced by incubation with the corresponding BFP-\nnegative strains, 31-6-1(1), HB101, and JPN15, respectively\n(P \u0005 0.05). Even CVD206, which expresses BFP but not in-\ntimin, triggered higher levels of cell death than did the BFP-\nnegative strains, although the levels were somewhat lower than\nTABLE 1.

Untreated cells\nshowed less than 5% apoptosis and necrosis combined (not\nshown). Overnight treatment of HeLa cells with VT1 induced\nlevels of cell death similar to those for the BFP-expressing\nstrains. Caco-2 cells, which have been reported to express\nlower levels of plasma membrane VT receptor (28) and should\ntherefore be less sensitive to VT1 treatment, showed lower\nlevels of cell death in response to overnight VT1 treatment.\nHeLa cells express higher levels of membrane VT receptor\n(26) and were indeed more sensitive to VT-induced cell death.\nEffect of BFP expression on host cell outer lea\ufb02et PS. Flow\ncytometric analysis of three cell lines infected with various E.\ncoli strains resulted in increased outer lea\ufb02et PS levels after\ntreatment with any of the BFP-expressing strains tested. Figure\n3 shows the histogram plots of annexin V-FITC staining (to\ndetect outer lea\ufb02et PS) for HEp-2, Caco-2, and HeLa cells\ntreated with BFP-positive strains and the corresponding BFP-\nnegative strains. In each case, treatment with the BFP-express-\ning strains [E2348/69, E2348/69(pOG127), and HB101(pMAR7)]\nresulted in elevated outer lea\ufb02et PS levels compared to treat-\nment with the non-BFP-expressing strains [31-6-1(1), JPN15,\nand HB101]. HB101(pCVD426), which expresses the intimin\nadhesin but not BFP, showed PS levels identical to those for\nHB101 (see Fig. 7). Treatment with sterile \ufb01ltered superna-\ntants resulted in PS levels similar to those of untreated cells\n(not shown). Preincubation of EPEC with anti-BFP reduced\nthe level of cell death relative to controls with either no anti-\nserum or equivalent concentrations of rabbit nonimmune se-\nrum (Table 2). At a concentration of 0.89 mg of anti-BFP per\nml, cell viability was increased to 65%, over that with no anti-\nserum (43%) or rabbit nonimmune serum (50%).\nEffect of BFP expression on DNA fragmentation. Agarose\ngel electrophoresis of cellular DNA showed evidence of inter-\nnucleosomal DNA fragmentation in all cell lines infected with\nthe BFP-expressing strains E2348/69, HB101(pMAR7), and\nE2348/69(pOG127). Figure 4 shows the electrophoretic result\nof extracted DNA from HeLa cells and clearly indicates DNA\ndegradation after a 5-h incubation with HB101(pMAR7),\nE2348/69(pOG127), and E2348/69 and overnight treatment\nwith VT1. Some DNA degradation was also observed with\nCVD206. No such degradation was observed when HeLa cells\nwere untreated or incubated with HB101, JPN15, or 31-6-1(1).\nSimilar results were achieved using Caco-2 and HEp-2 cells\n(not shown). These DNA patterns, although not the typical\nladders generated by other apoptosis-inducing agents, are con-\nsistent with those reported for other apoptosis-inducing bac-\nteria (11) and likely represent the mixed apoptosis-necrosis\nindicated by the electron microscope and \ufb02ow cytometry re-\nsults in this study. Furthermore, others have reported that\ncleavage of internucleosomal DNA in epithelial cells may be\ndefective, resulting in less distinctive DNA fragmentation pat-\nterns (38).\nRelative contributions of bfp and eae. In order to assess the\nrelative contributions of bfp and eae genes to cell death, we\ncompared treatment with wild-type EPEC E2348/69 and the\neae-negative mutant and bfp-negative mutant of E2348/69 and\nassessed by \ufb02ow cytometry the extent of apoptotic and necrotic\ncell death. Figure 5 shows the dot plots for four treatments of\nHeLa cells, comparing the intensity of annexin V-FITC stain-\ning with PI staining. Lower left quadrants re\ufb02ect percentages\nof viable cells (nonapoptotic, nonnecrotic cells; i.e., low levels\nof both annexin-FITC and PI). Lower right quadrants indicate\nFIG. 1.

IMMUN.\n\npercentages of early apoptotic cells while upper quadrants\n(elevated PI staining) re\ufb02ect cells in late apoptosis or necrosis.\nTreatment with E2348/69 showed increased numbers of both\napoptotic and necrotic cells relative to the untreated sample.\nDisruption of the bfp gene in 31-6-1(1) reduced the percentage\nof early apoptotic cells to that of the untreated sample. The\nlevel of late apoptosis or necrosis was also diminished with the\nbfp-negative mutant. Disruption of the eae gene in CVD206\nresulted in levels of early apoptosis similar to that for the wild\ntype, E2348/69, but with markedly less necrosis and late apo-\nptosis. This result suggests that BFP may be important in the\ninduction of apoptosis while intimin may play a more signi\ufb01-\ncant role in the induction of necrosis. Certainly, the reduction\nof early apoptosis to background levels with the bfp mutant and\nthe maintenance of wild-type levels of early apoptosis with the\neae mutant support the involvement of BFP but not intimin in\nthe induction of apoptosis. Since the upper quadrant likely\nincludes cells which have undergone apoptosis and eventually\nlost membrane integrity as well as those cells which have pro-\nceeded through a necrotic pathway, it is not possible to de\ufb01n-\nitively assign apoptosis and necrosis induction roles.\nBacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. Consistent with previ-\nous reports, BFP expression correlated with adhesion to cul-\ntured epithelial cells (Fig. 6). BFP-expressing strains generally\nadhered better to both HeLa (shown) and Caco-2 (not shown)\ncells than did the non-BFP-expressing correlates. HB101\n(pMAR7) adhered better to HeLa cells than did HB101\n(pCVD426) (Fig. 6D), which adhered only slightly better than\nHB101, but only HB101(pMAR7) was capable of inducing\nsigni\ufb01cant levels of cell death (Fig. 7).\nDISCUSSION\nBacterial colonization and infection of various tissues is the\nresult of recognition by bacterial adhesins of speci\ufb01c receptors\non the target tissue. Once the microorganism approaches the\nhost cell surface, it is essential for the pathogen to use its full\ngenetic potential for attachment and the synthesis of other\ntraits to secure a speci\ufb01c niche within the host that will permit\nits replication and survival. Accordingly, the induction of host\ncell death may represent a strategy developed by microorgan-\nisms to ensure their survival, infection, and invasion of the\ntarget tissue.\nInduction of host cell death has been reported for several\ngastrointestinal pathogens, including Yersinia (34), Salmonella\n(35), Shigella (47, 48), Helicobacter pylori (36), and enterohe-\nmorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (3). EPEC infection has been re-\nported to cause pathological damage of the target tissue; how-\never, features of apoptotic cell death were not indicated (20,\n42). Evidence of EPEC-induced apoptotic and necrotic cell\ndeath has been reported for cell lines including HEp-2, T84,\nCaco-2, and HeLa cells (3, 11).\nOur investigation of the cell death triggered by E. coli strains\nindicates a role for BFP in the induction of apoptosis. Flow\ncytometric analysis showed that the epithelial cell apoptosis\nwas much greater with any of the BFP-expressing E. coli strains\nFIG. 2.

Using PS exposure as a\nmarker of apoptosis, we tested treatment of HEp-2, Caco-2,\nand HeLa cells with various BPF\u0001 and BFP\u0002 strains. In all\ncases, the BFP-expressing strains induced elevated levels of\napoptosis over their non-BFP-expressing correlates. Interest-\ningly, HEp-2 and HeLa cells showed signi\ufb01cant induction of\napoptosis after incubation with HB101(pMAR7) in contrast to\nother BFP\u0001 strains. This may be a consequence of interference\nby lipopolysaccharide or type 1 \ufb01mbriae expressed by wild-type\nE2348/69 and E2348/69(pOG127) strains but not by HB101.\nThis is consistent with other reports that lipopolysaccharide\nFIG. 3.

Treat-\nment with sterile \ufb01ltered supernatants resulted in background\nlevels of cell death (5%) found in untreated cells. In all cases,\nBFP-expressing strains induced signi\ufb01cantly higher levels of\ncell death and showed higher levels of adhesion to the same\ncell lines. Levels of adhesion were consistent with the ability to\ninduce apoptosis with HB101(pMAR7)- and E2348/69-in-\nfected cells showing the highest levels of both adhesion and\napoptosis. The absence of the BFP adhesion appeared to have\na more profound effect on induction of cell death than did the\nabsence of other adhesins such as intimin (in strain CVD206).\nPreincubation with anti-BFP at concentrations which have\nbeen shown to reduce EPEC adhesion (21) was also found to\ninhibit EPEC induction of cell death.\nAnalysis of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation con\ufb01rmed\nthe induction of apoptosis by the BFP-expressing strains. Elec-\ntron microscopic analysis of Caco-2 and HeLa cell lines incu-\nbated with BFP-expressing E. coli strains also shows a clear\nincrease in both apoptotic and necrotic cells in contrast to the\nBFP-negative strains.\nThrough a double labeling experiment with annexin V-FITC\nand PI, we were able to distinguish between early apoptotic\nand late apoptotic or necrotic cells. In this analysis, HeLa cells\ntreated\nwith\nE2348/69,\n31-6-1(1),\nand\nthe\neae-de\ufb01cient\nCVD206 strain revealed that the eae mutant strain induced\nhigher levels of apoptosis and less necrosis than the wild-type\nparent strain. This has also been observed with the T84 cell line\n(data not shown). Ablation of the bfp gene in strain 31-6-1(1),\nwhich still expresses intimin, reduced the level of early apo-\nptotic cells to that of untreated cells. However, as we have\npreviously noted, the detection of necrosis in vitro may not be\nphysiological, since nonphagocytosed apoptotic cells may even-\ntually lose their membrane intregrity and appear necrotic (3).\nConsequently, while we note differences in the relative levels of\napoptosis and necrosis, we have focused primarily on the ex-\ntent of apoptosis triggered by bacterial binding.\nA recent study has implicated the secreted virulence factor\nEspF in host cell death triggered by EPEC (12). In this study,\nan espF mutant was attenuated in its ability to induce host cell\ndeath as measured by uptake of ethidium homodimer. Addi-\ntional experiments showed that COS and HeLa cells trans-\nfected with espF appeared to undergo apoptotic cell death as\ndetermined by morphological changes. While the experiments\ndemonstrate a role for EspF as a cell death factor, the authors\nconclude that EspF cannot completely account for the host cell\nkilling by EPEC. They note that the cell killing ability of the\nespF mutant was reduced but not entirely lost. It should also be\nnoted that the extent of cell death in the espF-transfected cells\nFIG. 4.

IMMUN.\n\nof cell death, like that of the EPEC adhesion mechanism, is a\nmultifactorial event involving several virulence factors includ-\ning EspF and BFP.\nInduction of apoptosis by BFP-expressing strains may be\nrelated to BFP receptor expression by the host cell. We have\npreviously demonstrated using thin-layer chromatography and\nliposome assays that EPEC recognizes phosphatidylethano-\nlamine (PE) in a speci\ufb01c and dose-dependent manner and that\nadhesion to human epithelial cells is inhibitable by anti-PE (4).\nWe have also found that BFP expression correlates with PE\nrecognition (28a), which when considered together with the\npresent \ufb01ndings suggests that bacterial binding to host mem-\nbrane PE may play a role in the induction of apoptosis. All cell\nlines tested in this study expressed PE. Variations in the level\nof plasma membrane outer lea\ufb02et PE may explain differences\nin the extent of apoptosis induced in different cell lines. We\nhave shown that augmentation of outer lea\ufb02et PE levels\nthrough PE-liposome uptake by epithelial cells does increase\nbacterial binding, which in turn increases exposure of the ap-\noptotic marker PS (3).\nThe ligation of membrane PE by BFP-expressing EPEC may\ntrigger downstream events involving key mediators of apopto-\nsis, including ceramide. Ceramide levels may be increased\nthrough the inhibition of ceramide acylation. A phospholipase\nA2-like transacylase transfers an acyl group from PE to cer-\namide (1). Therefore, bacterial binding to host PE receptors\nmay reduce the PE pool, restrict this reaction, and elevate\nceramide levels. PE is also a substrate of phospholipase D,\nwhich catalyzes the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA) (29,\n45) which plays a pivotal role in the balance of mitogenic and\napoptotic responses. Sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phos-\nphate increase intracellular levels of PA, thereby stimulating\nmitogenesis, while ceramide inhibits phospholipase D activa-\ntion, thereby decreasing PA levels and enhancing the apoptotic\nresponse (22). The selective ligation of membrane PE by BFP-\nexpressing EPEC could reduce the availability of PE for phos-\npholipase D-mediated hydrolysis, resulting in reduced levels of\ncytosolic PA and disrupting the mitogen signaling cascade.\nBacterial induction of apoptosis could lead to a further reduc-\ntion in cytosolic exposure of PE, thereby enhancing this effect.\nBFP binding to host membrane PE may also contribute to\nmembrane events associated with apoptosis. PE is a nonbilayer\nphospholipid which has a high tendency to form the HII in-\nverted micelle phase (7, 13). Therefore, PE-rich membranes\ntend to exert bending \ufb02uctuations (8) and therefore to pro-\nmote physical membrane changes, including membrane fusion,\ninward membrane bending, and membrane budding. These\nchanges may affect membrane permeability, endocytosis, cell\ndivision, and cell budding associated with the formation of\napoptotic bodies. The importance of membrane PE is empha-\nsized by \ufb01ndings which show that lowering the PE content\ndiminished cell death during simulated ischemia and reperfu-\nsion (40). Therefore, events which sequester membrane PE,\nincluding bacterial binding, may contribute to apoptotic mem-\nbrane changes. Further study is required to determine the\nmechanism by which bacterial ligation of host cell PE contrib-\nutes to the induction of host cell death.\nWe have also reported that EHEC, another A/E gastroin-\ntestinal pathogen, binds PE and that EHEC binding to two\nepithelial cell lines correlates with plasma membrane outer\nlea\ufb02et levels of PE (4). Furthermore, EHEC, in a similar\nmanner to EPEC, induces apoptosis in a number of epithelial\ncell lines, which results in increased outer lea\ufb02et PE and bac-\nterial binding (3). The mechanism by which EHEC induces\napoptosis is unknown. It may be that EHEC also expresses a\nBFP-like pilus which may mediate host cell PE binding and\napoptosis. Interestingly, a mutation in the ler (LEE-encoded\nregulator) gene of EHEC resulted in the expression of an\nunidenti\ufb01ed pilus and also enhanced epithelial cell adhesion\n(19).\nIn conclusion, these results clearly indicate a direct correla-\ntion between BFP expression and the induction of host cell\ndeath including apoptosis. BFP, an established EPEC viru-\nlence factor, has been previously implicated in initial host cell\nattachment and in bacterial autoaggregation. These \ufb01ndings\nnow de\ufb01ne another role for BFP in the pathogenesis of EPEC\ninfection. Our earlier work has proposed that the induction of\napoptosis by EPEC and EHEC provides a bacterial advantage\nby augmenting outer lea\ufb02et levels of the PE receptor candidate\n(3). Although apoptotic cells are eventually phagocytosed in\nvivo, receptor ampli\ufb01cation through apoptosis can offer a tem-\nporary adhesion advantage to the bacterium. Other advantages\nmay include enhanced access to nutrients and to the subepi-\nthelial layer. It has been suggested that apoptosis of epithelial\ncells triggered by Pseudomonas aeruginosa may serve as a ve-\nhicle for clearance and bacterial dissemination (39, 46). Alter-\nnatively, cell death may function as a host mechanism to limit\nbacterial infection. EPEC also stimulates a number of anti-\napoptotic pathways within the cell and it has been suggested\nthat EPEC has developed strategies to slow host cell killing\n(10). It may be that the coordination of these apoptotic and\nantiapoptotic signaling events in the host cell by the bacterium\nultimately determines the infection outcome.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by grants from the Crohn\u2019s and Colitis\nFoundation of Canada (to D.E.B.F.) and the Medical Research Coun-\ncil of Canada (MT 13073) (to C.A.L.).\nREFERENCES\n1.

The bundle-forming pilus (BFP) of EPEC is an established\nvirulence factor encoded on the EPEC adherence factor plasmid (EAF) and has been implicated in both\nlocalized adherence to host cells and bacterial autoaggregation. We investigated the role of BFP in the ability\nof EPEC binding to kill host epithelial cells. BFP-expressing strains killed all three cell lines tested, comprising\nHEp-2 (laryngeal), HeLa (cervical), and Caco-2 (colonic) cells. Analysis of phosphatidylserine expression,\ninternucleosomal cleavage of host cell DNA, and morphological changes detected by electron microscopy\nindicated evidence of apoptosis. The extent of cell death was signi\ufb01cantly greater for BFP-expressing strains,\nincluding E2348/69, a wild-type clinical isolate, as well as for a laboratory strain, HB101, transformed with a\nbfp-carrying plasmid. Strains which did not express BFP induced signi\ufb01cantly less cell death, including a bfpA\ndisruptional mutant of E2348/69, EAF plasmid-cured E2348/69, HB101, and HB101 complemented with the\nlocus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island. These results indicate a direct correlation between BFP\nexpression and induction of cell death, including apoptosis, an event which may involve the targeting of host\ncell membrane phosphatidylethanolamine.\nEnteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) associated with\nsevere infantile diarrhea represents a major health problem\namong infants, particularly in developing countries (37). Re-\nsearch using cultured epithelial cells indicates that EPEC at-\ntaches to host cells initially in a loose mamer and then con-\nsolidates attachment in a more intimate mamer (17). The\ninitial adherence phenotype, characterized in tissue culture\nassays as localized adherence, is associated with the production\nof plasmid-encoded type 1V \ufb01mbriae known as bundle-forming\npili (BFP) (15, 21). More intimate attachment, characterized\nby the development of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions of\nthe brush border microvilli, is encoded in a chromosomal re-\ngion termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) (32).\nRecent studies with pediatric intestinal biopsy samples have\nminimized the role of BFP in host adhesion and have alterna-\ntively implicated BFP in the formation of bacterial aggregates\nwhich produce the localized adherence pattern typical of\nEPEC infection (25). Nevertheless, studies with volunteers\nwho have ingested BFP-expressing and non-BFP-expressing\nEPEC strains have con\ufb01rmed BFP as a virulence factor (5).\nAttachment of EPEC to the host cell is accompanied by a\nnumber of signal transduction events, including release of ino-\nsitol triphosphate and calcium, phosphorylation of myosin light\nchain, and activation of protein kinase C (10, 18). EPEC also\nsynthesizes and translocates into the host cell a protein known\nas translocated intimin receptor (Tir), which after tyrosine\nphosphorylation permits intimate attachment through the bac-\nterial protein intimin (41). Recently, we and others have re-\nported that EPEC also induces cell death in cultured epithelial\ncells (2, 3, 11). Evidence of both apoptosis and necrosis has\nbeen observed. However, the bacterial structures responsible\nfor the triggering of these cell death pathways have not been\nidenti\ufb01ed. 1n this study, we demonstrate a role for BFP in the\ninduction of cell death, including apoptosis, in host epithelial\ncells.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and cultivation conditions. The characteristics of bacterial\nstrains used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Kaper, University of Maryland.\n31-6-1(1) is a previously described mutant of E2348/69 with a TnphoA insertion\nin the bfpA gene of the pMAR2 (60 MDA virulence plasmid from E2348/69)\nplasmid (14, 15). JPN15 is an E2348/69 derivative cured of plasmid pMAR2\nduring passage through a volunteer (27). The plasmid pOG127 (pMAR2 plasmid\nwith a perA::cat mutation) was transferred to strain JPN15 to generate E2348/\n69(pOG127). Since Per (plasmid-encoded regulator) regulates bfp expression,\nthis strain expresses BFP at lower levels than E2348/69. CVD206 is an eae mutant\nof E2348/69 constructed using a suicide vector with a pir-dependent R6K repli-\ncon and the sacB gene of Bacillus subtilis (16). HB101(pMAR7) is an avirulent\nlaboratory strain, HB101, complemented with pMAR7 plasmid (an ampicillin-\nresistant derivative of the EPEC adherence factor [EAF] plasmid) which con-\ntains the bfp gene (23). HB101(pCVD426) is complemented with pCVD426\ngenerated by cloning the entire LEE region from E2348/69 into the cosmid\nvector pCVD551 (33).

Bacterial expression of BFP was assessed by\nWestern blotting using a polyclonal anti-BFP antiserum (generous gift of J.\nGiron, Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico) as previously de-\nscribed (21). After overnight growth, the bacteria were harvested, washed once\nwith antibiotic-free cell culture medium, and resuspended in the epithelial cell\nculture medium as indicated below.\nCell culture. The human epithelial cells HEp-2 (human laryngeal cell line),\nHeLa (human cervical cell line), and Caco-2 (human colonic cell line) were\nobtained from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. HEp-2 and\nHeLa cells were grown in minimum essential medium (Gibco Laboratories,\nGrand 1sland, N.Y.) supplemented with decomplemented 10% fetal calf serum\n(Cansera 1nternational 1nc.), 0.5% L-glutamine (ICN Biomedicals 1nc., Costa\nMesa, Calif.), 0.1% sodium bicarbonate (ICN), and 0.1% gentamycin at 37\u00b0C in\n5% CO2. The human colonic Caco-2 cells were grown in minimum essential\nmedium with Earl\u2019s salts (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 0.5% L-glutamine,\nnonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.1% gentamycin (Gibco\nBRL) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.\nAssessment of outer lea\ufb02et levels of PS. The level of outer lea\ufb02et phosphati-\ndylserine (PS) on cells incubated with media or bacteria was determined by \ufb02ow\ncytometry following treatment with \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated an-\nnexin V (amexin V-FITC; Pharmingen 1nternational, Mississauga, Ontario,\nCanada) according to the method of Vermes et al. (44). Approximately 106 cells\n(70% con\ufb02uent monolayer) were infected with 108 bacteria in culture medium\nwithout antibiotics for 5 to 18 h at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. After incubation,\nboth detached (supernatant) and adherent (trypsinized) cells were harvested and\nthe nonadherent bacteria were removed by centrifugation (260 \u0003 g for 10 min at\n4\u00b0C) after mixing with isotonic solution of 15% sucrose in phosphate-buffered\nsaline. The pellets were then resuspended in 100 \u0004l of binding buffer (10 mM\nHEPES, 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4), and thereafter 5 \u0004l of\namexin V-FITC (Pharmingen) was added to each tube. The samples were then\nincubated at room temperature for 20 to 30 min, mixed with 400 \u0004l of binding\nbuffer, screened, and supplemented with 0.5 \u0004g of propidium iodide (PI)\n(Pharmingen) prior to \ufb02ow cytometric analysis. An increase in outer lea\ufb02et PS,\ndetected by amexin V-FITC, provides an indication of apoptosis and necrosis.\nCells which are late apoptotic or necrotic lose membrane integrity and will stain\nwith both amexin V-FITC and PI. Cells which retain membrane integrity, in-\ncluding viable and early apoptotic cells, will not take up PI. Therefore, the\ncombined use of amexin V-FITC and PI can distinguish between early apoptotic\nand late apoptotic or necrotic cells (24). To assess the effect of anti-BFP on\nEPEC induction of cell death, E2348/69 was preincubated with equivalent con-\ncentrations of either rabbit anti-BFP or rabbit nonimmune serum for 45 min at\nroom temperature followed by incubation with HEp-2 cells per the standard\nprotocol. Cell death was analyzed by \ufb02ow cytometry as described above.\nElectron microscopic analysis of cell death. Cell death was analyzed by elec-\ntron microscopy as previously described (3). Subcon\ufb02uent monolayers of all\nthree cell lines were incubated with media or bacteria (108) for 5 h and were then\nanalyzed by electron microscopy for morphological changes indicative of necrosis\nor apoptosis. Verotoxin 1 (VT1) treatment was used as a control for induction of\napoptosis. Cells which express outer lea\ufb02et Gb3 have been shown to be sensitive\nto VT-induced apoptosis (28, 43). 1n all cases, trypsinized cell monolayers and\ndetached cells (supernatant) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline,\ngently overlayed with 1 ml of universal \ufb01xative (equal parts of formaldehyde and\n1% glutaraldehyde), and post\ufb01xed in 2% osmium tetroxide. Dehydration was\ncarried out in graded ethanol, followed by propylene oxide and embedding in\nEpon. One-micrometer-thick sections were stained with toluidine blue and lead\ncitrate. Electron microscopic examination was conducted using a Philips 201\n(N. V. Philips, Gloeilampenfabrieken, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) transmis-\nsion electron microscope.\nAnalysis of internucleosomal fragmentation. Analysis of DNA fragmentation\nwas carried out as previously described (3). Briefy, all trypsinized cells and those\nfrom supernatants were harvested by centrifugation and gently lysed with hypo-\ntonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100) on ice\nfor 10 min. After 10 min of centrifugation at 13,700 \u0003 g and 4\u00b0C, the superna-\ntants were mixed well with an equal volume of 1:1 phenol-chloroform and\nrecentrifuged. After transfer, the upper phases containing DNA were incubated\nwith 1 \u0004g of glycogen, and a 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and 1 ml of\nabsolute ethanol were added and incubated at \u000220\u00b0C overnight. The DNA was\npelleted by centrifugation (14,000 \u0003 g for 20 min) at 4\u00b0C, washed once with 70%\nethanol, and air dried at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA pellets were\ndissolved in 10 \u0004l of Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA),\nmixed with 12 \u0004l of RNase (20 \u0004g/ml in Tris-EDTA), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for\n30 min. Samples were incubated with 3 \u0004l of loading buffer (50 mM EDTA, 15%\n[wt/vol] Ficoll, 0.25% [wt/vol] bromophenol blue) at 65\u00b0C for 15 min and elec-\ntrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel at 50 V for 90 min.\nBacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. Bacterial binding to epithelial cells was\nassayed as previously described (3). Approximately 108 bacteria were incubated\nwith 106 cells (70 to 80% con\ufb02uent monolayer) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. After incubation\nwith bacteria, both detached and adherent (trypsinized) cells were harvested and\nseparated from nonadherent bacteria by centrifugation through an isotonic 15%\nsucrose solution. Bacterial binding was detected using a polyclonal anti-E. coli\n(all antigens) antibody (Virostat) and a goat anti-rabbit\u2013FITC conjugate (Sigma)\nand quanti\ufb01ed by \ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using a Becton\nDickinson FACSscan \ufb02ow cytometer. All samples were analyzed with Cell Quest\nsoftware. Histogram plots showing cell count versus \ufb02uorescence intensity are\nprovided.\nRESULTS\nEffect of BFP expression on host cell morphology. Electron\nmicroscopic analysis of epithelial cell morphology indicated a\ncorrelation between BFP expression and the extent of apopto-\nsis and necrosis. Western blot analysis con\ufb01rmed expression of\nBFP for all bfp-positive strains and lack of expression for all\nbfp-negative strains (data not shown). Evidence of apoptosis\nincluded membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and mar-\ngination. Necrotic cells, on the other hand, were typically\nlarger and lighter, with plasma membrane lesions and mito-\nchondrial abnormalities. For both HeLa (Fig. 1) and Caco-2\n(Fig. 2) cells, all BFP-expressing strains, including E2348/69,\nHB101(pMAR7), and E2348/69(pOG127), induced consis-\ntently signi\ufb01cantly higher levels of apoptosis and necrosis than\nthose produced by incubation with the corresponding BFP-\nnegative strains, 31-6-1(1), HB101, and JPN15, respectively\n(P \u0005 0.05). Even CVD206, which expresses BFP but not in-\ntimin, triggered higher levels of cell death than did the BFP-\nnegative strains, although the levels were somewhat lower than\nTABLE 1.

Untreated cells\nshowed less than 5% apoptosis and necrosis combined (not\nshown). Overnight treatment of HeLa cells with VT1 induced\nlevels of cell death similar to those for the BFP-expressing\nstrains. Caco-2 cells, which have been reported to express\nlower levels of plasma membrane VT receptor (28) and should\ntherefore be less sensitive to VT1 treatment, showed lower\nlevels of cell death in response to overnight VT1 treatment.\nHeLa cells express higher levels of membrane VT receptor\n(26) and were indeed more sensitive to VT-induced cell death.\nEffect of BFP expression on host cell outer lea\ufb02et PS. Flow\ncytometric analysis of three cell lines infected with various E.\ncoli strains resulted in increased outer lea\ufb02et PS levels after\ntreatment with any of the BFP-expressing strains tested. Figure\n3 shows the histogram plots of amexin V-FITC staining (to\ndetect outer lea\ufb02et PS) for HEp-2, Caco-2, and HeLa cells\ntreated with BFP-positive strains and the corresponding BFP-\nnegative strains. 1n each case, treatment with the BFP-express-\ning strains [E2348/69, E2348/69(pOG127), and HB101(pMAR7)]\nresulted in elevated outer lea\ufb02et PS levels compared to treat-\nment with the non-BFP-expressing strains [31-6-1(1), JPN15,\nand HB101]. HB101(pCVD426), which expresses the intimin\nadhesin but not BFP, showed PS levels identical to those for\nHB101 (see Fig. 7). Treatment with sterile \ufb01ltered superna-\ntants resulted in PS levels similar to those of untreated cells\n(not shown). Preincubation of EPEC with anti-BFP reduced\nthe level of cell death relative to controls with either no anti-\nserum or equivalent concentrations of rabbit nonimmune se-\nrum (Table 2). At a concentration of 0.89 mg of anti-BFP per\nml, cell viability was increased to 65%, over that with no anti-\nserum (43%) or rabbit nonimmune serum (50%).\nEffect of BFP expression on DNA fragmentation. Agarose\ngel electrophoresis of cellular DNA showed evidence of inter-\nnucleosomal DNA fragmentation in all cell lines infected with\nthe BFP-expressing strains E2348/69, HB101(pMAR7), and\nE2348/69(pOG127). Figure 4 shows the electrophoretic result\nof extracted DNA from HeLa cells and clearly indicates DNA\ndegradation after a 5-h incubation with HB101(pMAR7),\nE2348/69(pOG127), and E2348/69 and overnight treatment\nwith VT1. Some DNA degradation was also observed with\nCVD206. No such degradation was observed when HeLa cells\nwere untreated or incubated with HB101, JPN15, or 31-6-1(1).\nSimilar results were achieved using Caco-2 and HEp-2 cells\n(not shown). These DNA patterns, although not the typical\nladders generated by other apoptosis-inducing agents, are con-\nsistent with those reported for other apoptosis-inducing bac-\nteria (11) and likely represent the mixed apoptosis-necrosis\nindicated by the electron microscope and \ufb02ow cytometry re-\nsults in this study. Furthermore, others have reported that\ncleavage of internucleosomal DNA in epithelial cells may be\ndefective, resulting in less distinctive DNA fragmentation pat-\nterns (38).\nRelative contributions of bfp and eae. 1n order to assess the\nrelative contributions of bfp and eae genes to cell death, we\ncompared treatment with wild-type EPEC E2348/69 and the\neae-negative mutant and bfp-negative mutant of E2348/69 and\nassessed by \ufb02ow cytometry the extent of apoptotic and necrotic\ncell death. Figure 5 shows the dot plots for four treatments of\nHeLa cells, comparing the intensity of amexin V-FITC stain-\ning with PI staining. Lower left quadrants re\ufb02ect percentages\nof viable cells (nonapoptotic, nomecrotic cells; i.e., low levels\nof both amexin-FITC and PI). Lower right quadrants indicate\nFIG. 1.

The\nlevel of late apoptosis or necrosis was also diminished with the\nbfp-negative mutant. Disruption of the eae gene in CVD206\nresulted in levels of early apoptosis similar to that for the wild\ntype, E2348/69, but with markedly less necrosis and late apo-\nptosis. This result suggests that BFP may be important in the\ninduction of apoptosis while intimin may play a more signi\ufb01-\ncant role in the induction of necrosis. Certainly, the reduction\nof early apoptosis to background levels with the bfp mutant and\nthe maintenance of wild-type levels of early apoptosis with the\neae mutant support the involvement of BFP but not intimin in\nthe induction of apoptosis. Since the upper quadrant likely\nincludes cells which have undergone apoptosis and eventually\nlost membrane integrity as well as those cells which have pro-\nceeded through a necrotic pathway, it is not possible to de\ufb01n-\nitively assign apoptosis and necrosis induction roles.\nBacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. Consistent with previ-\nous reports, BFP expression correlated with adhesion to cul-\ntured epithelial cells (Fig. 6). BFP-expressing strains generally\nadhered better to both HeLa (shown) and Caco-2 (not shown)\ncells than did the non-BFP-expressing correlates. HB101\n(pMAR7) adhered better to HeLa cells than did HB101\n(pCVD426) (Fig. 6D), which adhered only slightly better than\nHB101, but only HB101(pMAR7) was capable of inducing\nsigni\ufb01cant levels of cell death (Fig. 7).\nDISCUSSION\nBacterial colonization and infection of various tissues is the\nresult of recognition by bacterial adhesins of speci\ufb01c receptors\non the target tissue. Once the microorganism approaches the\nhost cell surface, it is essential for the pathogen to use its full\ngenetic potential for attachment and the synthesis of other\ntraits to secure a speci\ufb01c niche within the host that will permit\nits replication and survival. Accordingly, the induction of host\ncell death may represent a strategy developed by microorgan-\nisms to ensure their survival, infection, and invasion of the\ntarget tissue. 1nduction of host cell death has been reported for several\ngastrointestinal pathogens, including Yersinia (34), Salmonella\n(35), Shigella (47, 48), Helicobacter pylori (36), and enterohe-\nmorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (3). EPEC infection has been re-\nported to cause pathological damage of the target tissue; how-\never, features of apoptotic cell death were not indicated (20,\n42). Evidence of EPEC-induced apoptotic and necrotic cell\ndeath has been reported for cell lines including HEp-2, T84,\nCaco-2, and HeLa cells (3, 11).\nOur investigation of the cell death triggered by E. coli strains\nindicates a role for BFP in the induction of apoptosis. Flow\ncytometric analysis showed that the epithelial cell apoptosis\nwas much greater with any of the BFP-expressing E. coli strains\nFIG. 2.

Using PS exposure as a\nmarker of apoptosis, we tested treatment of HEp-2, Caco-2,\nand HeLa cells with various BPF\u0001 and BFP\u0002 strains. 1n all\ncases, the BFP-expressing strains induced elevated levels of\napoptosis over their non-BFP-expressing correlates. 1nterest-\ningly, HEp-2 and HeLa cells showed signi\ufb01cant induction of\napoptosis after incubation with HB101(pMAR7) in contrast to\nother BFP\u0001 strains. This may be a consequence of interference\nby lipopolysaccharide or type 1 \ufb01mbriae expressed by wild-type\nE2348/69 and E2348/69(pOG127) strains but not by HB101.\nThis is consistent with other reports that lipopolysaccharide\nFIG. 3.

Treat-\nment with sterile \ufb01ltered supernatants resulted in background\nlevels of cell death (5%) found in untreated cells. 1n all cases,\nBFP-expressing strains induced signi\ufb01cantly higher levels of\ncell death and showed higher levels of adhesion to the same\ncell lines. Levels of adhesion were consistent with the ability to\ninduce apoptosis with HB101(pMAR7)- and E2348/69-in-\nfected cells showing the highest levels of both adhesion and\napoptosis. The absence of the BFP adhesion appeared to have\na more profound effect on induction of cell death than did the\nabsence of other adhesins such as intimin (in strain CVD206).\nPreincubation with anti-BFP at concentrations which have\nbeen shown to reduce EPEC adhesion (21) was also found to\ninhibit EPEC induction of cell death.\nAnalysis of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation con\ufb01rmed\nthe induction of apoptosis by the BFP-expressing strains. Elec-\ntron microscopic analysis of Caco-2 and HeLa cell lines incu-\nbated with BFP-expressing E. coli strains also shows a clear\nincrease in both apoptotic and necrotic cells in contrast to the\nBFP-negative strains.\nThrough a double labeling experiment with amexin V-FITC\nand PI, we were able to distinguish between early apoptotic\nand late apoptotic or necrotic cells. 1n this analysis, HeLa cells\ntreated\nwith\nE2348/69,\n31-6-1(1),\nand\nthe\neae-de\ufb01cient\nCVD206 strain revealed that the eae mutant strain induced\nhigher levels of apoptosis and less necrosis than the wild-type\nparent strain. This has also been observed with the T84 cell line\n(data not shown). Ablation of the bfp gene in strain 31-6-1(1),\nwhich still expresses intimin, reduced the level of early apo-\nptotic cells to that of untreated cells. However, as we have\npreviously noted, the detection of necrosis in vitro may not be\nphysiological, since nonphagocytosed apoptotic cells may even-\ntually lose their membrane intregrity and appear necrotic (3).\nConsequently, while we note differences in the relative levels of\napoptosis and necrosis, we have focused primarily on the ex-\ntent of apoptosis triggered by bacterial binding.\nA recent study has implicated the secreted virulence factor\nEspF in host cell death triggered by EPEC (12). 1n this study,\nan espF mutant was attenuated in its ability to induce host cell\ndeath as measured by uptake of ethidium homodimer. Addi-\ntional experiments showed that COS and HeLa cells trans-\nfected with espF appeared to undergo apoptotic cell death as\ndetermined by morphological changes. While the experiments\ndemonstrate a role for EspF as a cell death factor, the authors\nconclude that EspF camot completely account for the host cell\nkilling by EPEC. They note that the cell killing ability of the\nespF mutant was reduced but not entirely lost. 1t should also be\nnoted that the extent of cell death in the espF-transfected cells\nFIG. 4.

We have\npreviously demonstrated using thin-layer chromatography and\nliposome assays that EPEC recognizes phosphatidylethano-\nlamine (PE) in a speci\ufb01c and dose-dependent mamer and that\nadhesion to human epithelial cells is inhibitable by anti-PE (4).\nWe have also found that BFP expression correlates with PE\nrecognition (28a), which when considered together with the\npresent \ufb01ndings suggests that bacterial binding to host mem-\nbrane PE may play a role in the induction of apoptosis. All cell\nlines tested in this study expressed PE. Variations in the level\nof plasma membrane outer lea\ufb02et PE may explain differences\nin the extent of apoptosis induced in different cell lines. We\nhave shown that augmentation of outer lea\ufb02et PE levels\nthrough PE-liposome uptake by epithelial cells does increase\nbacterial binding, which in turn increases exposure of the ap-\noptotic marker PS (3).\nThe ligation of membrane PE by BFP-expressing EPEC may\ntrigger downstream events involving key mediators of apopto-\nsis, including ceramide. Ceramide levels may be increased\nthrough the inhibition of ceramide acylation. A phospholipase\nA2-like transacylase transfers an acyl group from PE to cer-\namide (1). Therefore, bacterial binding to host PE receptors\nmay reduce the PE pool, restrict this reaction, and elevate\nceramide levels. PE is also a substrate of phospholipase D,\nwhich catalyzes the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA) (29,\n45) which plays a pivotal role in the balance of mitogenic and\napoptotic responses. Sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phos-\nphate increase intracellular levels of PA, thereby stimulating\nmitogenesis, while ceramide inhibits phospholipase D activa-\ntion, thereby decreasing PA levels and enhancing the apoptotic\nresponse (22). The selective ligation of membrane PE by BFP-\nexpressing EPEC could reduce the availability of PE for phos-\npholipase D-mediated hydrolysis, resulting in reduced levels of\ncytosolic PA and disrupting the mitogen signaling cascade.\nBacterial induction of apoptosis could lead to a further reduc-\ntion in cytosolic exposure of PE, thereby enhancing this effect.\nBFP binding to host membrane PE may also contribute to\nmembrane events associated with apoptosis. PE is a nonbilayer\nphospholipid which has a high tendency to form the HII in-\nverted micelle phase (7, 13). Therefore, PE-rich membranes\ntend to exert bending \ufb02uctuations (8) and therefore to pro-\nmote physical membrane changes, including membrane fusion,\ninward membrane bending, and membrane budding. These\nchanges may affect membrane permeability, endocytosis, cell\ndivision, and cell budding associated with the formation of\napoptotic bodies. The importance of membrane PE is empha-\nsized by \ufb01ndings which show that lowering the PE content\ndiminished cell death during simulated ischemia and reperfu-\nsion (40). Therefore, events which sequester membrane PE,\nincluding bacterial binding, may contribute to apoptotic mem-\nbrane changes. Further study is required to determine the\nmechanism by which bacterial ligation of host cell PE contrib-\nutes to the induction of host cell death.\nWe have also reported that EHEC, another A/E gastroin-\ntestinal pathogen, binds PE and that EHEC binding to two\nepithelial cell lines correlates with plasma membrane outer\nlea\ufb02et levels of PE (4). Furthermore, EHEC, in a similar\nmamer to EPEC, induces apoptosis in a number of epithelial\ncell lines, which results in increased outer lea\ufb02et PE and bac-\nterial binding (3). The mechanism by which EHEC induces\napoptosis is unknown. 1t may be that EHEC also expresses a\nBFP-like pilus which may mediate host cell PE binding and\napoptosis. 1nterestingly, a mutation in the ler (LEE-encoded\nregulator) gene of EHEC resulted in the expression of an\nunidenti\ufb01ed pilus and also enhanced epithelial cell adhesion\n(19). 1n conclusion, these results clearly indicate a direct correla-\ntion between BFP expression and the induction of host cell\ndeath including apoptosis. BFP, an established EPEC viru-\nlence factor, has been previously implicated in initial host cell\nattachment and in bacterial autoaggregation. These \ufb01ndings\nnow de\ufb01ne another role for BFP in the pathogenesis of EPEC\ninfection. Our earlier work has proposed that the induction of\napoptosis by EPEC and EHEC provides a bacterial advantage\nby augmenting outer lea\ufb02et levels of the PE receptor candidate\n(3). Although apoptotic cells are eventually phagocytosed in\nvivo, receptor ampli\ufb01cation through apoptosis can offer a tem-\nporary adhesion advantage to the bacterium. Other advantages\nmay include enhanced access to nutrients and to the subepi-\nthelial layer. 1t has been suggested that apoptosis of epithelial\ncells triggered by Pseudomonas aeruginosa may serve as a ve-\nhicle for clearance and bacterial dissemination (39, 46). Alter-\nnatively, cell death may function as a host mechanism to limit\nbacterial infection. EPEC also stimulates a number of anti-\napoptotic pathways within the cell and it has been suggested\nthat EPEC has developed strategies to slow host cell killing\n(10). 1t may be that the coordination of these apoptotic and\nantiapoptotic signaling events in the host cell by the bacterium\nultimately determines the infection outcome.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by grants from the Crohn\u2019s and Colitis\nFoundation of Canada (to D.E.B.F.) and the Medical Research Coun-\ncil of Canada (MT 13073) (to C.A.L.).\nREFERENCES\n1.
