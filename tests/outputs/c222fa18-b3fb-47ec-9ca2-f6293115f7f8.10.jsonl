Replication of virus in the lower respiratory tract was also reduced >100-fold, but three\ndoses were required to prevent replication in the lungs. 1n ferrets infected with influenza B virus, single-dose\ntreatment (40 mg/kg given intraperitoneally) produced a similar but reduced response in comparison with that\nin ferrets infected with influenza A virus, indicating that dosing was not optimal for this virus.\nRecently, a number of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluororibosides have been\nreported to possess significant inhibitory activities against\ninfluenza A and B viruses in vitro in cells and human tracheal\norgan cultures and in vivo in mice (9, 10). The most potent,\n2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine\n(2'-FluorodGuo),\nwas\nsignifi-\ncantly more efficacious than amantadine or ribavirin, as mea-\nsured by a reduction in the titers of virus in mouse lungs when\nthe drug was given as multiple therapeutic doses (9) or as a\nsingle therapeutic dose (10).\nOn the basis of the encouraging data on drug efficacy in\nmice, we progressed to studies of efficacy in ferrets, a more\ncomparable model for humans (3, 5, 11, 12). 1n ferrets, we were\nable to examine the ability of 2'-FluorodGuo and a prodrug,\n2,6-diaminopurine-2'-fluororiboside (2'-FluorodDAP), to in-\nhibit viral replication in the respiratory tract and, consequently,\nto affect the expression of respiratory and constitutional signs\nas judged by an influx of leukocytes into the respiratory tract\nand the production of fever, respectively.\nFerrets were inoculated with influenza A virus, clone 7a\n(H3N2; virulent), of the reassortant virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34-\nA/England/939/69 or with influenza virus B/Singapore/222/79\nas described previously (11). Animals were treated with the\ncompounds, which were made up as fine suspensions in 1%\nTriton, by the intraperitoneal route for ease of administration\nat concentrations of 40, 20, 10, or 5 mg/kg of body weight. To\nmonitor the levels of the compounds in plasma, certain animals\nwere bled by cardiac puncture under halothane anesthesia 15\nmin after dosing, and the compounds were recovered by\nsolid-phase extraction by using 100-mg Analytichem Bond Elut\nC18 cartridges, which were washed with distilled water, and the\ncompounds were eluted with 50% (vol/vol) methanol-water.\nSamples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatog-\nraphy by using a SGE glass-lined column packed with 5 ,um\nODS-2 and monitored by UV detection at 250 nm. Detailed\npharmacokinetic studies have been carried out previously in\nmice, and 15 min after dosing proved to be the optimal\nsampling time (10). 1n both mice and ferrets, the prodrug\n* Corresponding author.

Monitoring for\nclinical signs of infection, that is, inflammatory cell counts and\ndetermination of pyrexia, was carried out as described previ-\nously, as were virus titrations in nasal washes and lung samples\n(7, 8, 11, 12). Virus titers were assayed by the allantoin-on-shell\n(egg-bit) or egg techniques (7, 8) or in Madin-Darby canine\nkidney (MDCK) cells (6).\nTo estimate immune protection, animals were challenged\nintranasally under ether anesthesia with 106 50% egg infective\ndoses (EID50s) of clone 7a 4 weeks after primary virus\ninoculation, and the level of protection was assessed as de-\nscribed previously (4).\nEffect against influenza A virus reassortant clone 7a. 1nitial\nstudies in ferrets were designed on the basis of previous studies\nin mice (9, 10) to determine the minimum number of doses\nrequired to limit infection. Ferrets were inoculated with 106\nEID50s of clone 7a and were divided into groups of four which\nwere treated intraperitoneally with three doses of 40 mg of\ncompound 2'-FluorodGuo per kg at 1, 8, and 24 h post-virus\nexposure, two doses at 1 and 24 h post-virus exposure, and 1\ndose at 1 h post-virus exposure. Treated ferrets were then\ncompared with untreated virus-inoculated controls. Virus titers\nin nasal washes and lungs, pyrexia, and the nasal inflammatory\nresponse were monitored at intervals after infection. Data\nfrom the single-dose study are plotted in Fig. 1, and the results\ncalculated as mean level of virus in nasal washes and lungs, and\ncell and fever indices (determined from areas under individual\ncurves) are shown for all dosing regimes in Table 1. 1n untreated animals (Fig. 1), virus peaked at 30 h (10-55\n50% egg-bit infective doses [EBID50s]/ml) and then declined\nrapidly, with a second small peak of virus shedding occurring\n96 h postinoculation (p.i.) (1025 EBID50s/ml) (Fig. lA-a). 1n\ncontrast,\nin animals treated with one dose of 40 mg of\n2'-FluorodGuo per kg at 1 h post-virus exposure, no initial\nvirus peak was detectable but a small peak occurred at 60 h\npost-virus exposure; this small peak was about 200-fold less\n(1035 EBID50s/ml) than the peak in the untreated virus-\ninoculated animals (Fig. lA-a). Similar statistically significant\nreductions in virus titers in nasal washes were seen in animals\ntreated with two or three doses of compound post-virus\nexposure (Table 1). Thus, infection was considerably delayed\n1864\n\nVOL. 38, 1994\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n0\n24\n48\n72\n96\n120\n144\n168\n192\n0\n24\n48\n72\n96\n120\n144\n168\n192\nTIME (h)\nTIME (h)\nTIME (h)\nFIG.\n1. Effect of 2'-deoxr-2'-fluororibosides on influenza A and B viruses. Groups of four ferrets inoculated with influenza A virus clone 7a\n(A) or influenza B virus B/Singapore (B) were treated with a single dose of 40 mg of 2'-FluorodGuo (A) or 2'-FluorodDAP (B) per kg at 1 h after\nvirus inoculation. Mean virus titers in nasal washes (a), mean rise in rectal temperatures (b), and mean cell counts (c) were monitored in control\nuntreated (0) and treated (0) animals.\nand reduced in treated animals compared with that in un-\ntreated animals.\nConstitutional signs represented by febrile responses were\nalso suppressed in treated, virus-inoculated animals. 1n un-\ntreated, inoculated animals, the febrile response lasted approx-\nimately 30 h, from 30 to 60 h p.i., with a peak mean temper-\nature rise of 2.3\u00b0C (Fig. lA-b). Animals treated with one, two,\nor three doses of 40 mg of 2'-FluorodGuo per kg showed little\nor no febrile response (Fig. lA-b; Table 1). However, animals\ntreated with three, but not fewer, doses of compound became\nsubdued for 48 h after the third injection, which was associated\nwith a transient hypothermia.

One group was treated with 2'-FluorodGuo for comparison.\nMean of the mathematically calculated areas under the curves for individual animals.\nThe statistical significance of differences in virus in nasal washes, cell, and fever indices were tested by the Student t test.\nd Standard errors of the mean are given in parentheses.\ntory cells in nasal washes, were also considerably reduced (Fig.\nlA-c). 1n untreated, virus-inoculated animals, the inflamma-\ntory cellular response started at about 24 h p.i., reached a\nmaximum of 10' cells at 54 h after inoculation, and remained\napproximately 100-fold above preinfection levels up to 168 h\np.i. (Fig. lA-c). Virus-inoculated animals treated with three,\ntwo, or one dose of 2'-FluorodGuo showed a significantly\nreduced response (Fig. lA-c; Table 1).\nVirus (10 *' EID50s) was detected in the lungs of untreated\nvirus-infected animals at 72 h p.i.; the titer rose to a peak of\n1061 EID50s at 120 h p.i. and declined rapidly thereafter,\nbarely reaching detectable levels (1026 EID50s) by 192 h p.i.\nPeak virus titers were reduced about 100-fold in animals\ntreated with one and two doses of 40 mg of 2'-FluorodGuo per\nkg and were barely detectable in animals treated with three\ndoses (Table 1). Viruses present in the lungs of treated animals\nhad susceptibilities to 2'-FluorodGuo similar to that of the\ninoculum virus when assayed by plaque reduction in MDCK\ncells.\nThe levels of the compound in plasma for six individual\nvirus-inoculated ferrets at 15 min after injection of the com-\npound ranged from 19.0 to 76.5 ,uM (mean, 43.2 \u00b1 9.1 ,uM),\nwhich is well above the 50% inhibitory concentration of 6.9 ,uM\n2'-FluorodGuo for clone 7a as determined in MDCK cells (9).\nDespite the reduced level of replication in both the upper\nand lower respiratory tracts of the virus-inoculated treated\nanimals, the hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers deter-\nmined by standard methods (2) were similar to those in\ncontrols (mean, 560 \u00b1 80 in comparison with 240 \u00b1 80, 560 +\n80, and 480 \u00b1 92 in animals treated with three, two, or one\ndose, respectively), and animals were protected against subse-\nquent challenge.\nFrom this study it was found that one dose given 1 h p.i. was\nsufficient to limit virus replication and inflammation in the\nupper respiratory tract and eliminate fever. Therefore, in\nsubsequent studies, single-dose treatment regimens were used.\nEffect of time of dosing. To determine the latest that the\ncompound could be given but still control the infection, groups\nof virus-inoculated ferrets were injected with 40 mg of the\nprodrug 2'-FluorodDAP per kg at 4, 12, or 24 h post-virus\nexposure. Although previous work with mice indicated that the\nprodrug and 2'-FluorodGuo were interchangeable, a group of\nvirus-inoculated ferrets was also injected with 40 mg of 2'-\nFluorodGuo per kg at 4 h post-virus exposure for comparison.\nAs described above, animals treated with 2'-FluorodGuo at\n1 h post-virus exposure shed only low levels of virus, and both\npeak virus titers and total virus shed (virus index) were\nsignificantly reduced (P < 0.001) in comparison with those\nvalues for untreated controls (Table 2). Virus levels were also\nsignificantly reduced when compound, both 2'-FluorodDAP\nand 2'-FluorodGuo, was given at 4 h post-virus exposure, but\n2'-FluorodDAP was less effective when it was given at 12 h\npost-virus exposure, although virus levels were still significantly\nreduced (P < 0.01), and it was too late to influence the course\nof the infection when it was given at 24 h post-virus exposure\n(Table 2). The effects on the nasal inflammatory cell response\nwere similar to those on nasal virus levels, but fever was\nobserved in all groups given compound later than 1 h, and in\nmost cases this fever was not significantly less than that in\ncontrol animals (Table 2). Considering the high level of virus\nchallenge (106 EID50s) required to produce consistent infec-\ntion in ferrets, these results are encouraging and indicate that\nthese inhibitors have considerable therapeutic potential. 1n\nhumans 0.6 to 50% tissue culture infective doses 3.0 are\nsufficient for infection (1).\nEffect of dose. To ascertain the minimum effective dose,\ngroups of infected ferrets were inoculated with single doses of\n20, 10, or 5 mg of 2'-FluorodDAP per kg at 1 h post-virus\nexposure. Control virus-inoculated, untreated animals showed\nresponses similar to those in the animals in the experiments\ndescribed above, and all three dose levels significantly reduced\nvirus replication, nasal inflammatory responses, and fever\n(Table 3). While the magnitudes of these responses did not\ndiffer significantly from those observed in ferrets treated with\n40 mg/kg, virus was detectable over longer periods of time as\nthe dose of compound was reduced.\nLevels of 2'-FluorodGuo in plasma were 5.1 and 8.2, 16.9\nand 18.4, and 40.8 and 42.4 p.M, respectively, for plasma from\neach of two virus-inoculated animals taken 15 min after\ninjection with doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg of compound per kg.\nEffect against influenza virus B/Singapore/222/79. To deter-\nmine whether 2'-FluorodDAP was effective against influenza B\nvirus, four animals were inoculated with 106 EID50s of B/\nSingapore/222/79, and another group of four inoculated ferrets\nwas treated with the compound 1 h later. Virus-inoculated,\nuntreated animals started shedding virus within 24 h of inoc-\nulation, which peaked at 105 PFU/ml at 48 h p.i. but which\nremained at relatively high levels (between 103.0 and 104.0\nPFU/ml) until 104 h p.i., when the levels declined rapidly (Fig.\nlB-a). Virus levels in treated, virus-inoculated animals were\nconsiderably reduced initially but peaked at levels (104.8 PFU/\nml) similar to those in untreated animals at 78 h post-virus\nexposure before declining (Fig. lB-a); the overall virus index\nfor treated animals was significantly reduced in comparison\nwith those for untreated animals (P < 0.01). Fever and nasal\ninflammation were also significantly reduced (Fig. lB-b and\nB-c). However, the efficacy of 2'-FluorodDAP was not as great\nagainst influenza B virus as it was against influenza A virus,\n1866\nNOTES\n\nNOTES\n1867\nTABLE 3.

Replication of virus in the lower respiratory tract was also reduced >100-fold, but three\ndoses were required to prevent replication in the lungs. In ferrets infected with influenza B virus, single-dose\ntreatment (40 mg/kg given intraperitoneally) produced a similar but reduced response in comparison with that\nin ferrets infected with influenza A virus, indicating that dosing was not optimal for this virus.\nRecently, a number of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluororibosides have been\nreported to possess significant inhibitory activities against\ninfluenza A and B viruses in vitro in cells and human tracheal\norgan cultures and in vivo in mice (9, 10). The most potent,\n2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine\n(2'-FluorodGuo),\nwas\nsignifi-\ncantly more efficacious than amantadine or ribavirin, as mea-\nsured by a reduction in the titers of virus in mouse lungs when\nthe drug was given as multiple therapeutic doses (9) or as a\nsingle therapeutic dose (10).\nOn the basis of the encouraging data on drug efficacy in\nmice, we progressed to studies of efficacy in ferrets, a more\ncomparable model for humans (3, 5, 11, 12). In ferrets, we were\nable to examine the ability of 2'-FluorodGuo and a prodrug,\n2,6-diaminopurine-2'-fluororiboside (2'-FluorodDAP), to in-\nhibit viral replication in the respiratory tract and, consequently,\nto affect the expression of respiratory and constitutional signs\nas judged by an influx of leukocytes into the respiratory tract\nand the production of fever, respectively.\nFerrets were inoculated with influenza A virus, clone 7a\n(H3N2; virulent), of the reassortant virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34-\nA/England/939/69 or with influenza virus B/Singapore/222/79\nas described previously (11). Animals were treated with the\ncompounds, which were made up as fine suspensions in 1%\nTriton, by the intraperitoneal route for ease of administration\nat concentrations of 40, 20, 10, or 5 mg/kg of body weight. To\nmonitor the levels of the compounds in plasma, certain animals\nwere bled by cardiac puncture under halothane anesthesia 15\nmin after dosing, and the compounds were recovered by\nsolid-phase extraction by using 100-mg Analytichem Bond Elut\nC18 cartridges, which were washed with distilled water, and the\ncompounds were eluted with 50% (vol/vol) methanol-water.\nSamples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatog-\nraphy by using a SGE glass-lined column packed with 5 ,um\nODS-2 and monitored by UV detection at 250 nm. Detailed\npharmacokinetic studies have been carried out previously in\nmice, and 15 min after dosing proved to be the optimal\nsampling time (10).

Monitoring for\nclinical signs of infection, that is, inflammatory cell counts and\ndetermination of pyrexia, was carried out as described previ-\nously, as were virus titrations in nasal washes and lung samples\n(7, 8, 11, 12). Virus titers were assayed by the allantoin-on-shell\n(egg-bit) or egg techniques (7, 8) or in Madin-Darby canine\nkidney (MDCK) cells (6).\nTo estimate immune protection, animals were challenged\nintranasally under ether anesthesia with 106 50% egg infective\ndoses (EID50s) of clone 7a 4 weeks after primary virus\ninoculation, and the level of protection was assessed as de-\nscribed previously (4).\nEffect against influenza A virus reassortant clone 7a. Initial\nstudies in ferrets were designed on the basis of previous studies\nin mice (9, 10) to determine the minimum number of doses\nrequired to limit infection. Ferrets were inoculated with 106\nEID50s of clone 7a and were divided into groups of four which\nwere treated intraperitoneally with three doses of 40 mg of\ncompound 2'-FluorodGuo per kg at 1, 8, and 24 h post-virus\nexposure, two doses at 1 and 24 h post-virus exposure, and 1\ndose at 1 h post-virus exposure. Treated ferrets were then\ncompared with untreated virus-inoculated controls. Virus titers\nin nasal washes and lungs, pyrexia, and the nasal inflammatory\nresponse were monitored at intervals after infection. Data\nfrom the single-dose study are plotted in Fig. 1, and the results\ncalculated as mean level of virus in nasal washes and lungs, and\ncell and fever indices (determined from areas under individual\ncurves) are shown for all dosing regimes in Table 1.\nIn untreated animals (Fig. 1), virus peaked at 30 h (10-55\n50% egg-bit infective doses [EBID50s]/ml) and then declined\nrapidly, with a second small peak of virus shedding occurring\n96 h postinoculation (p.i.) (1025 EBID50s/ml) (Fig. lA-a). In\ncontrast,\nin animals treated with one dose of 40 mg of\n2'-FluorodGuo per kg at 1 h post-virus exposure, no initial\nvirus peak was detectable but a small peak occurred at 60 h\npost-virus exposure; this small peak was about 200-fold less\n(1035 EBID50s/ml) than the peak in the untreated virus-\ninoculated animals (Fig. lA-a). Similar statistically significant\nreductions in virus titers in nasal washes were seen in animals\ntreated with two or three doses of compound post-virus\nexposure (Table 1).

One group was treated with 2'-FluorodGuo for comparison.\nMean of the mathematically calculated areas under the curves for individual animals.\nThe statistical significance of differences in virus in nasal washes, cell, and fever indices were tested by the Student t test.\nd Standard errors of the mean are given in parentheses.\ntory cells in nasal washes, were also considerably reduced (Fig.\nlA-c). In untreated, virus-inoculated animals, the inflamma-\ntory cellular response started at about 24 h p.i., reached a\nmaximum of 10' cells at 54 h after inoculation, and remained\napproximately 100-fold above preinfection levels up to 168 h\np.i. (Fig. lA-c). Virus-inoculated animals treated with three,\ntwo, or one dose of 2'-FluorodGuo showed a significantly\nreduced response (Fig. lA-c; Table 1).\nVirus (10 *' EID50s) was detected in the lungs of untreated\nvirus-infected animals at 72 h p.i.; the titer rose to a peak of\n1061 EID50s at 120 h p.i. and declined rapidly thereafter,\nbarely reaching detectable levels (1026 EID50s) by 192 h p.i.\nPeak virus titers were reduced about 100-fold in animals\ntreated with one and two doses of 40 mg of 2'-FluorodGuo per\nkg and were barely detectable in animals treated with three\ndoses (Table 1). Viruses present in the lungs of treated animals\nhad susceptibilities to 2'-FluorodGuo similar to that of the\ninoculum virus when assayed by plaque reduction in MDCK\ncells.\nThe levels of the compound in plasma for six individual\nvirus-inoculated ferrets at 15 min after injection of the com-\npound ranged from 19.0 to 76.5 ,uM (mean, 43.2 \u00b1 9.1 ,uM),\nwhich is well above the 50% inhibitory concentration of 6.9 ,uM\n2'-FluorodGuo for clone 7a as determined in MDCK cells (9).\nDespite the reduced level of replication in both the upper\nand lower respiratory tracts of the virus-inoculated treated\nanimals, the hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers deter-\nmined by standard methods (2) were similar to those in\ncontrols (mean, 560 \u00b1 80 in comparison with 240 \u00b1 80, 560 +\n80, and 480 \u00b1 92 in animals treated with three, two, or one\ndose, respectively), and animals were protected against subse-\nquent challenge.\nFrom this study it was found that one dose given 1 h p.i. was\nsufficient to limit virus replication and inflammation in the\nupper respiratory tract and eliminate fever. Therefore, in\nsubsequent studies, single-dose treatment regimens were used.\nEffect of time of dosing. To determine the latest that the\ncompound could be given but still control the infection, groups\nof virus-inoculated ferrets were injected with 40 mg of the\nprodrug 2'-FluorodDAP per kg at 4, 12, or 24 h post-virus\nexposure. Although previous work with mice indicated that the\nprodrug and 2'-FluorodGuo were interchangeable, a group of\nvirus-inoculated ferrets was also injected with 40 mg of 2'-\nFluorodGuo per kg at 4 h post-virus exposure for comparison.\nAs described above, animals treated with 2'-FluorodGuo at\n1 h post-virus exposure shed only low levels of virus, and both\npeak virus titers and total virus shed (virus index) were\nsignificantly reduced (P < 0.001) in comparison with those\nvalues for untreated controls (Table 2). Virus levels were also\nsignificantly reduced when compound, both 2'-FluorodDAP\nand 2'-FluorodGuo, was given at 4 h post-virus exposure, but\n2'-FluorodDAP was less effective when it was given at 12 h\npost-virus exposure, although virus levels were still significantly\nreduced (P < 0.01), and it was too late to influence the course\nof the infection when it was given at 24 h post-virus exposure\n(Table 2). The effects on the nasal inflammatory cell response\nwere similar to those on nasal virus levels, but fever was\nobserved in all groups given compound later than 1 h, and in\nmost cases this fever was not significantly less than that in\ncontrol animals (Table 2). Considering the high level of virus\nchallenge (106 EID50s) required to produce consistent infec-\ntion in ferrets, these results are encouraging and indicate that\nthese inhibitors have considerable therapeutic potential. In\nhumans 0.6 to 50% tissue culture infective doses 3.0 are\nsufficient for infection (1).\nEffect of dose. To ascertain the minimum effective dose,\ngroups of infected ferrets were inoculated with single doses of\n20, 10, or 5 mg of 2'-FluorodDAP per kg at 1 h post-virus\nexposure. Control virus-inoculated, untreated animals showed\nresponses similar to those in the animals in the experiments\ndescribed above, and all three dose levels significantly reduced\nvirus replication, nasal inflammatory responses, and fever\n(Table 3). While the magnitudes of these responses did not\ndiffer significantly from those observed in ferrets treated with\n40 mg/kg, virus was detectable over longer periods of time as\nthe dose of compound was reduced.\nLevels of 2'-FluorodGuo in plasma were 5.1 and 8.2, 16.9\nand 18.4, and 40.8 and 42.4 p.M, respectively, for plasma from\neach of two virus-inoculated animals taken 15 min after\ninjection with doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg of compound per kg.\nEffect against influenza virus B/Singapore/222/79. To deter-\nmine whether 2'-FluorodDAP was effective against influenza B\nvirus, four animals were inoculated with 106 EID50s of B/\nSingapore/222/79, and another group of four inoculated ferrets\nwas treated with the compound 1 h later. Virus-inoculated,\nuntreated animals started shedding virus within 24 h of inoc-\nulation, which peaked at 105 PFU/ml at 48 h p.i. but which\nremained at relatively high levels (between 103.0 and 104.0\nPFU/ml) until 104 h p.i., when the levels declined rapidly (Fig.\nlB-a). Virus levels in treated, virus-inoculated animals were\nconsiderably reduced initially but peaked at levels (104.8 PFU/\nml) similar to those in untreated animals at 78 h post-virus\nexposure before declining (Fig. lB-a); the overall virus index\nfor treated animals was significantly reduced in comparison\nwith those for untreated animals (P < 0.01). Fever and nasal\ninflammation were also significantly reduced (Fig. lB-b and\nB-c). However, the efficacy of 2'-FluorodDAP was not as great\nagainst influenza B virus as it was against influenza A virus,\n1866\nNOTES\n\nNOTES\n1867\nTABLE 3.

Replication of virus in the lower respiratory tract was also reduced >100-fold, but three\ndoses were required to prevent replication in the lungs. In ferrets infected with influenza B virus, single-dose\ntreatment (40 mg/kg given intraperitoneally) produced a similar but reduced response in comparison with that\nin ferrets infected with influenza A virus, indicating that dosing was not optimal for this virus.\nRecently, a number of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluororibosides have been\nreported to possess significant inhibitory activities against\ninfluenza A and B viruses in vitro in cells and human tracheal\norgan cultures and in vivo in mice (9, 10). The most potent,\n2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine\n(2'-FluorodGuo),\nwas\nsignifi-\ncantly more efficacious than amantadine or ribavirin, as mea-\nsured by a reduction in the titers of virus in mouse lungs when\nthe drug was given as multiple therapeutic doses (9) or as a\nsingle therapeutic dose (10).\nOn the basis of the encouraging data on drug efficacy in\nmice, we progressed to studies of efficacy in ferrets, a more\ncomparable model for humans (3, 5, 11, 12).

Monitoring for\nclinical signs of infection, that is, inflammatory cell counts and\ndetermination of pyrexia, was carried out as described previ-\nously, as were virus titrations in nasal washes and lung samples\n(7, 8, 11, 12). Virus titers were assayed by the allantoin-on-shell\n(egg-bit) or egg techniques (7, 8) or in Madin-Darby canine\nkidney (MDCK) cells (6).\nTo estimate immune protection, animals were challenged\nintranasally under ether anesthesia with 106 50% egg infective\ndoses (EID50s) of clone 7a 4 weeks after primary virus\ninoculation, and the level of protection was assessed as de-\nscribed previously (4).\nEffect against influenza A virus reassortant clone 7a. Initial\nstudies in ferrets were designed on the basis of previous studies\nin mice (9, 10) to determine the minimum number of doses\nrequired to limit infection. Ferrets were inoculated with 106\nEID50s of clone 7a and were divided into groups of four which\nwere treated intraperitoneally with three doses of 40 mg of\ncompound 2'-FluorodGuo per kg at 1, 8, and 24 h post-virus\nexposure, two doses at 1 and 24 h post-virus exposure, and 1\ndose at 1 h post-virus exposure. Treated ferrets were then\ncompared with untreated virus-inoculated controls. Virus titers\nin nasal washes and lungs, pyrexia, and the nasal inflammatory\nresponse were monitored at intervals after infection. Data\nfrom the single-dose study are plotted in Fig. 1, and the results\ncalculated as mean level of virus in nasal washes and lungs, and\ncell and fever indices (determined from areas under individual\ncurves) are shown for all dosing regimes in Table 1.\nIn untreated animals (Fig. 1), virus peaked at 30 h (10-55\n50% egg-bit infective doses [EBID50s]/ml) and then declined\nrapidly, with a second small peak of virus shedding occurring\n96 h postinoculation (p.i.) (1025 EBID50s/ml) (Fig. lA-a). In\ncontrast,\nin animals treated with one dose of 40 mg of\n2'-FluorodGuo per kg at 1 h post-virus exposure, no initial\nvirus peak was detectable but a small peak occurred at 60 h\npost-virus exposure; this small peak was about 200-fold less\n(1035 EBID50s/ml) than the peak in the untreated virus-\ninoculated animals (Fig. lA-a). Similar statistically significant\nreductions in virus titers in nasal washes were seen in animals\ntreated with two or three doses of compound post-virus\nexposure (Table 1).

Mean virus titers in nasal washes (a), mean rise in rectal temperatures (b), and mean cell counts (c) were monitored in control\nuntreated (0) and treated (0) animals.\nand reduced in treated animals compared with that in un-\ntreated animals.\nConstitutional signs represented by febrile responses were\nalso suppressed in treated, virus-inoculated animals.

Animals treated with one, two,\nor three doses of 40 mg of 2'-FluorodGuo per kg showed little\nor no febrile response (Fig. lA-b; Table 1).

One group was treated with 2'-FluorodGuo for comparison.\nMean of the mathematically calculated areas under the curves for individual animals.\nThe statistical significance of differences in virus in nasal washes, cell, and fever indices were tested by the Student t test.\nd Standard errors of the mean are given in parentheses.\ntory cells in nasal washes, were also considerably reduced (Fig.\nlA-c). In untreated, virus-inoculated animals, the inflamma-\ntory cellular response started at about 24 h p.i., reached a\nmaximum of 10' cells at 54 h after inoculation, and remained\napproximately 100-fold above preinfection levels up to 168 h\np.i. (Fig. lA-c). Virus-inoculated animals treated with three,\ntwo, or one dose of 2'-FluorodGuo showed a significantly\nreduced response (Fig. lA-c; Table 1).\nVirus (10 *' EID50s) was detected in the lungs of untreated\nvirus-infected animals at 72 h p.i.; the titer rose to a peak of\n1061 EID50s at 120 h p.i. and declined rapidly thereafter,\nbarely reaching detectable levels (1026 EID50s) by 192 h p.i.\nPeak virus titers were reduced about 100-fold in animals\ntreated with one and two doses of 40 mg of 2'-FluorodGuo per\nkg and were barely detectable in animals treated with three\ndoses (Table 1). Viruses present in the lungs of treated animals\nhad susceptibilities to 2'-FluorodGuo similar to that of the\ninoculum virus when assayed by plaque reduction in MDCK\ncells.\nThe levels of the compound in plasma for six individual\nvirus-inoculated ferrets at 15 min after injection of the com-\npound ranged from 19.0 to 76.5 ,uM (mean, 43.2 \u00b1 9.1 ,uM),\nwhich is well above the 50% inhibitory concentration of 6.9 ,uM\n2'-FluorodGuo for clone 7a as determined in MDCK cells (9).\nDespite the reduced level of replication in both the upper\nand lower respiratory tracts of the virus-inoculated treated\nanimals, the hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers deter-\nmined by standard methods (2) were similar to those in\ncontrols (mean, 560 \u00b1 80 in comparison with 240 \u00b1 80, 560 +\n80, and 480 \u00b1 92 in animals treated with three, two, or one\ndose, respectively), and animals were protected against subse-\nquent challenge.\nFrom this study it was found that one dose given 1 h p.i. was\nsufficient to limit virus replication and inflammation in the\nupper respiratory tract and eliminate fever. Therefore, in\nsubsequent studies, single-dose treatment regimens were used.\nEffect of time of dosing. To determine the latest that the\ncompound could be given but still control the infection, groups\nof virus-inoculated ferrets were injected with 40 mg of the\nprodrug 2'-FluorodDAP per kg at 4, 12, or 24 h post-virus\nexposure. Although previous work with mice indicated that the\nprodrug and 2'-FluorodGuo were interchangeable, a group of\nvirus-inoculated ferrets was also injected with 40 mg of 2'-\nFluorodGuo per kg at 4 h post-virus exposure for comparison.\nAs described above, animals treated with 2'-FluorodGuo at\n1 h post-virus exposure shed only low levels of virus, and both\npeak virus titers and total virus shed (virus index) were\nsignificantly reduced (P < 0.001) in comparison with those\nvalues for untreated controls (Table 2). Virus levels were also\nsignificantly reduced when compound, both 2'-FluorodDAP\nand 2'-FluorodGuo, was given at 4 h post-virus exposure, but\n2'-FluorodDAP was less effective when it was given at 12 h\npost-virus exposure, although virus levels were still significantly\nreduced (P < 0.01), and it was too late to influence the course\nof the infection when it was given at 24 h post-virus exposure\n(Table 2). The effects on the nasal inflammatory cell response\nwere similar to those on nasal virus levels, but fever was\nobserved in all groups given compound later than 1 h, and in\nmost cases this fever was not significantly less than that in\ncontrol animals (Table 2). Considering the high level of virus\nchallenge (106 EID50s) required to produce consistent infec-\ntion in ferrets, these results are encouraging and indicate that\nthese inhibitors have considerable therapeutic potential. In\nhumans 0.6 to 50% tissue culture infective doses 3.0 are\nsufficient for infection (1).\nEffect of dose. To ascertain the minimum effective dose,\ngroups of infected ferrets were inoculated with single doses of\n20, 10, or 5 mg of 2'-FluorodDAP per kg at 1 h post-virus\nexposure. Control virus-inoculated, untreated animals showed\nresponses similar to those in the animals in the experiments\ndescribed above, and all three dose levels significantly reduced\nvirus replication, nasal inflammatory responses, and fever\n(Table 3). While the magnitudes of these responses did not\ndiffer significantly from those observed in ferrets treated with\n40 mg/kg, virus was detectable over longer periods of time as\nthe dose of compound was reduced.\nLevels of 2'-FluorodGuo in plasma were 5.1 and 8.2, 16.9\nand 18.4, and 40.8 and 42.4 p.M, respectively, for plasma from\neach of two virus-inoculated animals taken 15 min after\ninjection with doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg of compound per kg.\nEffect against influenza virus B/Singapore/222/79. To deter-\nmine whether 2'-FluorodDAP was effective against influenza B\nvirus, four animals were inoculated with 106 EID50s of B/\nSingapore/222/79, and another group of four inoculated ferrets\nwas treated with the compound 1 h later. Virus-inoculated,\nuntreated animals started shedding virus within 24 h of inoc-\nulation, which peaked at 105 PFU/ml at 48 h p.i. but which\nremained at relatively high levels (between 103.0 and 104.0\nPFU/ml) until 104 h p.i., when the levels declined rapidly (Fig.\nlB-a). Virus levels in treated, virus-inoculated animals were\nconsiderably reduced initially but peaked at levels (104.8 PFU/\nml) similar to those in untreated animals at 78 h post-virus\nexposure before declining (Fig. lB-a); the overall virus index\nfor treated animals was significantly reduced in comparison\nwith those for untreated animals (P < 0.01). Fever and nasal\ninflammation were also significantly reduced (Fig. lB-b and\nB-c). However, the efficacy of 2'-FluorodDAP was not as great\nagainst influenza B virus as it was against influenza A virus,\n1866\nNOTES\n\nNOTES\n1867\nTABLE 3.

Replication of virus in the lower respiratory tract was also reduced >100-fold, but three\ndoses were required to prevent replication in the lungs. 1n ferrets infected with influenza B virus, single-dose\ntreatment (40 mg/kg given intraperitoneally) produced a similar but reduced response in comparison with that\nin ferrets infected with influenza A virus, indicating that dosing was not optimal for this virus.\nRecently, a number of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluororibosides have been\nreported to possess significant inhibitory activities against\ninfluenza A and B viruses in vitro in cells and human tracheal\norgan cultures and in vivo in mice (9, 10). The most potent,\n2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine\n(2'-FluorodGuo),\nwas\nsignifi-\ncantly more efficacious than amantadine or ribavirin, as mea-\nsured by a reduction in the titers of virus in mouse lungs when\nthe drug was given as multiple therapeutic doses (9) or as a\nsingle therapeutic dose (10).\nOn the basis of the encouraging data on drug efficacy in\nmice, we progressed to studies of efficacy in ferrets, a more\ncomparable model for humans (3, 5, 11, 12). 1n ferrets, we were\nable to examine the ability of 2'-FluorodGuo and a prodrug,\n2,6-diaminopurine-2'-fluororiboside (2'-FluorodDAP), to in-\nhibit viral replication in the respiratory tract and, consequently,\nto affect the expression of respiratory and constitutional signs\nas judged by an influx of leukocytes into the respiratory tract\nand the production of fever, respectively.\nFerrets were inoculated with influenza A virus, clone 7a\n(H3N2; virulent), of the reassortant virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34-\nA/England/939/69 or with influenza virus B/Singapore/222/79\nas described previously (11).

Monitoring for\nclinical signs of infection, that is, inflammatory cell counts and\ndetermination of pyrexia, was carried out as described previ-\nously, as were virus titrations in nasal washes and lung samples\n(7, 8, 11, 12). Virus titers were assayed by the allantoin-on-shell\n(egg-bit) or egg techniques (7, 8) or in Madin-Darby canine\nkidney (MDCK) cells (6).\nTo estimate immune protection, animals were challenged\nintranasally under ether anesthesia with 106 50% egg infective\ndoses (EID50s) of clone 7a 4 weeks after primary virus\ninoculation, and the level of protection was assessed as de-\nscribed previously (4).\nEffect against influenza A virus reassortant clone 7a. 1nitial\nstudies in ferrets were designed on the basis of previous studies\nin mice (9, 10) to determine the minimum number of doses\nrequired to limit infection. Ferrets were inoculated with 106\nEID50s of clone 7a and were divided into groups of four which\nwere treated intraperitoneally with three doses of 40 mg of\ncompound 2'-FluorodGuo per kg at 1, 8, and 24 h post-virus\nexposure, two doses at 1 and 24 h post-virus exposure, and 1\ndose at 1 h post-virus exposure. Treated ferrets were then\ncompared with untreated virus-inoculated controls.

Similar statistically significant\nreductions in virus titers in nasal washes were seen in animals\ntreated with two or three doses of compound post-virus\nexposure (Table 1).

One group was treated with 2'-FluorodGuo for comparison.\nMean of the mathematically calculated areas under the curves for individual animals.\nThe statistical significance of differences in virus in nasal washes, cell, and fever indices were tested by the Student t test.\nd Standard errors of the mean are given in parentheses.\ntory cells in nasal washes, were also considerably reduced (Fig.\nlA-c). 1n untreated, virus-inoculated animals, the inflamma-\ntory cellular response started at about 24 h p.i., reached a\nmaximum of 10' cells at 54 h after inoculation, and remained\napproximately 100-fold above preinfection levels up to 168 h\np.i. (Fig. lA-c). Virus-inoculated animals treated with three,\ntwo, or one dose of 2'-FluorodGuo showed a significantly\nreduced response (Fig. lA-c; Table 1).\nVirus (10 *' EID50s) was detected in the lungs of untreated\nvirus-infected animals at 72 h p.i.; the titer rose to a peak of\n1061 EID50s at 120 h p.i. and declined rapidly thereafter,\nbarely reaching detectable levels (1026 EID50s) by 192 h p.i.\nPeak virus titers were reduced about 100-fold in animals\ntreated with one and two doses of 40 mg of 2'-FluorodGuo per\nkg and were barely detectable in animals treated with three\ndoses (Table 1). Viruses present in the lungs of treated animals\nhad susceptibilities to 2'-FluorodGuo similar to that of the\ninoculum virus when assayed by plaque reduction in MDCK\ncells.\nThe levels of the compound in plasma for six individual\nvirus-inoculated ferrets at 15 min after injection of the com-\npound ranged from 19.0 to 76.5 ,uM (mean, 43.2 \u00b1 9.1 ,uM),\nwhich is well above the 50% inhibitory concentration of 6.9 ,uM\n2'-FluorodGuo for clone 7a as determined in MDCK cells (9).\nDespite the reduced level of replication in both the upper\nand lower respiratory tracts of the virus-inoculated treated\nanimals, the hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers deter-\nmined by standard methods (2) were similar to those in\ncontrols (mean, 560 \u00b1 80 in comparison with 240 \u00b1 80, 560 +\n80, and 480 \u00b1 92 in animals treated with three, two, or one\ndose, respectively), and animals were protected against subse-\nquent challenge.\nFrom this study it was found that one dose given 1 h p.i. was\nsufficient to limit virus replication and inflammation in the\nupper respiratory tract and eliminate fever. Therefore, in\nsubsequent studies, single-dose treatment regimens were used.\nEffect of time of dosing. To determine the latest that the\ncompound could be given but still control the infection, groups\nof virus-inoculated ferrets were injected with 40 mg of the\nprodrug 2'-FluorodDAP per kg at 4, 12, or 24 h post-virus\nexposure. Although previous work with mice indicated that the\nprodrug and 2'-FluorodGuo were interchangeable, a group of\nvirus-inoculated ferrets was also injected with 40 mg of 2'-\nFluorodGuo per kg at 4 h post-virus exposure for comparison.\nAs described above, animals treated with 2'-FluorodGuo at\n1 h post-virus exposure shed only low levels of virus, and both\npeak virus titers and total virus shed (virus index) were\nsignificantly reduced (P < 0.001) in comparison with those\nvalues for untreated controls (Table 2). Virus levels were also\nsignificantly reduced when compound, both 2'-FluorodDAP\nand 2'-FluorodGuo, was given at 4 h post-virus exposure, but\n2'-FluorodDAP was less effective when it was given at 12 h\npost-virus exposure, although virus levels were still significantly\nreduced (P < 0.01), and it was too late to influence the course\nof the infection when it was given at 24 h post-virus exposure\n(Table 2). The effects on the nasal inflammatory cell response\nwere similar to those on nasal virus levels, but fever was\nobserved in all groups given compound later than 1 h, and in\nmost cases this fever was not significantly less than that in\ncontrol animals (Table 2). Considering the high level of virus\nchallenge (106 EID50s) required to produce consistent infec-\ntion in ferrets, these results are encouraging and indicate that\nthese inhibitors have considerable therapeutic potential. 1n\nhumans 0.6 to 50% tissue culture infective doses 3.0 are\nsufficient for infection (1).\nEffect of dose. To ascertain the minimum effective dose,\ngroups of infected ferrets were inoculated with single doses of\n20, 10, or 5 mg of 2'-FluorodDAP per kg at 1 h post-virus\nexposure. Control virus-inoculated, untreated animals showed\nresponses similar to those in the animals in the experiments\ndescribed above, and all three dose levels significantly reduced\nvirus replication, nasal inflammatory responses, and fever\n(Table 3). While the magnitudes of these responses did not\ndiffer significantly from those observed in ferrets treated with\n40 mg/kg, virus was detectable over longer periods of time as\nthe dose of compound was reduced.\nLevels of 2'-FluorodGuo in plasma were 5.1 and 8.2, 16.9\nand 18.4, and 40.8 and 42.4 p.M, respectively, for plasma from\neach of two virus-inoculated animals taken 15 min after\ninjection with doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg of compound per kg.\nEffect against influenza virus B/Singapore/222/79. To deter-\nmine whether 2'-FluorodDAP was effective against influenza B\nvirus, four animals were inoculated with 106 EID50s of B/\nSingapore/222/79, and another group of four inoculated ferrets\nwas treated with the compound 1 h later. Virus-inoculated,\nuntreated animals started shedding virus within 24 h of inoc-\nulation, which peaked at 105 PFU/ml at 48 h p.i. but which\nremained at relatively high levels (between 103.0 and 104.0\nPFU/ml) until 104 h p.i., when the levels declined rapidly (Fig.\nlB-a). Virus levels in treated, virus-inoculated animals were\nconsiderably reduced initially but peaked at levels (104.8 PFU/\nml) similar to those in untreated animals at 78 h post-virus\nexposure before declining (Fig. lB-a); the overall virus index\nfor treated animals was significantly reduced in comparison\nwith those for untreated animals (P < 0.01). Fever and nasal\ninflammation were also significantly reduced (Fig. lB-b and\nB-c). However, the efficacy of 2'-FluorodDAP was not as great\nagainst influenza B virus as it was against influenza A virus,\n1866\nNOTES\n\nNOTES\n1867\nTABLE 3.

Experimental studies showed that while HIV-positive\nsera neutralize HIV infection, the addition of fresh complement abrogated neutralization and could even cause\nenhancement. Enhancement was blocked by anti-complement receptor 2 antibodies, and infection under\nenhancing conditions could be blocked by soluble CD4. Antibody-dependent complement-mediated enhance-\nment (C\u2019ADE) was dependent on the alternative complement activation pathway, as factor B-de\ufb01cient serum\ncould enhance only after the addition of factor B. The observed enhancement was also antibody dependent,\nsince the addition of antibodies increased the level of enhancement. Under C\u2019ADE conditions, infection reached\na plateau within 5 min and was not caused by activation of cells by factors in the human serum. On the\ncontrary, preincubation of cells with complement decreased the level of enhancement. A theoretical model of\nHIV infection in vitro which exhibited similar enhancement in an antibody- and complement concentration-\ndependent way was developed. Model studies indicated that the enhanced infection process could be explained\nby the fact that virions, because of complement deposition on the surface, bind more ef\ufb01ciently to cells. The\nmodel also indicated that the saturation of the enhanced infection process seen after a few minutes could be\ncaused by saturation of the complement receptors. The effect of neutralizing antibodies can thus be overcome\nby the enhancing effect of complement that facilitates the contact between gp120 and CD4. These studies\ndemonstrate that the main features of the complement-dependent enhancement phenomenon can be under-\nstood in terms of a simple mathematical model.\nComplement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement\n(C\u2019ADE) has been found in vitro both in sera from three of\nfour volunteers vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia virus ex-\npressing human immunode\ufb01ciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp160\nand boosted with baculovirus-derived recombinant gp160\n(rgp160) (20) and in 25% of healthy adults vaccinated with\nHIV-1 rgp160 (8). 1t is therefore possible that C\u2019ADE reduces\nor even reverses vaccine ef\ufb01cacy. HIV and HIV-infected cells\neither in conjunction with or independent of antibody can\nactivate the complement cascade by the classical or the alter-\nnative pathway (7). The complement system is chronically ac-\ntivated throughout the infection in vivo, probably resulting in\nthe reduced levels of complement found in HIV-infected pa-\ntients by several groups (7, 24). C\u2019ADE and complement-me-\ndiated antibody-independent enhancement (C\u2019AIDE) may\ncontribute to the in vivo pathogenesis of HIV infection. This\nhypothesis is supported by the \ufb01ndings that 10 to 50% of\nhuman CD41 T lymphocytes express complement receptor 2\n(CR2) and that this fraction is reduced during HIV infection,\nsuggesting that these CD41 CR21 T cells are selectively in-\nfected and killed either by direct cytopathic effects of HIV or\nby HIV-speci\ufb01c immunological mechanisms (14). Comple-\nment-coated cells have also been shown to be more sensitive to\nattack by natural killer cells (37). Although it has been re-\nported in several instances (26, 34), viral neutralization by\ncomplement-mediated lysis is still controversial (7, 33). 1t is generally believed that C\u2019ADE requires complement\nreceptors and CD4 receptors (30, 35), since C\u2019ADE can be\nblocked by antibodies against CR2 (10, 31) and CR3 (28).\nComplement-mediated binding to target cells seems indepen-\ndent of CD4 (1, 21, 22), but infection is generally believed to\nrequire CD4 receptors (7, 10, 11, 22), although CD4-indepen-\ndent C\u2019ADE infection of MT-2 cells has been reported (3, 7).\nAt least three fundamentally different hypotheses can be\nproposed to explain the observed enhancement phenomena.\n(i) Antibodies and/or complement may increase adhesion of\nHIV to complement receptor-bearing cells. C3 fragments de-\nposited on either gp41 (29, 30) or other epitopes (13), classi-\ncally (normally antibody dependently) or alternatively (nor-\nmally antibody independently), could increase the binding of\nHIV to target cells possessing complement receptors (CR2 in\nthe case of MT-2 cells) and thereby facilitate the contact be-\ntween gp120 and cell-associated CD4, causing increased virus\nuptake (1) and provirus formation (15). (ii) Complement\nbound to virus may facilitate HIV-cell fusion. (iii) Comple-\nment deposited on HIV may have nonspeci\ufb01c stimulatory ef-\nfects on target cells, such as increasing cellular metabolism and\nvirus production. C3a and C5a, which stimulate many immune\ncells, are released during complement activation and could\nhave such effects. Alternatively, cells may also be stimulated by\nCR2 cross-linking or CR2 and CD4 cross-linking caused by\ncomplement deposition on cells (15). 1t is not trivial to predict the effect of antibodies and com-\nplement on HIV infection, since both have been shown to have\n* Corresponding author.

We have previously\nshown that antibody-dependent enhancement of HIV infection\nof U937 cells is well explained by a mathematical model based\non a hypothesis of increased adhesion of antibody-coated viri-\nons to target cells (19). 1n this study we have investigated the\nmechanisms of complement and antibody-dependent enhance-\nment of HIV 1IIB infection of MT-2 cells experimentally and\nexamined whether a mathematical model based on the ob-\nserved phenomena shows similar infection kinetics and anti-\nbody and complement dose dependence.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCells and virus. The human T-lymphoblastoid cell line used in the experiments\nwas MT-2, a human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-I)-transformed CD41\nand CR21 cell line (repository reference ADP014 obtained from the Medical\nResearch Council, MRC, London, England). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640\ncontaining 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 1U of penicillin per ml,\n20 mg of gentamicin per ml, and 100 1U of streptomycin (growth medium) at a\ndensity of 0.2 3 106 to 1.2 3 106 cells per ml, and maintained at 378C and 5%\nCO2. The HIV-1 laboratory strain HIV 1IIB (obtained from R. C. Gallo, Na-\ntional Cancer 1nstitute, Bethesda, Md.) was obtained as a supernatant from\nfreshly infected H9 cells (25). Supernatants were harvested, \ufb01ltered (pore size,\n0.45 mm), aliquotted, and stored at 2808 until use. The approximate 50% tissue\nculture infectious dose (TCID50) of HIV 1IIB was calculated by end point\ntitration with MT-2 cells by the method of Reed and Muench (27). Cells (5 3\n105) were inoculated with a \ufb01vefold dilution series of virus for 3 h and then\nextensively washed and cultured in quadruplicates of 5 3 104 cells. The HIV\nantigen concentrations in the supernatants were determined by HIV antigen\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described below.\nELISA for HIV antigen. Cell-free culture supernatants were examined for HIV\nantigen with a biotin-avidin potentiated double-antibody ELISA with human\nimmunoglobulin G against HIV, as described previously (12, 23). Each plate\nincluded a dilution series of a standard HIV antigen preparation, and optical\ndensities were expressed relative to this standard in arbitrary units.\nSera and reagents. Human serum used as a complement source (i.e., fresh\nhuman serum) was collected from an HIV-negative donor, aliquotted, and stored\nat 2808C until use. For neutralization, HIV 1IIB neutralizing serum (anti-HIV\nserum) was obtained from an HIV-positive patient. Serum was heat inactivated\nat 568C for 30 min, aliquotted, and stored at 2208C. Further, a serum sample was\nfreshly frozen and stored at 2808C to be used as an autologous complement\nsource. Factor B-de\ufb01cient serum, factor B, and a standard serum were purchased\nfrom Sigma (catalog numbers C0535, C4909, and C2038, respectively). Mono-\nclonal antibodies directed to CR2 (OKB7) and CD4 (OKT4) were purchased\nfrom Ortho Diagnostic Systems (Raritan, N.J.; catalog numbers 700720 and\n700420, respectively). All antibodies were dialyzed and \ufb01ltered (pore size, 0.22\nmm) before use.

To determine whether en-\nhancement occurred, a dilution series of anti-HIV serum was mixed with a\ndilution series of complement, and then 25 TCID50 of HIV 1IIB was added. After\npreincubation for 1 h at 378C, 5 3 105 MT-2 cells in growth medium were added\nand inoculated for 3 h at 378C. After an extensive washing, cells were resus-\npended in 2 ml of growth medium, and quadruplicates of 5 3 104 cells were\ntransferred to a 96-well cell culture plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), and plates\nwere incubated at 378C in 5% CO2 for 4 days. Supernatants were then harvested,\nand the HIV antigen concentration was measured.\nUnless otherwise stated, experiments were performed at least twice with iden-\ntical results. Means of quadruplicates were compared by a Student\u2019s t test (two-\nsided), allowing for unequal variances.\nModel formulation. The model is based on an in vitro system in which a\npopulation of target cells is infected by a population of HIV virions. 1t is an\nextension of the model proposed by Lund et al. (19) for antibody-mediated\nenhancement. Target cells and HIV are present in a supernatant in concentra-\ntions M and V, respectively. 1t is assumed that the concentration of target cells,\nM, is constant. The concentration of live virions is assumed to decay exponen-\ntially at a per capita rate, kn. The concentration of free live virions will also\ndiminish because of adhesion to the target cells at rate kaMV, thus giving rise to\na population of cell-bound virions, the concentration of which we shall denote as\nB. ka is the time-dependent association rate for the complex formation. The\nadhered virions will infect the cells at rate kiB, where ki is the infection rate per\nadhered virion. The concentration of cell-bound virions is also assumed to\ndecrease because of inactivation of the adhered virus at rate knB. The concen-\ntration of infected cells, which we shall denote as 1, rises at a rate equal to the\ninfection by cell-bound virions. 1t is assumed that the multiplicity of infection is\nlow. The above assumptions lead to the following equations:\ndB\ndt 5 kaMV 2 knB 2 kiB\n(1)\ndI\ndt 5 kiB\n(2)\ndV\ndt 5 2 kaMV 2 knV\n(3)\nThe rate of reaction, ka, can be calculated as the product of the maximum rate\nconstant for diffusion-limited aggregation, kd, and the probability of reaction, Pa.\nkd 5 4p(Dc 1 Dv) (rc 1 rv), where D and r are the diffusion constants and radii\nfor cells (subscript c) and virus (subscript v), respectively (4). The diffusion\nconstant for a particle with radius r is D 5 kT/6phr, where k is the Boltzman\nconstant, T is the absolute temperature, and h is the viscosity of the liquid in\nwhich the particle diffuses (4). As shown by Berg and Purcell (2), the probability\n(Pa) that a small molecule which has arrived at the surface of a cell will \ufb01nd a\nreceptor to bind to can be estimated as Pa 5 Nrr/(Nrr 1 prc). Here, N is the\nnumber of receptors on the cell surface to which the small molecule can bind,\nand rr is the functional radius of these receptors, i.e., the radius within which the\nsmall molecule has to be in order to bind to the receptor. A similar result was\nobtained by Shoup and Szabo (32) by a different approach in which they used the\nresult obtained by Collins and Kimball (5) that the forward reaction rate for a\nligand to a partly reacting sphere (ka) can be written as ka 5 kdk/(kd 1 k). By\nchoosing the Collins-Kimball constant k as N4Ds, where N is the number of\nreceptors on the cell surface and 4Ds is the reaction rate of a point ligand to a\nsingle reactive circular site with radius s on an in\ufb01nite unreactive surface, Shoup\nand Szabo immediately recover the result obtained by Berg and Purcell. To\nextend this \ufb01nding to a virus only partly covered with ligands for receptors on the\ncell, the Collins-Kimball constant is rede\ufb01ned as\nk 5 4DO\ni\nfiNisi\n(4)\nwhere fi is the fraction of the virus covered with ligand for the receptor of type\ni of which there are Ni on the cell surface. We thus obtain\nPa 5 O\ni~fiNisi!\nO\ni~fiNisi! 1 prc\n(5) 1n the case of HIV, the fraction of the surface that can bind to CD4 is\nfc 5\nNgrg\n2\n4rv\n2\n(6)\nwhere Ng and rg are the number and radius of gp120 molecules on the surface of\nan HIV virion, respectively. 1n this equation it is assumed that the binding of\nantibody to gp120 does not block the binding of gp120 to CD4. Correspondingly,\nthe fraction of the viral surface that can bind to complement receptors on the cell\nsurface is\nfk 5\nNkrk\n2ck\n4rv\n2\n(7)\nwhere Nk is the number of sites on the virus where complement can bind and rk\nis the radius of the complement receptor-binding site on deposited complement.\nck is the fraction of complement-binding sites occupied. The probability of\nadhesion (Pa) for this two-receptor system is\nPa 5\nfcNCDrCD 1 fkNCRrCR\nfcNCDrCD 1 fkNCRrCR 1 prc\n(8)\nHere rCD and rCR are the radii of the CD4 and the complement receptors,\nrespectively. Using a quasi-steady-state assumption, the numbers of free CD4\nreceptors (NCD) and complement receptors (NCR) are calculated as\nNCD 5 max~0,NCDt 2 bBNg/M!\n(9)\nNCR 5 max~0,NCRt 2 bBNkck/M!\n(10)\nwhere NCDt and NCRt are the average number of CD4 and CR2 receptors on the\ncells, respectively, and Nkck is the average number of complement molecules on\neach virion. 1n the above equation it is assumed that HIV binds to a cell with the\nligands on a contact surface which is assumed to cover a fraction (b) of the virion\nsurface.\nUnder the assumption of antibody excess, the fraction of gp120 molecules\ncomplexed with antibodies (ca) can be calculated as (6, 19).\nca 5\na\n1/km 1 a\n(11)\nwhere a is the concentration of antibodies and km is the equilibrium constant for\n2394\nLUND ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nthe reaction. Similarly, the fraction of complement-binding sites occupied (ck) is\nwritten\nck 5\nK\nk2/~k1 1 k2ca! 1 K\n(12)\nwhere K is the concentration of complement relative to the concentration of\ncomplement in normal human serum, and k2 is the dissociation rate for com-\nplement. The association rate is assumed to be a linear combination of an\nantibody-independent term (k1) and an antibody-dependent one (k2ca). Further-\nmore, we assume that HIV infects the cells that it has adhered to at a per capita\nrate (ki) proportional to the number of non-antibody-complexed gp120 mole-\ncules on the viral surface:\nki 5 ki0~1 2 ca!g\n(13)\nHere ki0 is the infection rate for a virion with no gp120 complexed with anti-\nbodies, and it is assumed that a fraction (g 5 1026) is infectious. This value of\ng lies in the range found by Layne et al. (17).\nThe parameters used in the simulations are listed in Table 1. Simulations of\nthe model were performed on a 66 MHz, 486 PC with a \ufb01ve-stage Runge-Kutta\nformula pair, RKN(3,4) (9), implemented in Borland Pascal (c) to solve the set\nof coupled nonlinear equations.\nRESULTS 1n vitro experiments. (i) Enhancement or inhibition de-\npends on concentrations of antibodies and complement. The\ninfection enhancement and inhibition assays were performed\nwith MT-2 cells. HIV 1IIB was preincubated with various con-\ncentrations of antibodies from heat-inactivated serum from an\nHIV-1-infected patient and complement from fresh serum\nfrom an uninfected donor. Table 2 and Fig. 1 show the effects\nof combinations of antibodies and complement on the infec-\ntion. When no complement was added, a dose-dependent neu-\ntralization as a function of the antibody concentration was seen\n(P , 0.01 when the dilution of antibody was less than 1:1,000).\nWhen no antibody was added, a dose-dependent enhancement\nas a function of the complement concentration was seen (P ,\n0.01 for a dilution of 1:10). For combinations of antibody and\ncomplement, the highest enhancement was seen for antibodies\nin a dilution of 1:1,000 and complement in a dilution of 1:10.\n(ii) Diluted complement from an HIV-1-infected patient can\nenhance infection. To evaluate whether fresh serum from an\nHIV-1-infected patient can enhance infection, combinations of\nfresh serum and heat-inactivated serum from the same HIV-\n1-infected patient were tested for enhancing and neutralizing\neffects. Table 3 and Fig. 2 show that when the dilution of serum\n(fresh plus heat inactivated) was lower than or equal to 1:10 or\nwhen only heat-inactivated serum was added, neutralization\nwas seen; otherwise, enhancement was seen.\n(iii) Enhancement can be blocked by heat inactivation of\nserum or by anti-CR2 antibodies. Enhancement is abrogated\nand antibody-mediated neutralization is regained during infec-\ntion with heat-inactivated sera, as seen in Fig. 2. To evaluate\nthe involvement of CR2, MT-2 cells were preincubated with\nthe monoclonal anti-CR2 antibody OKB7 for 1 h, and then\nFIG. 1. Three-dimensional plot of the relative level of infection.

The enhancement found\nwhen HIV was preincubated with complement in a dilution of\n1:100 and HIV-positive serum in a dilution of 1:1,000 relative\nto a control to which no serum was added was decreased\n2.7-fold by preincubating the cells with anti-CR2 antibodies\n(OKB7), but not with an indifferent antibody (OKT4), indicat-\ning that enhancement of MT-2 cells by HIV-1 1IIB is comple-\nment mediated and requires CR2.\n(iv) 1nfection under enhancing conditions can be blocked\nwith sCD4. To delineate whether gp120 binding to CD4 is\nnecessary for infection, we tested the effect on infection of\npreincubating HIV for 1 h with various dilutions of sCD4\ntogether with complement in a dilution of 1:100 and/or anti-\nbodies in a dilution of 1:1,000, before the addition of cells for\n3 h. Both with enhancing concentrations of antibodies and/or\ncomplement and with the control, a dose-dependent neutral-\nizing effect was seen (Fig. 3). Thus, CR2 is not an alternative\nreceptor which renders MT-2 cells permissive to HIV without\ninteraction with the CD4 receptor.\n(v) Enhancement is mediated via the alternative comple-\nment activation pathway. To evaluate whether enhancement\noccurred by the classical or the alternative pathway, HIV was\npreincubated with a dilution series of factor B-de\ufb01cient serum\nwhich is de\ufb01cient in the alternative complement activation\npathway. Preincubating HIV with factor B-de\ufb01cient serum\n(Sigma) gave no enhancement in the presence or absence of\nheat inactivated serum from an HIV-1-infected donor in a\ndilution of 1:1,000 (Fig. 4). Enhancement was seen after res-\ntoration of the alternative pathway by the addition of factor B\n(P , 0.05) during preincubation, and the enhancement was\nampli\ufb01ed in the presence of HIV-positive serum (P , 0.05).\nThe addition of factor B to normal, fresh human serum did not\nalter the level of infection (data not shown).\n(vi) 1nfection under C\u2019ADE conditions increases the virus\ntiter 27-fold. Preincubating HIV in a twofold dilution series\nwith HIV-positive serum in a dilution of 1:1,000 and fresh\nhuman serum in a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h before the addition\nof cells for 3 h resulted in an end point virus titer 27-fold higher\n(titer 5 1,024) than that in a control to which no serum was\nadded (titer 5 37).\n(vii) Enhancement is not due to activation of cells by factors\nin serum. 1n order to examine whether enhancement could be\ndue to serum factors activating the cells to become more sus-\nceptible to HIV infection or inclined to produce more virus, we\npreincubated the cells with heat-inactivated HIV-positive se-\nrum in a dilution of 1:1,000 and/or fresh human complement in\na dilution of 1:100 for 30 min before a washing and subsequent\nincubation with virus for 3 h. These pretreatments did not alter\nthe level of infection (P . 0.3 relative to the control to which\nno serum was added). 1n contrast, preincubation of virus with\ncomplement or serum plus complement for 3 h increased the\nlevel of infection signi\ufb01cantly (P , 0.01), and inoculation in the\npresence of antibodies alone decreased the infection (P ,\n0.05) relative to that in a control to which no serum was added\n(Fig. 5).\n(viii) 1nfection under C\u2019ADE conditions reaches maximum\nlevel within 5 min after incubation.

VIROL.\n\nof HIV infection, an assay in which HIV was allowed to bind to\nthe MT-2 cells for 5 to 1,440 min before being washed was\nperformed. Under C\u2019ADE conditions, the infection reached a\nhigh level within 5 min and increased slowly, though not sig-\nni\ufb01cantly (P . 0.05), thereafter (Fig. 6). The addition of sCD4\nafter 30 min did not lead to a signi\ufb01cantly (P . 0.05) lower\ninfection rate. Without HIV-positive serum and complement,\nthe infection rate started to rise after 30 min and reached a\nmaximum level after 1,080 min, and the infection was blocked\nwhen sCD4 was added after 30 min (P , 0.05). Calculation of\nthe diffusion-limited aggregation rate (kaM) shows that it takes\napproximately 30 min before half of the virions have encoun-\ntered a cell. The saturation of the infection process seen under\nC\u2019ADE conditions after only 5 min can therefore not be due to\na major part of the HIV particles being bound to cells. We\ntherefore wanted to determine whether the abrogation of the\nenhanced infection process could be due to complement sat-\nurating the complement receptors. Cells, virus, or both were\npreincubated with complement prior to incubation of cells with\nvirus for 3 h. Table 4 shows that preincubation of cells for 30\nmin with fresh serum from an HIV-negative donor did not\nenhance, while virus preincubated for 1 h with the serum did.\nWhen virus was preincubated with complement, the addition\nof complement to cells resulted in a reduced level of enhance-\nment, indicating that complement competed for complement\nreceptors.\nFIG. 4.

(i) The rapid saturation of the enhanced\ninfection process may be due to saturation of complement\nreceptors. Figure 7 shows a model simulation of the number of\nvirions bound to cells under enhancing conditions and under\ncontrol conditions as a function of the incubation time.\nThe reason for the faster reaction under enhancing condi-\ntions in the model simulation is that a larger fraction of the\nHIV surface is covered by complement than is covered by\ngp120. Saturation of the infection process occurs, since a major\npart of the complement receptors is occupied by HIV-associ-\nated complement.\n(ii) The model qualitatively explains the experimental re-\nsults. Figure 8 shows simulation results for the combined ef-\nfects of antibodies and complement. 1t can be seen that the\nmodel captures the main features of the experimental data\nshown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Note that the antibody titer giving\nthe maximal enhancement increases as the complement is di-\nluted, corresponding to the experimental results shown in Fig.\n1. At high complement concentrations, less antibody is needed\nto obtain high-level saturation of HIV with complement. For\nthe model to show enhancement when the concentration of\nantibodies is set to zero, we need to assume either that com-\nplement can bind to HIV in the absence of antibodies as in Fig.\n8 or alternatively that the complement serum contains heter-\nologous antibodies that can facilitate complement binding to\nHIV.\nDISCUSSION\nComplement-mediated enhancement can be explained by at\nleast three mechanisms: (i) antibody and/or complement may\nincrease the binding of virus to target cells, (ii) they may\nincrease the fusion of HIV with cells, or (iii) they may have\nnonspeci\ufb01c stimulatory effects on target cells. These mecha-\nnisms might also act to render otherwise inert virions infec-\ntious. When cells were preincubated with complement and\nthen washed, we did not \ufb01nd any alteration of the level of\ninfection, indicating that enhancement was not due to activa-\ntion of the cells. Our results, indicating that the mechanism of\nenhancement is well explained by the increased adhesion to\ntarget cell CR2s after complement deposition on HIV, are in\naccordance with those of Monte\ufb01ori et al. (21), who found that\nbinding of HIV to CR21 MT-2 and Raji-3 cells increased after\npretreatment with complement. Our \ufb01nding that the infection\nwas still sensitive to sCD4 is also in accordance with the results\nof Monte\ufb01ori et al. (21), who could not infect Raji-3 cells\nwhich are CD42 CR21. Thus, complement might act to get a\nlarger fraction of the virions into close proximity of target cell\nCD4 receptors, thus enabling them to infect. Adhesion of HIV\nto the cell surface via complement, Fc, or alternative receptors\nand speci\ufb01c binding to CD4 are therefore two separate pro-\ncesses, and infection is crucially dependent on the latter. Sim-\nulation studies showed that the observed complement and an-\ntibody dose dependences are well explained by a hypothesis\ninvolving increased adhesion of complement-coated virions to\ntarget cells. Our previous work with antibody-mediated Fc\nreceptor-dependent enhancement (19) is also in accordance\nwith this conclusion.\nFIG. 6.

VIROL.\n\nEnhancement of MT-2 cells with HIV 1IIB was shown to be\nmediated via the alternative complement activation pathway\nand increased in the presence of heat-inactivated serum from\nan HIV-infected donor. We found that infection, under\nC\u2019ADE conditions, reached a high level within minutes and did\nnot increase signi\ufb01cantly thereafter. Simulation studies showed\nthat this could be explained by a large excess of HIV-comple-\nment complexes which rapidly saturate the complement recep-\ntors, thus saturating the enhanced infection process. This is\npossible even though we used a low TCID50 relative to the\nnumber of complement receptors on the cells. Electron mi-\ncroscopy studies have shown that there are 104- to 107-fold\nmore physical than infectious virus particles (17). Further-\nmore, in binding assays, Monte\ufb01ori et al. (22) have shown that\nas much as 40% of the virus input was bound to the CR2-\npositive MT-2 cells in the presence of HIV-positive serum and\nfresh human serum. A peculiar consequence of this hypothesis\nis that even if all complement receptors are saturated, it is still\nonly a small fraction of the cells that are infected, as the\nTCID50 value under enhancing conditions was only 1,024, cor-\nresponding to an infection of approximately 0.2% of the cells.\nThe enhancement seen in the experiments in which no se-\nrum from an HIV-positive donor was added can be explained\nby antibody-independent activation of the alternative comple-\nment pathway (C\u2019AIDE). Experiments showed that fresh sera\nfrom normal human donors in many cases enhance HIV in-\nfection, while heat-inactivated sera neutralize infection (un-\npublished data). C\u2019ADE may have severe implications for vac-\ncine development, since antibody raised against all synthetic\npeptides encompassing the whole gp120 and gp41 sequence\nseem able to produce variable degrees of C\u2019ADE (13). Even\nantibodies raised against 10 of 21 strain-speci\ufb01c V3 loop pep-\ntides could enhance (13), thereby reducing the possibility of\n\ufb01nding a non-C\u2019ADE mediating epitope as a safe target for\nvaccine development.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Henriette Buch for excellent technical assistance.\nThis work was supported by the Danish 1991 Pharmacy Association,\nthe Danish 1nsurance Association, the Novo-Nordisk Foundation, the 1ngeborg Roikjers Foundation, the Hartmann Foundation, the John\nFIG. 7.

Experimental studies showed that while HIV-positive\nsera neutralize HIV infection, the addition of fresh complement abrogated neutralization and could even cause\nenhancement. Enhancement was blocked by anti-complement receptor 2 antibodies, and infection under\nenhancing conditions could be blocked by soluble CD4. Antibody-dependent complement-mediated enhance-\nment (C\u2019ADE) was dependent on the alternative complement activation pathway, as factor B-de\ufb01cient serum\ncould enhance only after the addition of factor B. The observed enhancement was also antibody dependent,\nsince the addition of antibodies increased the level of enhancement. Under C\u2019ADE conditions, infection reached\na plateau within 5 min and was not caused by activation of cells by factors in the human serum. On the\ncontrary, preincubation of cells with complement decreased the level of enhancement. A theoretical model of\nHIV infection in vitro which exhibited similar enhancement in an antibody- and complement concentration-\ndependent way was developed. Model studies indicated that the enhanced infection process could be explained\nby the fact that virions, because of complement deposition on the surface, bind more ef\ufb01ciently to cells. The\nmodel also indicated that the saturation of the enhanced infection process seen after a few minutes could be\ncaused by saturation of the complement receptors. The effect of neutralizing antibodies can thus be overcome\nby the enhancing effect of complement that facilitates the contact between gp120 and CD4. These studies\ndemonstrate that the main features of the complement-dependent enhancement phenomenon can be under-\nstood in terms of a simple mathematical model.\nComplement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement\n(C\u2019ADE) has been found in vitro both in sera from three of\nfour volunteers vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia virus ex-\npressing human immunode\ufb01ciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp160\nand boosted with baculovirus-derived recombinant gp160\n(rgp160) (20) and in 25% of healthy adults vaccinated with\nHIV-1 rgp160 (8). It is therefore possible that C\u2019ADE reduces\nor even reverses vaccine ef\ufb01cacy. HIV and HIV-infected cells\neither in conjunction with or independent of antibody can\nactivate the complement cascade by the classical or the alter-\nnative pathway (7). The complement system is chronically ac-\ntivated throughout the infection in vivo, probably resulting in\nthe reduced levels of complement found in HIV-infected pa-\ntients by several groups (7, 24). C\u2019ADE and complement-me-\ndiated antibody-independent enhancement (C\u2019AIDE) may\ncontribute to the in vivo pathogenesis of HIV infection. This\nhypothesis is supported by the \ufb01ndings that 10 to 50% of\nhuman CD41 T lymphocytes express complement receptor 2\n(CR2) and that this fraction is reduced during HIV infection,\nsuggesting that these CD41 CR21 T cells are selectively in-\nfected and killed either by direct cytopathic effects of HIV or\nby HIV-speci\ufb01c immunological mechanisms (14). Comple-\nment-coated cells have also been shown to be more sensitive to\nattack by natural killer cells (37). Although it has been re-\nported in several instances (26, 34), viral neutralization by\ncomplement-mediated lysis is still controversial (7, 33).\nIt is generally believed that C\u2019ADE requires complement\nreceptors and CD4 receptors (30, 35), since C\u2019ADE can be\nblocked by antibodies against CR2 (10, 31) and CR3 (28).\nComplement-mediated binding to target cells seems indepen-\ndent of CD4 (1, 21, 22), but infection is generally believed to\nrequire CD4 receptors (7, 10, 11, 22), although CD4-indepen-\ndent C\u2019ADE infection of MT-2 cells has been reported (3, 7).\nAt least three fundamentally different hypotheses can be\nproposed to explain the observed enhancement phenomena.\n(i) Antibodies and/or complement may increase adhesion of\nHIV to complement receptor-bearing cells. C3 fragments de-\nposited on either gp41 (29, 30) or other epitopes (13), classi-\ncally (normally antibody dependently) or alternatively (nor-\nmally antibody independently), could increase the binding of\nHIV to target cells possessing complement receptors (CR2 in\nthe case of MT-2 cells) and thereby facilitate the contact be-\ntween gp120 and cell-associated CD4, causing increased virus\nuptake (1) and provirus formation (15). (ii) Complement\nbound to virus may facilitate HIV-cell fusion. (iii) Comple-\nment deposited on HIV may have nonspeci\ufb01c stimulatory ef-\nfects on target cells, such as increasing cellular metabolism and\nvirus production. C3a and C5a, which stimulate many immune\ncells, are released during complement activation and could\nhave such effects. Alternatively, cells may also be stimulated by\nCR2 cross-linking or CR2 and CD4 cross-linking caused by\ncomplement deposition on cells (15).\nIt is not trivial to predict the effect of antibodies and com-\nplement on HIV infection, since both have been shown to have\n* Corresponding author.

We have previously\nshown that antibody-dependent enhancement of HIV infection\nof U937 cells is well explained by a mathematical model based\non a hypothesis of increased adhesion of antibody-coated viri-\nons to target cells (19). In this study we have investigated the\nmechanisms of complement and antibody-dependent enhance-\nment of HIV IIIB infection of MT-2 cells experimentally and\nexamined whether a mathematical model based on the ob-\nserved phenomena shows similar infection kinetics and anti-\nbody and complement dose dependence.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCells and virus. The human T-lymphoblastoid cell line used in the experiments\nwas MT-2, a human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-transformed CD41\nand CR21 cell line (repository reference ADP014 obtained from the Medical\nResearch Council, MRC, London, England). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640\ncontaining 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU of penicillin per ml,\n20 mg of gentamicin per ml, and 100 IU of streptomycin (growth medium) at a\ndensity of 0.2 3 106 to 1.2 3 106 cells per ml, and maintained at 378C and 5%\nCO2. The HIV-1 laboratory strain HIV IIIB (obtained from R. C. Gallo, Na-\ntional Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md.) was obtained as a supernatant from\nfreshly infected H9 cells (25). Supernatants were harvested, \ufb01ltered (pore size,\n0.45 mm), aliquotted, and stored at 2808 until use. The approximate 50% tissue\nculture infectious dose (TCID50) of HIV IIIB was calculated by end point\ntitration with MT-2 cells by the method of Reed and Muench (27). Cells (5 3\n105) were inoculated with a \ufb01vefold dilution series of virus for 3 h and then\nextensively washed and cultured in quadruplicates of 5 3 104 cells. The HIV\nantigen concentrations in the supernatants were determined by HIV antigen\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described below.\nELISA for HIV antigen. Cell-free culture supernatants were examined for HIV\nantigen with a biotin-avidin potentiated double-antibody ELISA with human\nimmunoglobulin G against HIV, as described previously (12, 23). Each plate\nincluded a dilution series of a standard HIV antigen preparation, and optical\ndensities were expressed relative to this standard in arbitrary units.\nSera and reagents. Human serum used as a complement source (i.e., fresh\nhuman serum) was collected from an HIV-negative donor, aliquotted, and stored\nat 2808C until use. For neutralization, HIV IIIB neutralizing serum (anti-HIV\nserum) was obtained from an HIV-positive patient. Serum was heat inactivated\nat 568C for 30 min, aliquotted, and stored at 2208C. Further, a serum sample was\nfreshly frozen and stored at 2808C to be used as an autologous complement\nsource. Factor B-de\ufb01cient serum, factor B, and a standard serum were purchased\nfrom Sigma (catalog numbers C0535, C4909, and C2038, respectively). Mono-\nclonal antibodies directed to CR2 (OKB7) and CD4 (OKT4) were purchased\nfrom Ortho Diagnostic Systems (Raritan, N.J.; catalog numbers 700720 and\n700420, respectively). All antibodies were dialyzed and \ufb01ltered (pore size, 0.22\nmm) before use. Recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4), produced in CHO cells, was\nobtained from Neosystem Laboratoire, Strassbourg, France (catalog number SC\n925100).\nInfection neutralization and enhancement assay. To determine whether en-\nhancement occurred, a dilution series of anti-HIV serum was mixed with a\ndilution series of complement, and then 25 TCID50 of HIV IIIB was added. After\npreincubation for 1 h at 378C, 5 3 105 MT-2 cells in growth medium were added\nand inoculated for 3 h at 378C. After an extensive washing, cells were resus-\npended in 2 ml of growth medium, and quadruplicates of 5 3 104 cells were\ntransferred to a 96-well cell culture plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), and plates\nwere incubated at 378C in 5% CO2 for 4 days. Supernatants were then harvested,\nand the HIV antigen concentration was measured.\nUnless otherwise stated, experiments were performed at least twice with iden-\ntical results. Means of quadruplicates were compared by a Student\u2019s t test (two-\nsided), allowing for unequal variances.\nModel formulation. The model is based on an in vitro system in which a\npopulation of target cells is infected by a population of HIV virions. It is an\nextension of the model proposed by Lund et al. (19) for antibody-mediated\nenhancement. Target cells and HIV are present in a supernatant in concentra-\ntions M and V, respectively. It is assumed that the concentration of target cells,\nM, is constant. The concentration of live virions is assumed to decay exponen-\ntially at a per capita rate, kn. The concentration of free live virions will also\ndiminish because of adhesion to the target cells at rate kaMV, thus giving rise to\na population of cell-bound virions, the concentration of which we shall denote as\nB. ka is the time-dependent association rate for the complex formation. The\nadhered virions will infect the cells at rate kiB, where ki is the infection rate per\nadhered virion. The concentration of cell-bound virions is also assumed to\ndecrease because of inactivation of the adhered virus at rate knB. The concen-\ntration of infected cells, which we shall denote as I, rises at a rate equal to the\ninfection by cell-bound virions. It is assumed that the multiplicity of infection is\nlow. The above assumptions lead to the following equations:\ndB\ndt 5 kaMV 2 knB 2 kiB\n(1)\ndI\ndt 5 kiB\n(2)\ndV\ndt 5 2 kaMV 2 knV\n(3)\nThe rate of reaction, ka, can be calculated as the product of the maximum rate\nconstant for diffusion-limited aggregation, kd, and the probability of reaction, Pa.\nkd 5 4p(Dc 1 Dv) (rc 1 rv), where D and r are the diffusion constants and radii\nfor cells (subscript c) and virus (subscript v), respectively (4). The diffusion\nconstant for a particle with radius r is D 5 kT/6phr, where k is the Boltzman\nconstant, T is the absolute temperature, and h is the viscosity of the liquid in\nwhich the particle diffuses (4). As shown by Berg and Purcell (2), the probability\n(Pa) that a small molecule which has arrived at the surface of a cell will \ufb01nd a\nreceptor to bind to can be estimated as Pa 5 Nrr/(Nrr 1 prc). Here, N is the\nnumber of receptors on the cell surface to which the small molecule can bind,\nand rr is the functional radius of these receptors, i.e., the radius within which the\nsmall molecule has to be in order to bind to the receptor. A similar result was\nobtained by Shoup and Szabo (32) by a different approach in which they used the\nresult obtained by Collins and Kimball (5) that the forward reaction rate for a\nligand to a partly reacting sphere (ka) can be written as ka 5 kdk/(kd 1 k). By\nchoosing the Collins-Kimball constant k as N4Ds, where N is the number of\nreceptors on the cell surface and 4Ds is the reaction rate of a point ligand to a\nsingle reactive circular site with radius s on an in\ufb01nite unreactive surface, Shoup\nand Szabo immediately recover the result obtained by Berg and Purcell. To\nextend this \ufb01nding to a virus only partly covered with ligands for receptors on the\ncell, the Collins-Kimball constant is rede\ufb01ned as\nk 5 4DO\ni\nfiNisi\n(4)\nwhere fi is the fraction of the virus covered with ligand for the receptor of type\ni of which there are Ni on the cell surface.

In this equation it is assumed that the binding of\nantibody to gp120 does not block the binding of gp120 to CD4.

The association rate is assumed to be a linear combination of an\nantibody-independent term (k1) and an antibody-dependent one (k2ca). Further-\nmore, we assume that HIV infects the cells that it has adhered to at a per capita\nrate (ki) proportional to the number of non-antibody-complexed gp120 mole-\ncules on the viral surface:\nki 5 ki0~1 2 ca!g\n(13)\nHere ki0 is the infection rate for a virion with no gp120 complexed with anti-\nbodies, and it is assumed that a fraction (g 5 1026) is infectious.

Simulations of\nthe model were performed on a 66 MHz, 486 PC with a \ufb01ve-stage Runge-Kutta\nformula pair, RKN(3,4) (9), implemented in Borland Pascal (c) to solve the set\nof coupled nonlinear equations.\nRESULTS\nIn vitro experiments. (i) Enhancement or inhibition de-\npends on concentrations of antibodies and complement. The\ninfection enhancement and inhibition assays were performed\nwith MT-2 cells. HIV IIIB was preincubated with various con-\ncentrations of antibodies from heat-inactivated serum from an\nHIV-1-infected patient and complement from fresh serum\nfrom an uninfected donor. Table 2 and Fig. 1 show the effects\nof combinations of antibodies and complement on the infec-\ntion. When no complement was added, a dose-dependent neu-\ntralization as a function of the antibody concentration was seen\n(P , 0.01 when the dilution of antibody was less than 1:1,000).\nWhen no antibody was added, a dose-dependent enhancement\nas a function of the complement concentration was seen (P ,\n0.01 for a dilution of 1:10). For combinations of antibody and\ncomplement, the highest enhancement was seen for antibodies\nin a dilution of 1:1,000 and complement in a dilution of 1:10.\n(ii) Diluted complement from an HIV-1-infected patient can\nenhance infection. To evaluate whether fresh serum from an\nHIV-1-infected patient can enhance infection, combinations of\nfresh serum and heat-inactivated serum from the same HIV-\n1-infected patient were tested for enhancing and neutralizing\neffects. Table 3 and Fig. 2 show that when the dilution of serum\n(fresh plus heat inactivated) was lower than or equal to 1:10 or\nwhen only heat-inactivated serum was added, neutralization\nwas seen; otherwise, enhancement was seen.\n(iii) Enhancement can be blocked by heat inactivation of\nserum or by anti-CR2 antibodies. Enhancement is abrogated\nand antibody-mediated neutralization is regained during infec-\ntion with heat-inactivated sera, as seen in Fig. 2. To evaluate\nthe involvement of CR2, MT-2 cells were preincubated with\nthe monoclonal anti-CR2 antibody OKB7 for 1 h, and then\nFIG. 1. Three-dimensional plot of the relative level of infection.

The enhancement found\nwhen HIV was preincubated with complement in a dilution of\n1:100 and HIV-positive serum in a dilution of 1:1,000 relative\nto a control to which no serum was added was decreased\n2.7-fold by preincubating the cells with anti-CR2 antibodies\n(OKB7), but not with an indifferent antibody (OKT4), indicat-\ning that enhancement of MT-2 cells by HIV-1 IIIB is comple-\nment mediated and requires CR2.\n(iv) Infection under enhancing conditions can be blocked\nwith sCD4. To delineate whether gp120 binding to CD4 is\nnecessary for infection, we tested the effect on infection of\npreincubating HIV for 1 h with various dilutions of sCD4\ntogether with complement in a dilution of 1:100 and/or anti-\nbodies in a dilution of 1:1,000, before the addition of cells for\n3 h. Both with enhancing concentrations of antibodies and/or\ncomplement and with the control, a dose-dependent neutral-\nizing effect was seen (Fig. 3). Thus, CR2 is not an alternative\nreceptor which renders MT-2 cells permissive to HIV without\ninteraction with the CD4 receptor.\n(v) Enhancement is mediated via the alternative comple-\nment activation pathway. To evaluate whether enhancement\noccurred by the classical or the alternative pathway, HIV was\npreincubated with a dilution series of factor B-de\ufb01cient serum\nwhich is de\ufb01cient in the alternative complement activation\npathway. Preincubating HIV with factor B-de\ufb01cient serum\n(Sigma) gave no enhancement in the presence or absence of\nheat inactivated serum from an HIV-1-infected donor in a\ndilution of 1:1,000 (Fig. 4). Enhancement was seen after res-\ntoration of the alternative pathway by the addition of factor B\n(P , 0.05) during preincubation, and the enhancement was\nampli\ufb01ed in the presence of HIV-positive serum (P , 0.05).\nThe addition of factor B to normal, fresh human serum did not\nalter the level of infection (data not shown).\n(vi) Infection under C\u2019ADE conditions increases the virus\ntiter 27-fold. Preincubating HIV in a twofold dilution series\nwith HIV-positive serum in a dilution of 1:1,000 and fresh\nhuman serum in a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h before the addition\nof cells for 3 h resulted in an end point virus titer 27-fold higher\n(titer 5 1,024) than that in a control to which no serum was\nadded (titer 5 37).\n(vii) Enhancement is not due to activation of cells by factors\nin serum. In order to examine whether enhancement could be\ndue to serum factors activating the cells to become more sus-\nceptible to HIV infection or inclined to produce more virus, we\npreincubated the cells with heat-inactivated HIV-positive se-\nrum in a dilution of 1:1,000 and/or fresh human complement in\na dilution of 1:100 for 30 min before a washing and subsequent\nincubation with virus for 3 h. These pretreatments did not alter\nthe level of infection (P . 0.3 relative to the control to which\nno serum was added). In contrast, preincubation of virus with\ncomplement or serum plus complement for 3 h increased the\nlevel of infection signi\ufb01cantly (P , 0.01), and inoculation in the\npresence of antibodies alone decreased the infection (P ,\n0.05) relative to that in a control to which no serum was added\n(Fig. 5).\n(viii) Infection under C\u2019ADE conditions reaches maximum\nlevel within 5 min after incubation. To determine the kinetics\nFIG. 2. Three-dimensional plot of the level of infection as a function of\ndilution series of antibodies (S) and complement (C), from the data listed in\nTable 3.

VIROL.\n\nof HIV infection, an assay in which HIV was allowed to bind to\nthe MT-2 cells for 5 to 1,440 min before being washed was\nperformed. Under C\u2019ADE conditions, the infection reached a\nhigh level within 5 min and increased slowly, though not sig-\nni\ufb01cantly (P . 0.05), thereafter (Fig. 6). The addition of sCD4\nafter 30 min did not lead to a signi\ufb01cantly (P . 0.05) lower\ninfection rate. Without HIV-positive serum and complement,\nthe infection rate started to rise after 30 min and reached a\nmaximum level after 1,080 min, and the infection was blocked\nwhen sCD4 was added after 30 min (P , 0.05). Calculation of\nthe diffusion-limited aggregation rate (kaM) shows that it takes\napproximately 30 min before half of the virions have encoun-\ntered a cell. The saturation of the infection process seen under\nC\u2019ADE conditions after only 5 min can therefore not be due to\na major part of the HIV particles being bound to cells. We\ntherefore wanted to determine whether the abrogation of the\nenhanced infection process could be due to complement sat-\nurating the complement receptors. Cells, virus, or both were\npreincubated with complement prior to incubation of cells with\nvirus for 3 h. Table 4 shows that preincubation of cells for 30\nmin with fresh serum from an HIV-negative donor did not\nenhance, while virus preincubated for 1 h with the serum did.\nWhen virus was preincubated with complement, the addition\nof complement to cells resulted in a reduced level of enhance-\nment, indicating that complement competed for complement\nreceptors.\nFIG. 4. Effects of factor B-de\ufb01cient serum on infection. HIV was preincubated with various combinations of HIV-positive serum (S), fresh human serum from Sigma\n(C), factor B-de\ufb01cient serum from Sigma (C b-def) and factor B (B).

(i) The rapid saturation of the enhanced\ninfection process may be due to saturation of complement\nreceptors. Figure 7 shows a model simulation of the number of\nvirions bound to cells under enhancing conditions and under\ncontrol conditions as a function of the incubation time.\nThe reason for the faster reaction under enhancing condi-\ntions in the model simulation is that a larger fraction of the\nHIV surface is covered by complement than is covered by\ngp120. Saturation of the infection process occurs, since a major\npart of the complement receptors is occupied by HIV-associ-\nated complement.\n(ii) The model qualitatively explains the experimental re-\nsults. Figure 8 shows simulation results for the combined ef-\nfects of antibodies and complement. It can be seen that the\nmodel captures the main features of the experimental data\nshown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Note that the antibody titer giving\nthe maximal enhancement increases as the complement is di-\nluted, corresponding to the experimental results shown in Fig.\n1. At high complement concentrations, less antibody is needed\nto obtain high-level saturation of HIV with complement. For\nthe model to show enhancement when the concentration of\nantibodies is set to zero, we need to assume either that com-\nplement can bind to HIV in the absence of antibodies as in Fig.\n8 or alternatively that the complement serum contains heter-\nologous antibodies that can facilitate complement binding to\nHIV.\nDISCUSSION\nComplement-mediated enhancement can be explained by at\nleast three mechanisms: (i) antibody and/or complement may\nincrease the binding of virus to target cells, (ii) they may\nincrease the fusion of HIV with cells, or (iii) they may have\nnonspeci\ufb01c stimulatory effects on target cells. These mecha-\nnisms might also act to render otherwise inert virions infec-\ntious. When cells were preincubated with complement and\nthen washed, we did not \ufb01nd any alteration of the level of\ninfection, indicating that enhancement was not due to activa-\ntion of the cells. Our results, indicating that the mechanism of\nenhancement is well explained by the increased adhesion to\ntarget cell CR2s after complement deposition on HIV, are in\naccordance with those of Monte\ufb01ori et al. (21), who found that\nbinding of HIV to CR21 MT-2 and Raji-3 cells increased after\npretreatment with complement. Our \ufb01nding that the infection\nwas still sensitive to sCD4 is also in accordance with the results\nof Monte\ufb01ori et al. (21), who could not infect Raji-3 cells\nwhich are CD42 CR21. Thus, complement might act to get a\nlarger fraction of the virions into close proximity of target cell\nCD4 receptors, thus enabling them to infect. Adhesion of HIV\nto the cell surface via complement, Fc, or alternative receptors\nand speci\ufb01c binding to CD4 are therefore two separate pro-\ncesses, and infection is crucially dependent on the latter. Sim-\nulation studies showed that the observed complement and an-\ntibody dose dependences are well explained by a hypothesis\ninvolving increased adhesion of complement-coated virions to\ntarget cells. Our previous work with antibody-mediated Fc\nreceptor-dependent enhancement (19) is also in accordance\nwith this conclusion.\nFIG. 6. Kinetics of HIV infection when HIV is incubated with cells for 5 to 1,440 min before being washed. Shown are the results for HIV preincubated for 1 h\nwith serum from an HIV-negative donor in a dilution of 1:100 and serum from an HIV-infected patient in a dilution of 1:1,000 before the addition of cells ({) and\nfor a mock-treated control (\u2014\u2014).

VIROL.\n\nEnhancement of MT-2 cells with HIV IIIB was shown to be\nmediated via the alternative complement activation pathway\nand increased in the presence of heat-inactivated serum from\nan HIV-infected donor. We found that infection, under\nC\u2019ADE conditions, reached a high level within minutes and did\nnot increase signi\ufb01cantly thereafter. Simulation studies showed\nthat this could be explained by a large excess of HIV-comple-\nment complexes which rapidly saturate the complement recep-\ntors, thus saturating the enhanced infection process. This is\npossible even though we used a low TCID50 relative to the\nnumber of complement receptors on the cells. Electron mi-\ncroscopy studies have shown that there are 104- to 107-fold\nmore physical than infectious virus particles (17). Further-\nmore, in binding assays, Monte\ufb01ori et al. (22) have shown that\nas much as 40% of the virus input was bound to the CR2-\npositive MT-2 cells in the presence of HIV-positive serum and\nfresh human serum. A peculiar consequence of this hypothesis\nis that even if all complement receptors are saturated, it is still\nonly a small fraction of the cells that are infected, as the\nTCID50 value under enhancing conditions was only 1,024, cor-\nresponding to an infection of approximately 0.2% of the cells.\nThe enhancement seen in the experiments in which no se-\nrum from an HIV-positive donor was added can be explained\nby antibody-independent activation of the alternative comple-\nment pathway (C\u2019AIDE). Experiments showed that fresh sera\nfrom normal human donors in many cases enhance HIV in-\nfection, while heat-inactivated sera neutralize infection (un-\npublished data). C\u2019ADE may have severe implications for vac-\ncine development, since antibody raised against all synthetic\npeptides encompassing the whole gp120 and gp41 sequence\nseem able to produce variable degrees of C\u2019ADE (13). Even\nantibodies raised against 10 of 21 strain-speci\ufb01c V3 loop pep-\ntides could enhance (13), thereby reducing the possibility of\n\ufb01nding a non-C\u2019ADE mediating epitope as a safe target for\nvaccine development.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Henriette Buch for excellent technical assistance.\nThis work was supported by the Danish 1991 Pharmacy Association,\nthe Danish Insurance Association, the Novo-Nordisk Foundation, the\nIngeborg Roikjers Foundation, the Hartmam Foundation, the John\nFIG. 7.

Experimental studies showed that while HIV-positive\nsera neutralize HIV infection, the addition of fresh complement abrogated neutralization and could even cause\nenhancement. Enhancement was blocked by anti-complement receptor 2 antibodies, and infection under\nenhancing conditions could be blocked by soluble CD4. Antibody-dependent complement-mediated enhance-\nment (C\u2019ADE) was dependent on the alternative complement activation pathway, as factor B-de\ufb01cient serum\ncould enhance only after the addition of factor B. The observed enhancement was also antibody dependent,\nsince the addition of antibodies increased the level of enhancement. Under C\u2019ADE conditions, infection reached\na plateau within 5 min and was not caused by activation of cells by factors in the human serum. On the\ncontrary, preincubation of cells with complement decreased the level of enhancement. A theoretical model of\nHIV infection in vitro which exhibited similar enhancement in an antibody- and complement concentration-\ndependent way was developed. Model studies indicated that the enhanced infection process could be explained\nby the fact that virions, because of complement deposition on the surface, bind more ef\ufb01ciently to cells. The\nmodel also indicated that the saturation of the enhanced infection process seen after a few minutes could be\ncaused by saturation of the complement receptors. The effect of neutralizing antibodies can thus be overcome\nby the enhancing effect of complement that facilitates the contact between gp120 and CD4. These studies\ndemonstrate that the main features of the complement-dependent enhancement phenomenon can be under-\nstood in terms of a simple mathematical model.\nComplement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement\n(C\u2019ADE) has been found in vitro both in sera from three of\nfour volunteers vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia virus ex-\npressing human immunode\ufb01ciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp160\nand boosted with baculovirus-derived recombinant gp160\n(rgp160) (20) and in 25% of healthy adults vaccinated with\nHIV-1 rgp160 (8). It is therefore possible that C\u2019ADE reduces\nor even reverses vaccine ef\ufb01cacy. HIV and HIV-infected cells\neither in conjunction with or independent of antibody can\nactivate the complement cascade by the classical or the alter-\nnative pathway (7). The complement system is chronically ac-\ntivated throughout the infection in vivo, probably resulting in\nthe reduced levels of complement found in HIV-infected pa-\ntients by several groups (7, 24). C\u2019ADE and complement-me-\ndiated antibody-independent enhancement (C\u2019AIDE) may\ncontribute to the in vivo pathogenesis of HIV infection. This\nhypothesis is supported by the \ufb01ndings that 10 to 50% of\nhuman CD41 T lymphocytes express complement receptor 2\n(CR2) and that this fraction is reduced during HIV infection,\nsuggesting that these CD41 CR21 T cells are selectively in-\nfected and killed either by direct cytopathic effects of HIV or\nby HIV-speci\ufb01c immunological mechanisms (14). Comple-\nment-coated cells have also been shown to be more sensitive to\nattack by natural killer cells (37). Although it has been re-\nported in several instances (26, 34), viral neutralization by\ncomplement-mediated lysis is still controversial (7, 33).\nIt is generally believed that C\u2019ADE requires complement\nreceptors and CD4 receptors (30, 35), since C\u2019ADE can be\nblocked by antibodies against CR2 (10, 31) and CR3 (28).\nComplement-mediated binding to target cells seems indepen-\ndent of CD4 (1, 21, 22), but infection is generally believed to\nrequire CD4 receptors (7, 10, 11, 22), although CD4-indepen-\ndent C\u2019ADE infection of MT-2 cells has been reported (3, 7).\nAt least three fundamentally different hypotheses can be\nproposed to explain the observed enhancement phenomena.\n(i) Antibodies and/or complement may increase adhesion of\nHIV to complement receptor-bearing cells. C3 fragments de-\nposited on either gp41 (29, 30) or other epitopes (13), classi-\ncally (normally antibody dependently) or alternatively (nor-\nmally antibody independently), could increase the binding of\nHIV to target cells possessing complement receptors (CR2 in\nthe case of MT-2 cells) and thereby facilitate the contact be-\ntween gp120 and cell-associated CD4, causing increased virus\nuptake (1) and provirus formation (15). (ii) Complement\nbound to virus may facilitate HIV-cell fusion. (iii) Comple-\nment deposited on HIV may have nonspeci\ufb01c stimulatory ef-\nfects on target cells, such as increasing cellular metabolism and\nvirus production. C3a and C5a, which stimulate many immune\ncells, are released during complement activation and could\nhave such effects. Alternatively, cells may also be stimulated by\nCR2 cross-linking or CR2 and CD4 cross-linking caused by\ncomplement deposition on cells (15).\nIt is not trivial to predict the effect of antibodies and com-\nplement on HIV infection, since both have been shown to have\n* Corresponding author.

We have previously\nshown that antibody-dependent enhancement of HIV infection\nof U937 cells is well explained by a mathematical model based\non a hypothesis of increased adhesion of antibody-coated viri-\nons to target cells (19). In this study we have investigated the\nmechanisms of complement and antibody-dependent enhance-\nment of HIV IIIB infection of MT-2 cells experimentally and\nexamined whether a mathematical model based on the ob-\nserved phenomena shows similar infection kinetics and anti-\nbody and complement dose dependence.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCells and virus. The human T-lymphoblastoid cell line used in the experiments\nwas MT-2, a human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-transformed CD41\nand CR21 cell line (repository reference ADP014 obtained from the Medical\nResearch Council, MRC, London, England). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640\ncontaining 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU of penicillin per ml,\n20 mg of gentamicin per ml, and 100 IU of streptomycin (growth medium) at a\ndensity of 0.2 3 106 to 1.2 3 106 cells per ml, and maintained at 378C and 5%\nCO2. The HIV-1 laboratory strain HIV IIIB (obtained from R. C. Gallo, Na-\ntional Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md.) was obtained as a supernatant from\nfreshly infected H9 cells (25). Supernatants were harvested, \ufb01ltered (pore size,\n0.45 mm), aliquotted, and stored at 2808 until use. The approximate 50% tissue\nculture infectious dose (TCID50) of HIV IIIB was calculated by end point\ntitration with MT-2 cells by the method of Reed and Muench (27). Cells (5 3\n105) were inoculated with a \ufb01vefold dilution series of virus for 3 h and then\nextensively washed and cultured in quadruplicates of 5 3 104 cells. The HIV\nantigen concentrations in the supernatants were determined by HIV antigen\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described below.\nELISA for HIV antigen. Cell-free culture supernatants were examined for HIV\nantigen with a biotin-avidin potentiated double-antibody ELISA with human\nimmunoglobulin G against HIV, as described previously (12, 23). Each plate\nincluded a dilution series of a standard HIV antigen preparation, and optical\ndensities were expressed relative to this standard in arbitrary units.\nSera and reagents. Human serum used as a complement source (i.e., fresh\nhuman serum) was collected from an HIV-negative donor, aliquotted, and stored\nat 2808C until use. For neutralization, HIV IIIB neutralizing serum (anti-HIV\nserum) was obtained from an HIV-positive patient. Serum was heat inactivated\nat 568C for 30 min, aliquotted, and stored at 2208C. Further, a serum sample was\nfreshly frozen and stored at 2808C to be used as an autologous complement\nsource. Factor B-de\ufb01cient serum, factor B, and a standard serum were purchased\nfrom Sigma (catalog numbers C0535, C4909, and C2038, respectively). Mono-\nclonal antibodies directed to CR2 (OKB7) and CD4 (OKT4) were purchased\nfrom Ortho Diagnostic Systems (Raritan, N.J.; catalog numbers 700720 and\n700420, respectively). All antibodies were dialyzed and \ufb01ltered (pore size, 0.22\nmm) before use. Recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4), produced in CHO cells, was\nobtained from Neosystem Laboratoire, Strassbourg, France (catalog number SC\n925100).\nInfection neutralization and enhancement assay. To determine whether en-\nhancement occurred, a dilution series of anti-HIV serum was mixed with a\ndilution series of complement, and then 25 TCID50 of HIV IIIB was added. After\npreincubation for 1 h at 378C, 5 3 105 MT-2 cells in growth medium were added\nand inoculated for 3 h at 378C. After an extensive washing, cells were resus-\npended in 2 ml of growth medium, and quadruplicates of 5 3 104 cells were\ntransferred to a 96-well cell culture plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), and plates\nwere incubated at 378C in 5% CO2 for 4 days. Supernatants were then harvested,\nand the HIV antigen concentration was measured.\nUnless otherwise stated, experiments were performed at least twice with iden-\ntical results. Means of quadruplicates were compared by a Student\u2019s t test (two-\nsided), allowing for unequal variances.\nModel formulation. The model is based on an in vitro system in which a\npopulation of target cells is infected by a population of HIV virions. It is an\nextension of the model proposed by Lund et al. (19) for antibody-mediated\nenhancement. Target cells and HIV are present in a supernatant in concentra-\ntions M and V, respectively. It is assumed that the concentration of target cells,\nM, is constant. The concentration of live virions is assumed to decay exponen-\ntially at a per capita rate, kn. The concentration of free live virions will also\ndiminish because of adhesion to the target cells at rate kaMV, thus giving rise to\na population of cell-bound virions, the concentration of which we shall denote as\nB. ka is the time-dependent association rate for the complex formation. The\nadhered virions will infect the cells at rate kiB, where ki is the infection rate per\nadhered virion. The concentration of cell-bound virions is also assumed to\ndecrease because of inactivation of the adhered virus at rate knB. The concen-\ntration of infected cells, which we shall denote as I, rises at a rate equal to the\ninfection by cell-bound virions. It is assumed that the multiplicity of infection is\nlow. The above assumptions lead to the following equations:\ndB\ndt 5 kaMV 2 knB 2 kiB\n(1)\ndI\ndt 5 kiB\n(2)\ndV\ndt 5 2 kaMV 2 knV\n(3)\nThe rate of reaction, ka, can be calculated as the product of the maximum rate\nconstant for diffusion-limited aggregation, kd, and the probability of reaction, Pa.\nkd 5 4p(Dc 1 Dv) (rc 1 rv), where D and r are the diffusion constants and radii\nfor cells (subscript c) and virus (subscript v), respectively (4). The diffusion\nconstant for a particle with radius r is D 5 kT/6phr, where k is the Boltzman\nconstant, T is the absolute temperature, and h is the viscosity of the liquid in\nwhich the particle diffuses (4). As shown by Berg and Purcell (2), the probability\n(Pa) that a small molecule which has arrived at the surface of a cell will \ufb01nd a\nreceptor to bind to can be estimated as Pa 5 Nrr/(Nrr 1 prc). Here, N is the\nnumber of receptors on the cell surface to which the small molecule can bind,\nand rr is the functional radius of these receptors, i.e., the radius within which the\nsmall molecule has to be in order to bind to the receptor. A similar result was\nobtained by Shoup and Szabo (32) by a different approach in which they used the\nresult obtained by Collins and Kimball (5) that the forward reaction rate for a\nligand to a partly reacting sphere (ka) can be written as ka 5 kdk/(kd 1 k). By\nchoosing the Collins-Kimball constant k as N4Ds, where N is the number of\nreceptors on the cell surface and 4Ds is the reaction rate of a point ligand to a\nsingle reactive circular site with radius s on an in\ufb01nite unreactive surface, Shoup\nand Szabo immediately recover the result obtained by Berg and Purcell. To\nextend this \ufb01nding to a virus only partly covered with ligands for receptors on the\ncell, the Collins-Kimball constant is rede\ufb01ned as\nk 5 4DO\ni\nfiNisi\n(4)\nwhere fi is the fraction of the virus covered with ligand for the receptor of type\ni of which there are Ni on the cell surface. We thus obtain\nPa 5 O\ni~fiNisi!\nO\ni~fiNisi! 1 prc\n(5)\nIn the case of HIV, the fraction of the surface that can bind to CD4 is\nfc 5\nNgrg\n2\n4rv\n2\n(6)\nwhere Ng and rg are the number and radius of gp120 molecules on the surface of\nan HIV virion, respectively. In this equation it is assumed that the binding of\nantibody to gp120 does not block the binding of gp120 to CD4. Correspondingly,\nthe fraction of the viral surface that can bind to complement receptors on the cell\nsurface is\nfk 5\nNkrk\n2ck\n4rv\n2\n(7)\nwhere Nk is the number of sites on the virus where complement can bind and rk\nis the radius of the complement receptor-binding site on deposited complement.\nck is the fraction of complement-binding sites occupied. The probability of\nadhesion (Pa) for this two-receptor system is\nPa 5\nfcNCDrCD 1 fkNCRrCR\nfcNCDrCD 1 fkNCRrCR 1 prc\n(8)\nHere rCD and rCR are the radii of the CD4 and the complement receptors,\nrespectively. Using a quasi-steady-state assumption, the numbers of free CD4\nreceptors (NCD) and complement receptors (NCR) are calculated as\nNCD 5 max~0,NCDt 2 bBNg/M!\n(9)\nNCR 5 max~0,NCRt 2 bBNkck/M!\n(10)\nwhere NCDt and NCRt are the average number of CD4 and CR2 receptors on the\ncells, respectively, and Nkck is the average number of complement molecules on\neach virion. In the above equation it is assumed that HIV binds to a cell with the\nligands on a contact surface which is assumed to cover a fraction (b) of the virion\nsurface.\nUnder the assumption of antibody excess, the fraction of gp120 molecules\ncomplexed with antibodies (ca) can be calculated as (6, 19).\nca 5\na\n1/km 1 a\n(11)\nwhere a is the concentration of antibodies and km is the equilibrium constant for\n2394\nLUND ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nthe reaction. Similarly, the fraction of complement-binding sites occupied (ck) is\nwritten\nck 5\nK\nk2/~k1 1 k2ca! 1 K\n(12)\nwhere K is the concentration of complement relative to the concentration of\ncomplement in normal human serum, and k2 is the dissociation rate for com-\nplement. The association rate is assumed to be a linear combination of an\nantibody-independent term (k1) and an antibody-dependent one (k2ca). Further-\nmore, we assume that HIV infects the cells that it has adhered to at a per capita\nrate (ki) proportional to the number of non-antibody-complexed gp120 mole-\ncules on the viral surface:\nki 5 ki0~1 2 ca!g\n(13)\nHere ki0 is the infection rate for a virion with no gp120 complexed with anti-\nbodies, and it is assumed that a fraction (g 5 1026) is infectious. This value of\ng lies in the range found by Layne et al. (17).\nThe parameters used in the simulations are listed in Table 1. Simulations of\nthe model were performed on a 66 MHz, 486 PC with a \ufb01ve-stage Runge-Kutta\nformula pair, RKN(3,4) (9), implemented in Borland Pascal (c) to solve the set\nof coupled nonlinear equations.\nRESULTS\nIn vitro experiments. (i) Enhancement or inhibition de-\npends on concentrations of antibodies and complement. The\ninfection enhancement and inhibition assays were performed\nwith MT-2 cells. HIV IIIB was preincubated with various con-\ncentrations of antibodies from heat-inactivated serum from an\nHIV-1-infected patient and complement from fresh serum\nfrom an uninfected donor. Table 2 and Fig. 1 show the effects\nof combinations of antibodies and complement on the infec-\ntion. When no complement was added, a dose-dependent neu-\ntralization as a function of the antibody concentration was seen\n(P , 0.01 when the dilution of antibody was less than 1:1,000).\nWhen no antibody was added, a dose-dependent enhancement\nas a function of the complement concentration was seen (P ,\n0.01 for a dilution of 1:10). For combinations of antibody and\ncomplement, the highest enhancement was seen for antibodies\nin a dilution of 1:1,000 and complement in a dilution of 1:10.\n(ii) Diluted complement from an HIV-1-infected patient can\nenhance infection. To evaluate whether fresh serum from an\nHIV-1-infected patient can enhance infection, combinations of\nfresh serum and heat-inactivated serum from the same HIV-\n1-infected patient were tested for enhancing and neutralizing\neffects. Table 3 and Fig. 2 show that when the dilution of serum\n(fresh plus heat inactivated) was lower than or equal to 1:10 or\nwhen only heat-inactivated serum was added, neutralization\nwas seen; otherwise, enhancement was seen.\n(iii) Enhancement can be blocked by heat inactivation of\nserum or by anti-CR2 antibodies. Enhancement is abrogated\nand antibody-mediated neutralization is regained during infec-\ntion with heat-inactivated sera, as seen in Fig. 2.

The enhancement found\nwhen HIV was preincubated with complement in a dilution of\n1:100 and HIV-positive serum in a dilution of 1:1,000 relative\nto a control to which no serum was added was decreased\n2.7-fold by preincubating the cells with anti-CR2 antibodies\n(OKB7), but not with an indifferent antibody (OKT4), indicat-\ning that enhancement of MT-2 cells by HIV-1 IIIB is comple-\nment mediated and requires CR2.\n(iv) Infection under enhancing conditions can be blocked\nwith sCD4. To delineate whether gp120 binding to CD4 is\nnecessary for infection, we tested the effect on infection of\npreincubating HIV for 1 h with various dilutions of sCD4\ntogether with complement in a dilution of 1:100 and/or anti-\nbodies in a dilution of 1:1,000, before the addition of cells for\n3 h. Both with enhancing concentrations of antibodies and/or\ncomplement and with the control, a dose-dependent neutral-\nizing effect was seen (Fig. 3). Thus, CR2 is not an alternative\nreceptor which renders MT-2 cells permissive to HIV without\ninteraction with the CD4 receptor.\n(v) Enhancement is mediated via the alternative comple-\nment activation pathway. To evaluate whether enhancement\noccurred by the classical or the alternative pathway, HIV was\npreincubated with a dilution series of factor B-de\ufb01cient serum\nwhich is de\ufb01cient in the alternative complement activation\npathway. Preincubating HIV with factor B-de\ufb01cient serum\n(Sigma) gave no enhancement in the presence or absence of\nheat inactivated serum from an HIV-1-infected donor in a\ndilution of 1:1,000 (Fig. 4). Enhancement was seen after res-\ntoration of the alternative pathway by the addition of factor B\n(P , 0.05) during preincubation, and the enhancement was\nampli\ufb01ed in the presence of HIV-positive serum (P , 0.05).\nThe addition of factor B to normal, fresh human serum did not\nalter the level of infection (data not shown).\n(vi) Infection under C\u2019ADE conditions increases the virus\ntiter 27-fold. Preincubating HIV in a twofold dilution series\nwith HIV-positive serum in a dilution of 1:1,000 and fresh\nhuman serum in a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h before the addition\nof cells for 3 h resulted in an end point virus titer 27-fold higher\n(titer 5 1,024) than that in a control to which no serum was\nadded (titer 5 37).\n(vii) Enhancement is not due to activation of cells by factors\nin serum. In order to examine whether enhancement could be\ndue to serum factors activating the cells to become more sus-\nceptible to HIV infection or inclined to produce more virus, we\npreincubated the cells with heat-inactivated HIV-positive se-\nrum in a dilution of 1:1,000 and/or fresh human complement in\na dilution of 1:100 for 30 min before a washing and subsequent\nincubation with virus for 3 h. These pretreatments did not alter\nthe level of infection (P . 0.3 relative to the control to which\nno serum was added). In contrast, preincubation of virus with\ncomplement or serum plus complement for 3 h increased the\nlevel of infection signi\ufb01cantly (P , 0.01), and inoculation in the\npresence of antibodies alone decreased the infection (P ,\n0.05) relative to that in a control to which no serum was added\n(Fig. 5).\n(viii) Infection under C\u2019ADE conditions reaches maximum\nlevel within 5 min after incubation. To determine the kinetics\nFIG. 2. Three-dimensional plot of the level of infection as a function of\ndilution series of antibodies (S) and complement (C), from the data listed in\nTable 3.

VIROL.\n\nof HIV infection, an assay in which HIV was allowed to bind to\nthe MT-2 cells for 5 to 1,440 min before being washed was\nperformed. Under C\u2019ADE conditions, the infection reached a\nhigh level within 5 min and increased slowly, though not sig-\nni\ufb01cantly (P . 0.05), thereafter (Fig. 6). The addition of sCD4\nafter 30 min did not lead to a signi\ufb01cantly (P . 0.05) lower\ninfection rate. Without HIV-positive serum and complement,\nthe infection rate started to rise after 30 min and reached a\nmaximum level after 1,080 min, and the infection was blocked\nwhen sCD4 was added after 30 min (P , 0.05). Calculation of\nthe diffusion-limited aggregation rate (kaM) shows that it takes\napproximately 30 min before half of the virions have encoun-\ntered a cell. The saturation of the infection process seen under\nC\u2019ADE conditions after only 5 min can therefore not be due to\na major part of the HIV particles being bound to cells. We\ntherefore wanted to determine whether the abrogation of the\nenhanced infection process could be due to complement sat-\nurating the complement receptors. Cells, virus, or both were\npreincubated with complement prior to incubation of cells with\nvirus for 3 h. Table 4 shows that preincubation of cells for 30\nmin with fresh serum from an HIV-negative donor did not\nenhance, while virus preincubated for 1 h with the serum did.\nWhen virus was preincubated with complement, the addition\nof complement to cells resulted in a reduced level of enhance-\nment, indicating that complement competed for complement\nreceptors.\nFIG. 4. Effects of factor B-de\ufb01cient serum on infection. HIV was preincubated with various combinations of HIV-positive serum (S), fresh human serum from Sigma\n(C), factor B-de\ufb01cient serum from Sigma (C b-def) and factor B (B).

(i) The rapid saturation of the enhanced\ninfection process may be due to saturation of complement\nreceptors. Figure 7 shows a model simulation of the number of\nvirions bound to cells under enhancing conditions and under\ncontrol conditions as a function of the incubation time.\nThe reason for the faster reaction under enhancing condi-\ntions in the model simulation is that a larger fraction of the\nHIV surface is covered by complement than is covered by\ngp120. Saturation of the infection process occurs, since a major\npart of the complement receptors is occupied by HIV-associ-\nated complement.\n(ii) The model qualitatively explains the experimental re-\nsults. Figure 8 shows simulation results for the combined ef-\nfects of antibodies and complement. It can be seen that the\nmodel captures the main features of the experimental data\nshown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Note that the antibody titer giving\nthe maximal enhancement increases as the complement is di-\nluted, corresponding to the experimental results shown in Fig.\n1. At high complement concentrations, less antibody is needed\nto obtain high-level saturation of HIV with complement. For\nthe model to show enhancement when the concentration of\nantibodies is set to zero, we need to assume either that com-\nplement can bind to HIV in the absence of antibodies as in Fig.\n8 or alternatively that the complement serum contains heter-\nologous antibodies that can facilitate complement binding to\nHIV.\nDISCUSSION\nComplement-mediated enhancement can be explained by at\nleast three mechanisms: (i) antibody and/or complement may\nincrease the binding of virus to target cells, (ii) they may\nincrease the fusion of HIV with cells, or (iii) they may have\nnonspeci\ufb01c stimulatory effects on target cells. These mecha-\nnisms might also act to render otherwise inert virions infec-\ntious. When cells were preincubated with complement and\nthen washed, we did not \ufb01nd any alteration of the level of\ninfection, indicating that enhancement was not due to activa-\ntion of the cells. Our results, indicating that the mechanism of\nenhancement is well explained by the increased adhesion to\ntarget cell CR2s after complement deposition on HIV, are in\naccordance with those of Monte\ufb01ori et al. (21), who found that\nbinding of HIV to CR21 MT-2 and Raji-3 cells increased after\npretreatment with complement. Our \ufb01nding that the infection\nwas still sensitive to sCD4 is also in accordance with the results\nof Monte\ufb01ori et al. (21), who could not infect Raji-3 cells\nwhich are CD42 CR21. Thus, complement might act to get a\nlarger fraction of the virions into close proximity of target cell\nCD4 receptors, thus enabling them to infect. Adhesion of HIV\nto the cell surface via complement, Fc, or alternative receptors\nand speci\ufb01c binding to CD4 are therefore two separate pro-\ncesses, and infection is crucially dependent on the latter. Sim-\nulation studies showed that the observed complement and an-\ntibody dose dependences are well explained by a hypothesis\ninvolving increased adhesion of complement-coated virions to\ntarget cells. Our previous work with antibody-mediated Fc\nreceptor-dependent enhancement (19) is also in accordance\nwith this conclusion.\nFIG. 6. Kinetics of HIV infection when HIV is incubated with cells for 5 to 1,440 min before being washed. Shown are the results for HIV preincubated for 1 h\nwith serum from an HIV-negative donor in a dilution of 1:100 and serum from an HIV-infected patient in a dilution of 1:1,000 before the addition of cells ({) and\nfor a mock-treated control (\u2014\u2014). Also shown are the effects of adding 2 mg of sCD4 to cells and HIV after 30 min of incubation in the cultures in which HIV was\nincubated with serum (h) and in the mock-treated control (3).

VIROL.\n\nEnhancement of MT-2 cells with HIV IIIB was shown to be\nmediated via the alternative complement activation pathway\nand increased in the presence of heat-inactivated serum from\nan HIV-infected donor. We found that infection, under\nC\u2019ADE conditions, reached a high level within minutes and did\nnot increase signi\ufb01cantly thereafter. Simulation studies showed\nthat this could be explained by a large excess of HIV-comple-\nment complexes which rapidly saturate the complement recep-\ntors, thus saturating the enhanced infection process. This is\npossible even though we used a low TCID50 relative to the\nnumber of complement receptors on the cells. Electron mi-\ncroscopy studies have shown that there are 104- to 107-fold\nmore physical than infectious virus particles (17). Further-\nmore, in binding assays, Monte\ufb01ori et al. (22) have shown that\nas much as 40% of the virus input was bound to the CR2-\npositive MT-2 cells in the presence of HIV-positive serum and\nfresh human serum. A peculiar consequence of this hypothesis\nis that even if all complement receptors are saturated, it is still\nonly a small fraction of the cells that are infected, as the\nTCID50 value under enhancing conditions was only 1,024, cor-\nresponding to an infection of approximately 0.2% of the cells.\nThe enhancement seen in the experiments in which no se-\nrum from an HIV-positive donor was added can be explained\nby antibody-independent activation of the alternative comple-\nment pathway (C\u2019AIDE). Experiments showed that fresh sera\nfrom normal human donors in many cases enhance HIV in-\nfection, while heat-inactivated sera neutralize infection (un-\npublished data). C\u2019ADE may have severe implications for vac-\ncine development, since antibody raised against all synthetic\npeptides encompassing the whole gp120 and gp41 sequence\nseem able to produce variable degrees of C\u2019ADE (13). Even\nantibodies raised against 10 of 21 strain-speci\ufb01c V3 loop pep-\ntides could enhance (13), thereby reducing the possibility of\n\ufb01nding a non-C\u2019ADE mediating epitope as a safe target for\nvaccine development.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Henriette Buch for excellent technical assistance.\nThis work was supported by the Danish 1991 Pharmacy Association,\nthe Danish Insurance Association, the Novo-Nordisk Foundation, the\nIngeborg Roikjers Foundation, the Hartmann Foundation, the John\nFIG. 7.

Experimental studies showed that while HIV-positive\nsera neutralize HIV infection, the addition of fresh complement abrogated neutralization and could even cause\nenhancement. Enhancement was blocked by anti-complement receptor 2 antibodies, and infection under\nenhancing conditions could be blocked by soluble CD4. Antibody-dependent complement-mediated enhance-\nment (C\u2019ADE) was dependent on the alternative complement activation pathway, as factor B-de\ufb01cient serum\ncould enhance only after the addition of factor B. The observed enhancement was also antibody dependent,\nsince the addition of antibodies increased the level of enhancement. Under C\u2019ADE conditions, infection reached\na plateau within 5 min and was not caused by activation of cells by factors in the human serum. On the\ncontrary, preincubation of cells with complement decreased the level of enhancement. A theoretical model of\nHIV infection in vitro which exhibited similar enhancement in an antibody- and complement concentration-\ndependent way was developed. Model studies indicated that the enhanced infection process could be explained\nby the fact that virions, because of complement deposition on the surface, bind more ef\ufb01ciently to cells. The\nmodel also indicated that the saturation of the enhanced infection process seen after a few minutes could be\ncaused by saturation of the complement receptors. The effect of neutralizing antibodies can thus be overcome\nby the enhancing effect of complement that facilitates the contact between gp120 and CD4. These studies\ndemonstrate that the main features of the complement-dependent enhancement phenomenon can be under-\nstood in terms of a simple mathematical model.\nComplement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement\n(C\u2019ADE) has been found in vitro both in sera from three of\nfour volunteers vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia virus ex-\npressing human immunode\ufb01ciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp160\nand boosted with baculovirus-derived recombinant gp160\n(rgp160) (20) and in 25% of healthy adults vaccinated with\nHIV-1 rgp160 (8). 1t is therefore possible that C\u2019ADE reduces\nor even reverses vaccine ef\ufb01cacy. HIV and HIV-infected cells\neither in conjunction with or independent of antibody can\nactivate the complement cascade by the classical or the alter-\nnative pathway (7). The complement system is chronically ac-\ntivated throughout the infection in vivo, probably resulting in\nthe reduced levels of complement found in HIV-infected pa-\ntients by several groups (7, 24). C\u2019ADE and complement-me-\ndiated antibody-independent enhancement (C\u2019AIDE) may\ncontribute to the in vivo pathogenesis of HIV infection. This\nhypothesis is supported by the \ufb01ndings that 10 to 50% of\nhuman CD41 T lymphocytes express complement receptor 2\n(CR2) and that this fraction is reduced during HIV infection,\nsuggesting that these CD41 CR21 T cells are selectively in-\nfected and killed either by direct cytopathic effects of HIV or\nby HIV-speci\ufb01c immunological mechanisms (14). Comple-\nment-coated cells have also been shown to be more sensitive to\nattack by natural killer cells (37). Although it has been re-\nported in several instances (26, 34), viral neutralization by\ncomplement-mediated lysis is still controversial (7, 33). 1t is generally believed that C\u2019ADE requires complement\nreceptors and CD4 receptors (30, 35), since C\u2019ADE can be\nblocked by antibodies against CR2 (10, 31) and CR3 (28).\nComplement-mediated binding to target cells seems indepen-\ndent of CD4 (1, 21, 22), but infection is generally believed to\nrequire CD4 receptors (7, 10, 11, 22), although CD4-indepen-\ndent C\u2019ADE infection of MT-2 cells has been reported (3, 7).\nAt least three fundamentally different hypotheses can be\nproposed to explain the observed enhancement phenomena.\n(i) Antibodies and/or complement may increase adhesion of\nHIV to complement receptor-bearing cells. C3 fragments de-\nposited on either gp41 (29, 30) or other epitopes (13), classi-\ncally (normally antibody dependently) or alternatively (nor-\nmally antibody independently), could increase the binding of\nHIV to target cells possessing complement receptors (CR2 in\nthe case of MT-2 cells) and thereby facilitate the contact be-\ntween gp120 and cell-associated CD4, causing increased virus\nuptake (1) and provirus formation (15). (ii) Complement\nbound to virus may facilitate HIV-cell fusion. (iii) Comple-\nment deposited on HIV may have nonspeci\ufb01c stimulatory ef-\nfects on target cells, such as increasing cellular metabolism and\nvirus production. C3a and C5a, which stimulate many immune\ncells, are released during complement activation and could\nhave such effects. Alternatively, cells may also be stimulated by\nCR2 cross-linking or CR2 and CD4 cross-linking caused by\ncomplement deposition on cells (15). 1t is not trivial to predict the effect of antibodies and com-\nplement on HIV infection, since both have been shown to have\n* Corresponding author.

We have previously\nshown that antibody-dependent enhancement of HIV infection\nof U937 cells is well explained by a mathematical model based\non a hypothesis of increased adhesion of antibody-coated viri-\nons to target cells (19). 1n this study we have investigated the\nmechanisms of complement and antibody-dependent enhance-\nment of HIV 1IIB infection of MT-2 cells experimentally and\nexamined whether a mathematical model based on the ob-\nserved phenomena shows similar infection kinetics and anti-\nbody and complement dose dependence.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCells and virus. The human T-lymphoblastoid cell line used in the experiments\nwas MT-2, a human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-I)-transformed CD41\nand CR21 cell line (repository reference ADP014 obtained from the Medical\nResearch Council, MRC, London, England). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640\ncontaining 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 1U of penicillin per ml,\n20 mg of gentamicin per ml, and 100 1U of streptomycin (growth medium) at a\ndensity of 0.2 3 106 to 1.2 3 106 cells per ml, and maintained at 378C and 5%\nCO2. The HIV-1 laboratory strain HIV 1IIB (obtained from R. C. Gallo, Na-\ntional Cancer 1nstitute, Bethesda, Md.) was obtained as a supernatant from\nfreshly infected H9 cells (25). Supernatants were harvested, \ufb01ltered (pore size,\n0.45 mm), aliquotted, and stored at 2808 until use. The approximate 50% tissue\nculture infectious dose (TCID50) of HIV 1IIB was calculated by end point\ntitration with MT-2 cells by the method of Reed and Muench (27). Cells (5 3\n105) were inoculated with a \ufb01vefold dilution series of virus for 3 h and then\nextensively washed and cultured in quadruplicates of 5 3 104 cells. The HIV\nantigen concentrations in the supernatants were determined by HIV antigen\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described below.\nELISA for HIV antigen. Cell-free culture supernatants were examined for HIV\nantigen with a biotin-avidin potentiated double-antibody ELISA with human\nimmunoglobulin G against HIV, as described previously (12, 23). Each plate\nincluded a dilution series of a standard HIV antigen preparation, and optical\ndensities were expressed relative to this standard in arbitrary units.\nSera and reagents. Human serum used as a complement source (i.e., fresh\nhuman serum) was collected from an HIV-negative donor, aliquotted, and stored\nat 2808C until use. For neutralization, HIV 1IIB neutralizing serum (anti-HIV\nserum) was obtained from an HIV-positive patient. Serum was heat inactivated\nat 568C for 30 min, aliquotted, and stored at 2208C. Further, a serum sample was\nfreshly frozen and stored at 2808C to be used as an autologous complement\nsource. Factor B-de\ufb01cient serum, factor B, and a standard serum were purchased\nfrom Sigma (catalog numbers C0535, C4909, and C2038, respectively). Mono-\nclonal antibodies directed to CR2 (OKB7) and CD4 (OKT4) were purchased\nfrom Ortho Diagnostic Systems (Raritan, N.J.; catalog numbers 700720 and\n700420, respectively). All antibodies were dialyzed and \ufb01ltered (pore size, 0.22\nmm) before use. Recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4), produced in CHO cells, was\nobtained from Neosystem Laboratoire, Strassbourg, France (catalog number SC\n925100). 1nfection neutralization and enhancement assay. To determine whether en-\nhancement occurred, a dilution series of anti-HIV serum was mixed with a\ndilution series of complement, and then 25 TCID50 of HIV 1IIB was added. After\npreincubation for 1 h at 378C, 5 3 105 MT-2 cells in growth medium were added\nand inoculated for 3 h at 378C. After an extensive washing, cells were resus-\npended in 2 ml of growth medium, and quadruplicates of 5 3 104 cells were\ntransferred to a 96-well cell culture plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), and plates\nwere incubated at 378C in 5% CO2 for 4 days. Supernatants were then harvested,\nand the HIV antigen concentration was measured.\nUnless otherwise stated, experiments were performed at least twice with iden-\ntical results. Means of quadruplicates were compared by a Student\u2019s t test (two-\nsided), allowing for unequal variances.\nModel formulation. The model is based on an in vitro system in which a\npopulation of target cells is infected by a population of HIV virions. 1t is an\nextension of the model proposed by Lund et al. (19) for antibody-mediated\nenhancement. Target cells and HIV are present in a supernatant in concentra-\ntions M and V, respectively. 1t is assumed that the concentration of target cells,\nM, is constant. The concentration of live virions is assumed to decay exponen-\ntially at a per capita rate, kn. The concentration of free live virions will also\ndiminish because of adhesion to the target cells at rate kaMV, thus giving rise to\na population of cell-bound virions, the concentration of which we shall denote as\nB. ka is the time-dependent association rate for the complex formation. The\nadhered virions will infect the cells at rate kiB, where ki is the infection rate per\nadhered virion. The concentration of cell-bound virions is also assumed to\ndecrease because of inactivation of the adhered virus at rate knB. The concen-\ntration of infected cells, which we shall denote as 1, rises at a rate equal to the\ninfection by cell-bound virions. 1t is assumed that the multiplicity of infection is\nlow. The above assumptions lead to the following equations:\ndB\ndt 5 kaMV 2 knB 2 kiB\n(1)\ndI\ndt 5 kiB\n(2)\ndV\ndt 5 2 kaMV 2 knV\n(3)\nThe rate of reaction, ka, can be calculated as the product of the maximum rate\nconstant for diffusion-limited aggregation, kd, and the probability of reaction, Pa.\nkd 5 4p(Dc 1 Dv) (rc 1 rv), where D and r are the diffusion constants and radii\nfor cells (subscript c) and virus (subscript v), respectively (4). The diffusion\nconstant for a particle with radius r is D 5 kT/6phr, where k is the Boltzman\nconstant, T is the absolute temperature, and h is the viscosity of the liquid in\nwhich the particle diffuses (4). As shown by Berg and Purcell (2), the probability\n(Pa) that a small molecule which has arrived at the surface of a cell will \ufb01nd a\nreceptor to bind to can be estimated as Pa 5 Nrr/(Nrr 1 prc). Here, N is the\nnumber of receptors on the cell surface to which the small molecule can bind,\nand rr is the functional radius of these receptors, i.e., the radius within which the\nsmall molecule has to be in order to bind to the receptor. A similar result was\nobtained by Shoup and Szabo (32) by a different approach in which they used the\nresult obtained by Collins and Kimball (5) that the forward reaction rate for a\nligand to a partly reacting sphere (ka) can be written as ka 5 kdk/(kd 1 k). By\nchoosing the Collins-Kimball constant k as N4Ds, where N is the number of\nreceptors on the cell surface and 4Ds is the reaction rate of a point ligand to a\nsingle reactive circular site with radius s on an in\ufb01nite unreactive surface, Shoup\nand Szabo immediately recover the result obtained by Berg and Purcell. To\nextend this \ufb01nding to a virus only partly covered with ligands for receptors on the\ncell, the Collins-Kimball constant is rede\ufb01ned as\nk 5 4DO\ni\nfiNisi\n(4)\nwhere fi is the fraction of the virus covered with ligand for the receptor of type\ni of which there are Ni on the cell surface. We thus obtain\nPa 5 O\ni~fiNisi!\nO\ni~fiNisi! 1 prc\n(5) 1n the case of HIV, the fraction of the surface that can bind to CD4 is\nfc 5\nNgrg\n2\n4rv\n2\n(6)\nwhere Ng and rg are the number and radius of gp120 molecules on the surface of\nan HIV virion, respectively. 1n this equation it is assumed that the binding of\nantibody to gp120 does not block the binding of gp120 to CD4. Correspondingly,\nthe fraction of the viral surface that can bind to complement receptors on the cell\nsurface is\nfk 5\nNkrk\n2ck\n4rv\n2\n(7)\nwhere Nk is the number of sites on the virus where complement can bind and rk\nis the radius of the complement receptor-binding site on deposited complement.\nck is the fraction of complement-binding sites occupied. The probability of\nadhesion (Pa) for this two-receptor system is\nPa 5\nfcNCDrCD 1 fkNCRrCR\nfcNCDrCD 1 fkNCRrCR 1 prc\n(8)\nHere rCD and rCR are the radii of the CD4 and the complement receptors,\nrespectively. Using a quasi-steady-state assumption, the numbers of free CD4\nreceptors (NCD) and complement receptors (NCR) are calculated as\nNCD 5 max~0,NCDt 2 bBNg/M!\n(9)\nNCR 5 max~0,NCRt 2 bBNkck/M!\n(10)\nwhere NCDt and NCRt are the average number of CD4 and CR2 receptors on the\ncells, respectively, and Nkck is the average number of complement molecules on\neach virion. 1n the above equation it is assumed that HIV binds to a cell with the\nligands on a contact surface which is assumed to cover a fraction (b) of the virion\nsurface.\nUnder the assumption of antibody excess, the fraction of gp120 molecules\ncomplexed with antibodies (ca) can be calculated as (6, 19).\nca 5\na\n1/km 1 a\n(11)\nwhere a is the concentration of antibodies and km is the equilibrium constant for\n2394\nLUND ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nthe reaction. Similarly, the fraction of complement-binding sites occupied (ck) is\nwritten\nck 5\nK\nk2/~k1 1 k2ca! 1 K\n(12)\nwhere K is the concentration of complement relative to the concentration of\ncomplement in normal human serum, and k2 is the dissociation rate for com-\nplement. The association rate is assumed to be a linear combination of an\nantibody-independent term (k1) and an antibody-dependent one (k2ca). Further-\nmore, we assume that HIV infects the cells that it has adhered to at a per capita\nrate (ki) proportional to the number of non-antibody-complexed gp120 mole-\ncules on the viral surface:\nki 5 ki0~1 2 ca!g\n(13)\nHere ki0 is the infection rate for a virion with no gp120 complexed with anti-\nbodies, and it is assumed that a fraction (g 5 1026) is infectious. This value of\ng lies in the range found by Layne et al. (17).\nThe parameters used in the simulations are listed in Table 1. Simulations of\nthe model were performed on a 66 MHz, 486 PC with a \ufb01ve-stage Runge-Kutta\nformula pair, RKN(3,4) (9), implemented in Borland Pascal (c) to solve the set\nof coupled nonlinear equations.\nRESULTS 1n vitro experiments. (i) Enhancement or inhibition de-\npends on concentrations of antibodies and complement. The\ninfection enhancement and inhibition assays were performed\nwith MT-2 cells. HIV 1IIB was preincubated with various con-\ncentrations of antibodies from heat-inactivated serum from an\nHIV-1-infected patient and complement from fresh serum\nfrom an uninfected donor. Table 2 and Fig. 1 show the effects\nof combinations of antibodies and complement on the infec-\ntion. When no complement was added, a dose-dependent neu-\ntralization as a function of the antibody concentration was seen\n(P , 0.01 when the dilution of antibody was less than 1:1,000).\nWhen no antibody was added, a dose-dependent enhancement\nas a function of the complement concentration was seen (P ,\n0.01 for a dilution of 1:10). For combinations of antibody and\ncomplement, the highest enhancement was seen for antibodies\nin a dilution of 1:1,000 and complement in a dilution of 1:10.\n(ii) Diluted complement from an HIV-1-infected patient can\nenhance infection. To evaluate whether fresh serum from an\nHIV-1-infected patient can enhance infection, combinations of\nfresh serum and heat-inactivated serum from the same HIV-\n1-infected patient were tested for enhancing and neutralizing\neffects. Table 3 and Fig. 2 show that when the dilution of serum\n(fresh plus heat inactivated) was lower than or equal to 1:10 or\nwhen only heat-inactivated serum was added, neutralization\nwas seen; otherwise, enhancement was seen.\n(iii) Enhancement can be blocked by heat inactivation of\nserum or by anti-CR2 antibodies. Enhancement is abrogated\nand antibody-mediated neutralization is regained during infec-\ntion with heat-inactivated sera, as seen in Fig. 2. To evaluate\nthe involvement of CR2, MT-2 cells were preincubated with\nthe monoclonal anti-CR2 antibody OKB7 for 1 h, and then\nFIG. 1. Three-dimensional plot of the relative level of infection.

The enhancement found\nwhen HIV was preincubated with complement in a dilution of\n1:100 and HIV-positive serum in a dilution of 1:1,000 relative\nto a control to which no serum was added was decreased\n2.7-fold by preincubating the cells with anti-CR2 antibodies\n(OKB7), but not with an indifferent antibody (OKT4), indicat-\ning that enhancement of MT-2 cells by HIV-1 1IIB is comple-\nment mediated and requires CR2.\n(iv) 1nfection under enhancing conditions can be blocked\nwith sCD4. To delineate whether gp120 binding to CD4 is\nnecessary for infection, we tested the effect on infection of\npreincubating HIV for 1 h with various dilutions of sCD4\ntogether with complement in a dilution of 1:100 and/or anti-\nbodies in a dilution of 1:1,000, before the addition of cells for\n3 h. Both with enhancing concentrations of antibodies and/or\ncomplement and with the control, a dose-dependent neutral-\nizing effect was seen (Fig. 3). Thus, CR2 is not an alternative\nreceptor which renders MT-2 cells permissive to HIV without\ninteraction with the CD4 receptor.\n(v) Enhancement is mediated via the alternative comple-\nment activation pathway. To evaluate whether enhancement\noccurred by the classical or the alternative pathway, HIV was\npreincubated with a dilution series of factor B-de\ufb01cient serum\nwhich is de\ufb01cient in the alternative complement activation\npathway. Preincubating HIV with factor B-de\ufb01cient serum\n(Sigma) gave no enhancement in the presence or absence of\nheat inactivated serum from an HIV-1-infected donor in a\ndilution of 1:1,000 (Fig. 4). Enhancement was seen after res-\ntoration of the alternative pathway by the addition of factor B\n(P , 0.05) during preincubation, and the enhancement was\nampli\ufb01ed in the presence of HIV-positive serum (P , 0.05).\nThe addition of factor B to normal, fresh human serum did not\nalter the level of infection (data not shown).\n(vi) 1nfection under C\u2019ADE conditions increases the virus\ntiter 27-fold. Preincubating HIV in a twofold dilution series\nwith HIV-positive serum in a dilution of 1:1,000 and fresh\nhuman serum in a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h before the addition\nof cells for 3 h resulted in an end point virus titer 27-fold higher\n(titer 5 1,024) than that in a control to which no serum was\nadded (titer 5 37).\n(vii) Enhancement is not due to activation of cells by factors\nin serum. 1n order to examine whether enhancement could be\ndue to serum factors activating the cells to become more sus-\nceptible to HIV infection or inclined to produce more virus, we\npreincubated the cells with heat-inactivated HIV-positive se-\nrum in a dilution of 1:1,000 and/or fresh human complement in\na dilution of 1:100 for 30 min before a washing and subsequent\nincubation with virus for 3 h. These pretreatments did not alter\nthe level of infection (P . 0.3 relative to the control to which\nno serum was added). 1n contrast, preincubation of virus with\ncomplement or serum plus complement for 3 h increased the\nlevel of infection signi\ufb01cantly (P , 0.01), and inoculation in the\npresence of antibodies alone decreased the infection (P ,\n0.05) relative to that in a control to which no serum was added\n(Fig. 5).\n(viii) 1nfection under C\u2019ADE conditions reaches maximum\nlevel within 5 min after incubation. To determine the kinetics\nFIG. 2. Three-dimensional plot of the level of infection as a function of\ndilution series of antibodies (S) and complement (C), from the data listed in\nTable 3.

VIROL.\n\nof HIV infection, an assay in which HIV was allowed to bind to\nthe MT-2 cells for 5 to 1,440 min before being washed was\nperformed. Under C\u2019ADE conditions, the infection reached a\nhigh level within 5 min and increased slowly, though not sig-\nni\ufb01cantly (P . 0.05), thereafter (Fig. 6). The addition of sCD4\nafter 30 min did not lead to a signi\ufb01cantly (P . 0.05) lower\ninfection rate. Without HIV-positive serum and complement,\nthe infection rate started to rise after 30 min and reached a\nmaximum level after 1,080 min, and the infection was blocked\nwhen sCD4 was added after 30 min (P , 0.05). Calculation of\nthe diffusion-limited aggregation rate (kaM) shows that it takes\napproximately 30 min before half of the virions have encoun-\ntered a cell. The saturation of the infection process seen under\nC\u2019ADE conditions after only 5 min can therefore not be due to\na major part of the HIV particles being bound to cells. We\ntherefore wanted to determine whether the abrogation of the\nenhanced infection process could be due to complement sat-\nurating the complement receptors. Cells, virus, or both were\npreincubated with complement prior to incubation of cells with\nvirus for 3 h. Table 4 shows that preincubation of cells for 30\nmin with fresh serum from an HIV-negative donor did not\nenhance, while virus preincubated for 1 h with the serum did.\nWhen virus was preincubated with complement, the addition\nof complement to cells resulted in a reduced level of enhance-\nment, indicating that complement competed for complement\nreceptors.\nFIG. 4. Effects of factor B-de\ufb01cient serum on infection. HIV was preincubated with various combinations of HIV-positive serum (S), fresh human serum from Sigma\n(C), factor B-de\ufb01cient serum from Sigma (C b-def) and factor B (B). Shown are S 1 C ({), S 1 C b-def (\u2014\u2014), S 1 C b-def 1 B (h), C b-def (3), C b-def 1 B (\u00c7),\nand the control (complement 5 0).

(i) The rapid saturation of the enhanced\ninfection process may be due to saturation of complement\nreceptors. Figure 7 shows a model simulation of the number of\nvirions bound to cells under enhancing conditions and under\ncontrol conditions as a function of the incubation time.\nThe reason for the faster reaction under enhancing condi-\ntions in the model simulation is that a larger fraction of the\nHIV surface is covered by complement than is covered by\ngp120. Saturation of the infection process occurs, since a major\npart of the complement receptors is occupied by HIV-associ-\nated complement.\n(ii) The model qualitatively explains the experimental re-\nsults. Figure 8 shows simulation results for the combined ef-\nfects of antibodies and complement. 1t can be seen that the\nmodel captures the main features of the experimental data\nshown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Note that the antibody titer giving\nthe maximal enhancement increases as the complement is di-\nluted, corresponding to the experimental results shown in Fig.\n1. At high complement concentrations, less antibody is needed\nto obtain high-level saturation of HIV with complement. For\nthe model to show enhancement when the concentration of\nantibodies is set to zero, we need to assume either that com-\nplement can bind to HIV in the absence of antibodies as in Fig.\n8 or alternatively that the complement serum contains heter-\nologous antibodies that can facilitate complement binding to\nHIV.\nDISCUSSION\nComplement-mediated enhancement can be explained by at\nleast three mechanisms: (i) antibody and/or complement may\nincrease the binding of virus to target cells, (ii) they may\nincrease the fusion of HIV with cells, or (iii) they may have\nnonspeci\ufb01c stimulatory effects on target cells. These mecha-\nnisms might also act to render otherwise inert virions infec-\ntious. When cells were preincubated with complement and\nthen washed, we did not \ufb01nd any alteration of the level of\ninfection, indicating that enhancement was not due to activa-\ntion of the cells. Our results, indicating that the mechanism of\nenhancement is well explained by the increased adhesion to\ntarget cell CR2s after complement deposition on HIV, are in\naccordance with those of Monte\ufb01ori et al. (21), who found that\nbinding of HIV to CR21 MT-2 and Raji-3 cells increased after\npretreatment with complement. Our \ufb01nding that the infection\nwas still sensitive to sCD4 is also in accordance with the results\nof Monte\ufb01ori et al. (21), who could not infect Raji-3 cells\nwhich are CD42 CR21. Thus, complement might act to get a\nlarger fraction of the virions into close proximity of target cell\nCD4 receptors, thus enabling them to infect. Adhesion of HIV\nto the cell surface via complement, Fc, or alternative receptors\nand speci\ufb01c binding to CD4 are therefore two separate pro-\ncesses, and infection is crucially dependent on the latter. Sim-\nulation studies showed that the observed complement and an-\ntibody dose dependences are well explained by a hypothesis\ninvolving increased adhesion of complement-coated virions to\ntarget cells. Our previous work with antibody-mediated Fc\nreceptor-dependent enhancement (19) is also in accordance\nwith this conclusion.\nFIG. 6. Kinetics of HIV infection when HIV is incubated with cells for 5 to 1,440 min before being washed. Shown are the results for HIV preincubated for 1 h\nwith serum from an HIV-negative donor in a dilution of 1:100 and serum from an HIV-infected patient in a dilution of 1:1,000 before the addition of cells ({) and\nfor a mock-treated control (\u2014\u2014). Also shown are the effects of adding 2 mg of sCD4 to cells and HIV after 30 min of incubation in the cultures in which HIV was\nincubated with serum (h) and in the mock-treated control (3).

VIROL.\n\nEnhancement of MT-2 cells with HIV 1IIB was shown to be\nmediated via the alternative complement activation pathway\nand increased in the presence of heat-inactivated serum from\nan HIV-infected donor. We found that infection, under\nC\u2019ADE conditions, reached a high level within minutes and did\nnot increase signi\ufb01cantly thereafter. Simulation studies showed\nthat this could be explained by a large excess of HIV-comple-\nment complexes which rapidly saturate the complement recep-\ntors, thus saturating the enhanced infection process. This is\npossible even though we used a low TCID50 relative to the\nnumber of complement receptors on the cells. Electron mi-\ncroscopy studies have shown that there are 104- to 107-fold\nmore physical than infectious virus particles (17). Further-\nmore, in binding assays, Monte\ufb01ori et al. (22) have shown that\nas much as 40% of the virus input was bound to the CR2-\npositive MT-2 cells in the presence of HIV-positive serum and\nfresh human serum. A peculiar consequence of this hypothesis\nis that even if all complement receptors are saturated, it is still\nonly a small fraction of the cells that are infected, as the\nTCID50 value under enhancing conditions was only 1,024, cor-\nresponding to an infection of approximately 0.2% of the cells.\nThe enhancement seen in the experiments in which no se-\nrum from an HIV-positive donor was added can be explained\nby antibody-independent activation of the alternative comple-\nment pathway (C\u2019AIDE). Experiments showed that fresh sera\nfrom normal human donors in many cases enhance HIV in-\nfection, while heat-inactivated sera neutralize infection (un-\npublished data). C\u2019ADE may have severe implications for vac-\ncine development, since antibody raised against all synthetic\npeptides encompassing the whole gp120 and gp41 sequence\nseem able to produce variable degrees of C\u2019ADE (13). Even\nantibodies raised against 10 of 21 strain-speci\ufb01c V3 loop pep-\ntides could enhance (13), thereby reducing the possibility of\n\ufb01nding a non-C\u2019ADE mediating epitope as a safe target for\nvaccine development.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Henriette Buch for excellent technical assistance.\nThis work was supported by the Danish 1991 Pharmacy Association,\nthe Danish 1nsurance Association, the Novo-Nordisk Foundation, the 1ngeborg Roikjers Foundation, the Hartmam Foundation, the John\nFIG. 7.

All three OBP\nbinding sites are upstream of the palindrome in contrast to the sequence of the herpes simplex virus oriS,\nwhich has required OBP binding sites upstream and downstream of the AT-rich region. We are investigating\nthe roles that sequences downstream of the palindrome play in VZV oriS-dependent DNA replication. Com-\nputer analysis identi\ufb01ed two GC boxes, GC box 1 and GC box 2, in the downstream region which were predicted\nto be binding sites for the cellular transcription factor Sp1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift\nassays showed that two members of the Sp family (Sp1 and Sp3) stably bind to GC box 1, but not to GC box\n2. A predicted binding site for the cellular factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) that overlaps with GC box 2 was also\nidenti\ufb01ed. Supershift and mutational analyses con\ufb01rmed the binding of YY1 to this site. Mutation of GC box\n1 resulted in loss of Sp1 and Sp3 binding and an increase in origin-dependent replication ef\ufb01ciency in DpnI\nreplication assays. 1n contrast, mutation of the YY1 site had a statistically insigni\ufb01cant effect. These results\nsuggest a model where origin-dependent DNA replication and viral transcription are coupled by the binding\nof Sp1 and Sp3 to the downstream region of the VZV replication origin during lytic infection. They may also\nhave implications regarding establishment or reactivation of viral latency.\nVaricella-zoster virus (VZV) is a member of the Alphaher-\npesvirus subfamily of the Herpesviridae family. VZV is the caus-\native agent of two types of disease, chicken pox (varicella)\nupon primary infection and shingles (zoster) after reactivation\nfrom latency (1, 2). The VZV genome consists of 125 kbp\nwhich encodes approximately 69 open reading frames (ORFs).\nThe viral genome is made up of long and short unique seg-\nments designated UL and US, respectively, both of which are\nbounded by inverted repeat sequences (11). The linear se-\nquence of VZV genes is similar to that of herpes simplex virus\ntype 1 (HSV-1) and includes the coding sequences for ortho-\nlogues of the seven HSV-1 proteins required for origin-depen-\ndent DNA replication (9).\nThe VZV genome contains two origins of DNA replication\n(oriS) within the internal repeats (IRs) and terminal repeats\n(TRs) bounding the US segment at sites analogous to those\nwithin the HSV-1 genome. VZV, however, lacks the third\nHSV-1 origin (oriL), which is located near the center of the\nHSV-1 UL region (10, 11, 48, 49). HSV-1 oriL has been shown\nto be dispensable for replication of HSV DNA (3, 53) but has\nbeen implicated in HSV pathogenesis and reactivation from\nlatency (4). The equivalent region in the VZV genome is\ncomprised of a bidirectional promoter that regulates the tran-\nscription of the VZV DNA polymerase catalytic subunit\n(ORF28) and DNA binding protein (ORF29) genes (32, 54).\nThe architecture of the VZV and HSV-1 oriS regions differs\nsigni\ufb01cantly (Fig. 1). The two VZV oriS regions contain an\nAT-rich palindrome and three consensus 10-bp binding sites\n[5\u0002-C(G/A)TTCGCACT-3\u0002] for the VZV origin binding pro-\ntein (OBP) encoded by VZV ORF51 located upstream of the\nAT-rich palindrome (48, 50). These binding sites, designated\nboxes A, B, and C are identical or nearly identical to the\nconsensus site for the HSV-1 UL9 OBP with which the VZV\nORF51 OBP shares 54.8% similarity and 46.5% identity (8,\n50). All three OBP binding sites in the VZV origin are ori-\nented in the same direction and are present on the same strand\nof the viral DNA. Origin-dependent DNA replication in VZV\nrequires the AT-rich region and box A. Box C is not essential,\nbut its presence increases replication ef\ufb01ciency, while box B\nappears to be completely dispensable (48, 50). Nothing is cur-\nrently known regarding the role played by sequences down-\nstream of the VZV minimal origin in viral DNA replication. A\npartial (7 of 10 bp) OBP binding site is present downstream of\nthe AT-rich palindrome with the same orientation and on the\nsame strand as the upstream OBP boxes. However, gel shift\nand DNase 1 protection assays failed to demonstrate VZV\nOBP binding to this sequence (8, 50). 1n contrast, in the HSV-1\noriS, binding sites for the UL9 OBP (boxes 1, 1I, and 1II) occur\nboth upstream and downstream of the AT-rich region. Boxes 1\nand 1I are located upstream and downstream on opposite\nstrands of the DNA and are oriented in opposite directions.\nBox 1II is located upstream of box 1 but is oriented in the same\ndirection and occurs on the same DNA strand as box 1I. Mu-\ntational analysis has shown that the minimal HSV-1 requires\nthe presence of both box 1 and box 1I and the central AT-rich\nregion (4, 12, 49, 52).\nThe structural differences between the VZV and HSV-1 oriS\nin terms of the positioning and orientation of the OBP binding\nsites suggest that the mechanism and/or transacting factors\n* Corresponding author.

One possi-\nbility raised by Stow et al. (50) is that cellular factors or as yet\nunidenti\ufb01ed viral proteins could bind downstream of the AT-\nrich region in the VZV oriS to facilitate unwinding of the\norigin and assembly of the viral DNA replication machinery.\nThere is precedence for this possibility based on work with\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV), HSV-1, simian virus 40 (SV40), and\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV). The cellular transcription factor\nSp1 binds to the downstream region of EBV ORILyt and phys-\nically interacts with the EBV DNA polymerase catalytic and\naccessory subunits, increasing their recruitment and resulting\nin a positive effect on DNA replication (5, 15). Sp1 and the\nrelated factor Sp3 bind to the upstream region of the HSV-1\noriS at a cis element, designated OscarL, and also have a\npositive effect on origin-dependent DNA replication, although\nthe speci\ufb01c mechanism remains unknown (37). Several tran-\nscription factors were found to stimulate SV40 DNA replica-\ntion, including NF1, AP1, and Sp1 (16). Sp1 has also been\nreported (13) to enhance replication of human papillomavirus\ntype 18 (HPV18). 1n contrast, the transcription factor Yin\nYang 1 (YY1) has been shown to suppress HPV DNA repli-\ncation through interference with the function of the HPV E2\nprotein (25). 1n the work presented here, we identi\ufb01ed and authenticated\nthe presence of binding sites for cellular transcription factors\nwithin the downstream region of the VZV oriS and tested the\neffects of mutations of those sequences on VZV origin-depen-\ndent replication. Our data show that the cellular factors Sp1,\nSp3, and YY1 stably bind to different portions of the down-\nstream region of the VZV oriS. YY1 appears to have no effect\non origin-dependent replication. However, mutation of the\nSp1/Sp3 site that ablates binding of these factors resulted in an\nincrease in replication in in situ DpnI replication assays. This\nindicates that Sp1 and Sp3 act to suppress VZV oriS-depen-\ndent replication in contrast to what has been observed, as\ndescribed above, in other virus systems. Further, this repre-\nsents the \ufb01rst documentation of a role for Sp3 in VZV infec-\ntion.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCells and viruses. MeWo cells, a human melanoma cell line that supports the\nreplication of VZV, were grown in Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium supple-\nmented with 10% fetal bovine serum as previously described (47). VZV strain\nMSP was propagated in MeWo cell monolayers as described by Lynch et al. (29)\nand Peng et al. (39).\nNuclear and whole-cell lysates. Nuclear extracts of VZV-infected and unin-\nfected MeWo cells were prepared as previously described (29). Brie\ufb02y, pelleted\ncells were washed once with 30 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. Packed\ncells were resuspended in one packed cell volume of buffer A (10 mM HEPES\n[pH 7.9], 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) at 4\u00b0C and allowed\nto swell on ice for 15 min. Cells were then lysed by 10 rapid passages through a\n25-gauge hypodermic syringe, and the homogenate was sedimented brie\ufb02y at\n12,000 \u0003 g. The crude nuclear pellet was resuspended in two-thirds of one\npacked cell volume (determined at the time of cell harvest) of buffer C (20 mM\nHEPES [pH 7.9], 25% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM\nEDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \ufb02uoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol), and the\nresulting solution was incubated on ice with stirring for 30 min. The nuclear\ndebris was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 \u0003 g, and the supernatant\n(nuclear extract) was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 20%\n[vol/vol] glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl\n\ufb02uoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) for 2 h. The dialyzed extract was then quick-\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u000470\u00b0C. Whole-cell lysates of VZV-\ninfected and uninfected MeWo cells were prepared as previously described (39).\nCells were grown to con\ufb02uence in 100-mm petri dishes, washed with phosphate-\nbuffered saline buffer, and then suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH\n7.5], 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor\ncocktail [Roche, Mannheim, Germany] added per the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntion). The lysates were collected and centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatants\nwere stored at \u000470\u00b0C for subsequent use. 1mmunoblot analyses. Whole-cell lysates of VZV-infected and uninfected\nMeWo cells were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-10% polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis and immunoblotting for the presence of Sp family members and\nYY1 as described by Yang et al. (55). Antibodies against Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Sp4, and\n\u0005-tubulin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).\nAntibody against Sp1 was also obtained from Upstate (Temecula, CA). Rabbit\npolyclonal antibody against YY1 was generously supplied by Te-Chung Lee\n(University at Buffalo). Reactive bands were visualized using goat anti-rabbit\nFIG. 1.

Quanti\ufb01cation of the relative amounts of these\ntranscription factors normalized to \u0005-tubulin in loading controls was performed\nusing a Bio-Rad GS700 imagining densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Sta-\ntistical signi\ufb01cance was determined by a one-way analysis of variance, followed by\nTukey\u2019s post hoc test.\nPlasmids. The pVO2 plasmid containing a 259-bp fragment encompassing\nnucleotides 5502 to 5760 of the TRs/IRs sequence of the VZV Dumas strain (10)\nwas generously supplied by Nigel Stow (MRC Virology Unit, 1nstitute of Virol-\nogy, University of Glasgow). This fragment contains the VZV oriS region in-\ncluding OBP boxes C and A, the AT-rich palindrome, and 125 bp of downstream\nsequence. The pVO2 parental plasmid, pAT153, was purchased from MoBiTec\n(Goettingen, Germany).\nPlasmids containing GC box 1 and YY1 and box A substitution mutations\nwithin the oriS region were generated by mutation of pVO2 using the\nQuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the\nfollowing primer sets: primers 5\u0002-ATGTCGCGGTTTTATGGGGTGTTCGCG\nGGCTTTTCACAGAATATA-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-TATATTCTGTGAAAAGCCCGCG\nAACACCCCATAAAACCGCGACAT-3\u0002 for GC box 1, primers 5\u0002-ACAGAA\nTATATATATTCCAAATTTAGCGGCAGGCTTTTTAAAATC-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-G\nATTTTAAAAAGCCTGCCGCTAAATTTGGAATATATATATTCTGT-3\u0002\nfor YY1, and primers 5\u0002-GGCATGTGTCCAACCACCGTTAAAACTTTCTT\nTCTATATATATAT-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-ATATATATATAGAAAGAAAGTTTTAACG\nGTGGTTGGACACATGCC-3\u0002 for box A. All primers were synthesized by 1DT\n(Coralville, 1A). The positions and sequences of the mutations in the VZV oriS\nsequence contained within the pVO2 plasmid used in transfections were veri\ufb01ed\nby sequencing at the Roswell Park sequencing facility.\nDpnI replication assays. MeWo cells were transfected with Lipofectamine\nreagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nFour microliters of Lipofectamine reagent was used per microgram of trans-\nfected DNA in each transfection. 1n transfections performed in 100-mm-diam-\neter petri dishes, 2.1 \u0003 106 MeWo cells per dish were seeded in 12 ml of\ncomplete growth medium. The cells were 80% con\ufb02uent at the time of transfec-\ntion. Three hours before transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh\nmedium. Replication experiments were performed as described by Stow and\nMcMonagle (49) and Stow and Davison (48). The cells were transfected with 5\n\u0006g of wild-type or mutant pVO2 plasmids. At 6 h posttransfection, cells were\nsuperinfected with VZV strain MSP. VZV superinfections were performed by\nadding a ratio of 0.4 infected cell per 1 uninfected cell of the infected cells to\neach monolayer. Total cellular DNA was prepared 48 h after superinfection by\nthe addition of 5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 0.5%\nsodium dodecyl sulfate, 20 \u0006g/ml RNase 1) per dish. Lysates were transferred to\n15-ml conical test tubes and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Proteinase K in TE buffer\n(10 mM Tris-HCl and 0.001 M EDTA) was added to a \ufb01nal concentration of 100\n\u0006g per ml, and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 0.15 M. The mixture was\nthen incubated at 50\u00b0C for 3 h. The DNA was isolated by phenol chloroform\nextraction, followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was digested with DpnI\nand EcoRI as described by Stow and Davison (48) and analyzed by Southern blot\nhybridization. Transfers were done using TurboBlotter kits obtained from What-\nman, 1nc. (Sanford, ME). The blots were probed with a 400-bp PCR product\nprepared from pVO2 using primers 5\u0002-GTGCTCCTGTCGTTGAGGACCCG\nG-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-CCTCTGACTTGAGCGTCGATTTTT-3\u0002 and end labeled with[\u0007-\n32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This fragment includes a\nportion (nucleotide positions 1465 to 1864) of the pVO2 plasmid containing the\nColE1 origin of replication and was designed to detect both intact DpnI-resistant\nlinearized pVO2 (3.9 kb) resulting from replication of the input plasmid and an\n872-bp fragment resulting from the DpnI-sensitive unreplicated input plasmid.\nThe resulting bands were quanti\ufb01ed by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics,\nSunnyvale, CA) analysis. The ratio of replicated plasmid to input plasmid rep-\nresented the replication ef\ufb01ciency of the test plasmid. The data from represen-\ntative experiments are presented as means of triplicate DpnI replications. Error\nbars indicate standard errors. Statistical signi\ufb01cance was determined by a one-\nway analysis of variance followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test.\nEMSA and supershift analyses. Thirty-base-pair oligonucleotide probes (IDT,\nCoralville, 1A) containing wild-type and mutant GC box 1 elements and 40-bp\nprobes containing wild-type and mutant YY1 and GC box 2 binding site elements\nwere used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Probes were end\nlabeled with [\u0007-32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For the GC\nbox 1 probes, 100 femtomoles of the 30-bp labeled probes containing wild-type\nand mutant GC box 1 (\b1 \u0003 105 dpm) were incubated with 12 \u0006g of uninfected\nor infected MeWo cell nuclear extract in a 10-\u0006l reaction mixture in binding\nbuffer A [40 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 \u0006g/ml\nbovine serum albumin, 12% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 3\n\u0006g poly(dI-dC)]. For the GC box 2/YY1 probes, 100 femtomoles of 40-bp labeled\nprobes containing wild-type and mutant GC box 2 sequences or wild-type and\nmutant YY1 binding sites (\b1 \u0003 105 dpm) were incubated with 12 \u0006g of MeWo\ncell nuclear extracts in a 10-\u0006l reaction mixture in binding buffer B [10 mM\nTris-HCl (pH 8.0), l mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 3 \u0006g poly(dI-dC), 0.1% NP-40,\n1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 \u0006g/ml bovine serum albumin]. The samples were\nanalyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacryl-\namide) gel and then autoradiography. 1n the supershift assays, anti-Sp family antibodies (antibodies against the four\nmembers of the Sp family [Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4]) obtained from Santa Cruz\nBiologicals (Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-Sp1 antibodies (Upstate, Temecula, CA)\nand rabbit polyclonal YY1 antiserum, generously supplied by Te-Chung Lee\n(University at Buffalo) were added in 4-\u0006g (Sp family) or 2-\u0006l (YY1) aliquots to\nreaction mixtures containing infected cell nuclear extracts and either GC box 1\nor YY1/GC box 2 probes. All of the antibodies directed against the Sp family\nmembers were described by the commercial suppliers as being positive in super-\nshift assays. This was con\ufb01rmed in control experiments using consensus GC\nbox-containing duplex probes (data not shown). The samples were then analyzed\nby electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel\nand autoradiography.\nRESULTS 1denti\ufb01cation of potential binding sites for cellular factors\nin the downstream region of VZV oriS. The 125 bp immedi-\nately downstream of the AT-rich palindrome of the VZV\noriS, located within the 1Rs region of the genome, were\nanalyzed for the presence of cellular transcription factor\nbinding sites using the AliBaba2.1 and Patch programs (http:\n//www.gene-regulation.com/pub/programs.html; Biobase). Two\nGC-rich sequences, designated GC box 1 and GC box 2, were\nidenti\ufb01ed 57 to 72 bp and 99 to 110 bp, respectively, 3\u0002 to the\n\ufb01nal TA pair in the minimal origin (Fig. 1B). Both contained\npredicted binding sites for the ubiquitous cellular transcription\nfactor Sp1. GC box 1 contains the canonical Sp1 binding\nsequence (5\u0002-GGGCGGG-3\u0002) \ufb01rst identi\ufb01ed by Dynan and\nTjian (14) in the SV40 early promoter. GC box 2 contains an\nalternative site (5\u0002-GGAGCGG-3\u0002) predicted to bind Sp1. Sp1\nis well documented to be involved in VZV replication based on\nstudies describing its role in several important VZV promot-\ners, including those regulating expression of VZV gI, gE, the\nVZV major single-strand binding protein, and the VZV DNA\npolymerase catalytic subunit (6, 19, 39, 43, 54). Sp1 has also\nbeen shown to interact physically and functionally with the\nVZV major transcriptional activator, 1E62 (36, 39). 1n addi-\ntion, there is a high incidence of predicted Sp1 binding sites\nwithin VZV promoters (a minimum of 18) beyond those al-\nready authenticated (44).\nA potential binding site (5\u0002-CAAATGGAG-3\u0002) for the cel-\nlular transcription factor YY1 was also identi\ufb01ed partially\noverlapping GC box 2. This sequence is highly homologous to\na YY1 site identi\ufb01ed in the HPV8 E6 promoter (5\u0002-CAAAT\nGGAC-3\u0002) and is also very similar to YY1 sites identi\ufb01ed in\nadeno-associated virus P5 promoter and the murine leukemia\nvirus long terminal repeat (26, 38). YY1 can act either as an\nactivator or a repressor and has been shown to be capable of\ninteracting with Sp1 (24, 45, 46). 1n contrast to Sp1, the role or\nroles that YY1 plays in VZV transcription and the viral life\ncycle are currently unknown. Based on the results from the\ncomputer analysis, EMSA, supershift, and mutational analyses\nwere then performed in order to determine whether GC box 1,\nGC box 2, and the YY1 site were bona \ufb01de binding targets for\nthe speci\ufb01c transcription factors.\nVOL. 82, 2008\nCELLULAR FACTORS AND VZV DNA REPLICATION\n11725\n\nSp1 and Sp3 bind to GC box 1. 1n the \ufb01rst series of exper-\niments, EMSAs were performed using a 30-bp duplex oligo-\nnucleotide containing the 15-bp GC box 1 and upstream and\ndownstream \ufb02anking sequences (Fig. 2A). Shift patterns were\nobtained using uninfected and VZV-infected MeWo cell nu-\nclear extracts. Two complexes, one major and one minor, were\nconsistently observed with both infected and uninfected nu-\nclear extracts, with the major complex being the slower migrat-\ning of the two (Fig. 2B). There was no difference in the shift\npattern, qualitatively or quantitatively, obtained with the two\nnuclear extracts, suggesting that viral proteins and/or cellular\nproteins whose expression or DNA binding properties were\nsigni\ufb01cantly modi\ufb01ed by VZV infection did not play a role in\nthe formation of the observed complexes. To test the speci\ufb01city\nof the formation of these two complexes, competition EMSA\nexperiments were performed using the unlabeled 30-bp GC\nbox 1 probe as the speci\ufb01c competitor and a 30-bp oligonucle-\notide containing the OBP box A sequence as the nonspeci\ufb01c\ncompetitor. As shown in Fig. 2C, the cold speci\ufb01c competitor\nef\ufb01ciently competed away the formation of the two complexes,\nwhile the presence of the nonspeci\ufb01c competitor had no effect\non the pattern of the shifted bands. 1n the next series of experiments, EMSAs were performed\nusing oligonucleotides containing mutations in the consensus\nSp1 binding site in the GC box 1 sequence. These included\ndeletion of the 7-base-pair Sp1 binding site and site-speci\ufb01c\nmutagenesis which substituted the \ufb01rst two G residues with T\nand C, respectively (Fig. 3A). Both of these mutations were\npredicted to abolish Sp1 binding using the same computer\nanalysis that had initially identi\ufb01ed the site. As shown in Fig.\n3B, both the deletion and substitution mutations ablated for-\nmation of both of the complexes formed with the wild-type\nsequence.\nAntibody supershift assays were then performed in order to\ncon\ufb01rm that Sp1 was, in fact, present in the observed com-\nplexes and to investigate whether any of the other three major\nmembers of the Sp family of transcription factors (Sp2, Sp3,\nand Sp4), all of which are capable of binding to GC-rich se-\nquences (17, 42), were also present. The results are presented\nin Fig. 3C and show that a signi\ufb01cant fraction of the major,\nslower-migrating complex was supershifted only in the pres-\nence of anti-Sp1 antibody. Two anti-Sp1-speci\ufb01c supershifted\ncomplexes were consistently observed in these experiments.\nOne migrated slightly more slowly than the major complex did,\nand the second, representing the majority of the supershifted\nmaterial, failed to enter the gel. The less-abundant faster-\nmigrating complex was completely supershifted only in the\npresence of anti-Sp3 antibody. 1n the data presented in Fig. 3C,\na small amount of material failed to enter the gel in the pres-\nence of anti-Sp4 antibody. This occurred in three of \ufb01ve sep-\narate EMSA experiments, whereas the shifts observed with the\nSp1 and Sp3 antibodies occurred in all \ufb01ve experiments. 1n\ncontrast, no supershifts or losses of complexes were observed\nin the presence of anti-Sp2 antibodies.

VIROL.\n\nused here as a negative control, also showed no effect on\ncomplex formation or migration. Thus, Sp1 is present in at\nleast one complex within the major supershifted band. Sp3\nappears to be present exclusively in the complex represented\nby the less-abundant, faster-migrating band. Sp4 may also be\nassociated with GC box 1 but to a much lower and less stable\nextent than Sp1 and Sp3 under these experimental conditions.\nYY1 binds to the predicted YY1 binding site. 1n the next\nseries of experiments, we wished to determine whether protein\ncomplexes were formed with duplex oligonucleotides contain-\ning GC box 2 sequence and the predicted overlapping YY1\nbinding site. EMSAs were performed using a 40-bp probe\ncontaining both sequences and 8-bp upstream and 15-bp down-\nstream \ufb02anking sequences (Fig. 4A). Shifts were performed\nwith both uninfected and infected MeWo cell extracts. Three\nmajor complexes were formed in the presence of both unin-\nfected and infected cell nuclear extracts and displayed identical\nmigration positions (Fig. 4B). A decrease in the level of the\nintermediate migrating complex with infected protein extracts\ncompared to uninfected protein extracts was frequently ob-\nserved in these experiments, suggesting that this complex is less\nstable in the case of the infected cell extracts.\nWe next wished to determine whether any of the Sp family\nmembers or YY1 bound to this sequence. Supershift experi-\nments with antibodies against Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 indicated\nthat, in contrast to our results with GC box 1, none of these\nfactors bound to the probe containing GC box 2 (data not\nshown). Supershifts with anti-YY1, however, consistently re-\nsulted in loss of the fastest-migrating band in the case of the\nwild-type sequence and with probes containing deletion and\nsubstitution mutations predicted to disrupt the binding of Sp1\n(Fig. 5). 1n each of these cases, signal was present in the well,\nFIG. 3.

Finally, site-speci\ufb01c mutation of the YY1 site led to loss of\nthe fastest-migrating band, and here, no signal was seen in the\nwell in the presence of anti-YY1 antibody.\nThus, our results show that YY1 binds to the predicted YY1\nbinding site, whereas there is no evidence either by supershift\nassays or by mutational analysis that any members of the Sp\nfamily bind to this portion of the downstream region of VZV\noriS. The site-speci\ufb01c and deletion mutations narrow the YY1\nsite to 5\u0002-CCAAATGG-3\u0002 and indicate that the two 3\u0002-termi-\nnal guanine residues are critical for YY1 binding. The persis-\ntence of the two slower-migrating bands suggests that their\nformation involves the \ufb02anking regions, rather than the core\nelements mutated. This was con\ufb01rmed in competition experi-\nments where the cold 40-bp probe successfully competed away\nall three complexes (data not shown).\nVZV infection lowers the level of Sp4 present in MeWo cells.\nWe next examined the levels of Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 and\nYY1 present in uninfected and infected whole-cell extracts by\nimmunoblotting.

VIROL.\n\nfor Sp1 and Sp3 resulted in an increase in origin-dependent\nDNA replication in DpnI resistance replication assays using a\nplasmid containing the HSV oriS. Analogous experiments\nwere performed in the work reported here in order to deter-\nmine the effects of mutation of the Sp1/Sp3 site in GC box 1\nand the downstream YY1 site. These experiments were per-\nformed by transfection of the pVO2 plasmid (48, 50) contain-\ning the VZV oriS sequence (OBP boxes C and A, the AT-rich\npalindrome, and the 125-bp downstream region) into MeWo\ncells followed by VZV superinfection at a ratio of 0.4/1 in-\nfected to uninfected cells. The cells were harvested 48 h after\nsuperinfection, and the state of the oriS-containing plasmid\nDNA was analyzed by DpnI digestion, followed by separation\non agarose gels and Southern blot hybridization. Blots were\nprobed with a 400-bp pVO2 fragment that allowed clear dif-\nferentiation between replicated (unmethylated, DpnI-resis-\ntant) progeny DNA and unreplicated (methylated DpnI-sensi-\ntive) input plasmids.\nControl DpnI replication assays using pVO2 containing the\nwild-type VZV oriS showed a clear and readily detectable\nsignal at the position predicted for the replicated DNA (Fig.\n7A). 1n contrast, assays performed under the same conditions\nusing the parent pAT153 plasmid lacking the VZV oriS re-\nsulted in no signal at the position of the replicated DNA. For\na second negative control, pVO2 containing a three-base sub-\nstitution in the box A OBP binding site was used. This also\nresulted in a loss of the replicated DNA band in agreement\nwith the results of Stow et al. (50) who showed via deletion that\nbox A is required for oriS-dependent DNA replication. 1ndi-\nvidual point mutations at the CGC positions were shown by\nChen and Olivo (8) to eliminate OBP binding. Thus, these data\ncon\ufb01rm the long-held supposition that OBP binding to box A\nis required for VZV oriS-dependent DNA replication even in\nthe presence of box C. 1n the next series of experiments, triplicate DpnI assays were\nperformed using wild-type pVO2 and pVO2 plasmids contain-\ning the site-speci\ufb01c mutations within GC box 1 and the YY1\nsite which ablated Sp1/Sp3 and YY1 binding, respectively. As\nshown in Fig. 7B and C, mutation of GC box 1 increased the\nlevel of origin-dependent replication two- to threefold, and this\ndifference was statistically signi\ufb01cant (P \t 0.035). 1n contrast,\nthe YY1 substitution mutation had no statistically signi\ufb01cant\neffect (P \t 0.162) on the ef\ufb01ciency of origin-dependent repli-\ncation under these conditions.

This replication origin desig-\nnated oriS, is present within the inverted repeat sequences\nsurrounding the unique short (US) region of the VZV genome.\nThe structure of the VZV oriS is distinctly different from that\nof the oriS of HSV-1. While both contain an AT-rich palin-\ndrome 45 to 46 bp in length, the arrangement of binding sites\nfor the HSV and VZV OBPs differs signi\ufb01cantly. Speci\ufb01cally,\nthe HSV oriS contains experimentally veri\ufb01ed OBP binding\nsites oriented in opposite directions upstream and downstream\nof the AT-rich region (12, 49, 52, 53). 1n contrast, the three\nexperimentally veri\ufb01ed OBP binding sites within the VZV oriS\nare all located upstream of the AT-rich palindrome (8, 50).\nFurthermore, Stow and Davison (48) showed that a plasmid\ncontaining only the proximal OBP binding site, the AT-rich\npalindrome, and 125 bp of sequence downstream from the\nAT-rich sequence were suf\ufb01cient for origin-dependent replica-\ntion in DpnI replication assays.\nOur results show that the cellular transcription factors Sp1\nand Sp3 and possibly Sp4 interact with a GC-rich site (GC box\n1) downstream of the AT-rich palindrome. This is true despite\nthe fact that all four Sp family members are expressed in\nMeWo cells. Two complexes reproducibly formed with GC box\n1 were identi\ufb01ed by EMSA analysis and antibody supershifts,\nwith one being speci\ufb01c for Sp1 and the other speci\ufb01c for Sp3.\nPartial deletion and site-speci\ufb01c mutation of the GC box 1\nabolished formation of both complexes, providing further\nproof of speci\ufb01c binding. No difference in complex formation\nwas observed using infected and uninfected cell extracts, sug-\ngesting that upon infection, no additional viral or cellular pro-\nteins were recruited to these complexes. Sp1 and Sp3 belong to\nthe growing family of Sp/XKLF cellular transcription factors of\nwhich Sp1 is the prototype. Some 23 members of this family\nhave been identi\ufb01ed in the human genome based on the pres-\nence of a combination of three conserved Cys2His2 zinc \ufb01ngers\nthat form a DNA recognition motif (7). However, only Sp1,\nSp2, Sp3, and Sp4 have been extensively characterized as to\ntheir tissue speci\ufb01city and role(s) in transcription (7, 28, 42).\nSp1 through Sp4 all show a modular structure with activation\nand, in some cases inhibitory, domains present in their N-\nterminal regions and the characteristic set of zinc \ufb01ngers\npresent near their C termini. This similar modular structure\nhas resulted in their being designated a subgroup of the larger\nSp/XKLF family (7). Sp1 and Sp3 are believed to be ubiqui-\ntously expressed in all tissues, and both are capable of activat-\ning expression of mammalian genes via recognition of GC- and\nGT-rich motifs (28, 42). However, the interplay between Sp1\nand Sp3 is complex, with Sp3 sometimes acting as a repressor\nof Sp1 (28, 30). Sp2 lacks one of the N-terminal activation\ndomains and binds to a site different from that of Sp1, Sp3, and\nSp4 (33, 42). Sp2 is generally associated with repression of\ngenes activated by the other three members of the major Sp\nsubfamily. Expression of Sp4 has been detected in several cell\nlines (17, 23). However, in mammals, Sp4 is predominantly\nexpressed in tissues of neuronal origin, while the expression\nand activity of Sp1 in those tissues are downregulated (27,\n31, 57).\nSp1/Sp3 sites have been identi\ufb01ed in the replication origins\nof several DNA viruses, including HPV, SV40, EBV, and\nHSV-1 (5, 13, 15, 16, 24, 25, 37). The presence of the Sp1/Sp3\nsites has been associated with an enhancement of origin-de-\npendent DNA replication. Deletion or mutation of consensus\nGC boxes within the HPV and SV40 genomes resulted in\ndecreases in DNA replication ef\ufb01ciency. The mechanism of\nhow Sp1 enhances replication in these cases is unknown. How-\never, at least for the case of SV40, the Sp1 site in question does\nnot appear to be involved in transcription of the viral genome\n(13, 16). Sp1 and possibly other Sp family members also in\ufb02u-\nence origin-dependent EBV DNA replication at the cis-acting\nelement oriLyt (5, 15). This element consists of two essential\ndomains designated the upstream and downstream compo-\nnents. The upstream component contains DNA binding motifs\nfor the EBV transcriptional activator BZLF1. The downstream\ncomponent is known to be the binding site of cellular tran-\nscription factors ZBP-89 and Sp1, which stimulate DNA rep-\nlication. This stimulation is believed to result from the recruit-\nment of viral DNA replication proteins, since direct interaction\nof Sp1 and ZBP-89 with the viral DNA polymerase and its\nprocessivity factor was demonstrated in protein binding assays\n(5). The HSV-1 genome contains two oriS core-adjacent reg-\nulatory (Oscar) elements, OscarL and OscarR, at the base of\nthe oriS palindrome. Mutation of either element reduced oriS-\ndependent DNA replication by 60 to 70%, and disruption of\nboth elements reduced replication by 90%. OscarL contains a\nconsensus binding site for the transcription factor Sp1. EMSA\nand supershift experiments using antibodies directed against\nthe Sp family members of transcription factors demonstrated\nthe presence of Sp1 and Sp3, but not Sp2 or Sp4, in the\nprotein-DNA complexes formed at OscarL (37). 1n contrast to our results with GC box 1, we found no\nevidence of interaction of any of the Sp family members with\nthe second GC-rich sequence (GC box 2), which was also\nthought to be a possible Sp1 binding site. 1nstead, the cellular\nfactor YY1 was found to bind to a predicted site overlapping\nGC box 2. These results represents the \ufb01rst experimentally\nveri\ufb01ed occurrence of YY1 binding to a VZV DNA sequence.\nYY1 is a 414-amino-acid zinc \ufb01nger protein that is capable of\nboth repression and activation of cellular genes and transcrip-\ntion in several virus systems, including adeno-associated virus,\nHPV, parvovirus B19, HSV-1, and murine leukemia virus (26,\n46). YY1 has been shown to repress HPV ori-dependent DNA\nreplication in a cell-free replication system. This repression,\nhowever, does not require the presence of a YY1 consensus\nbinding site or interaction of YY1 with HPV DNA. Rather, the\nYY1-mediated repression of HPV DNA replication is believed\nto be due to direct interaction between YY1 and the HPV E2\nprotein, a transcription factor that plays important roles in the\nassembly of the initiation complex at the HPV origin (25).\nOur results from DpnI replication assays show that a point\nmutation of GC box 1 that ablated the formation of the two\ncomplexes observed in EMSAs also resulted in a two- to three-\nfold increase in replication ef\ufb01ciency compared to that ob-\nserved with the wild-type virus. These \ufb01ndings concerning the\n11730\nKHALIL ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nfunction of the Sp1/Sp3 binding site within the VZV oriS\nindicate that interaction of Sp1 and Sp3 with the wild-type GC\nbox 1 sequence results in a suppression of origin-dependent\nreplication. This is in direct contrast to the function of such\nsites in the EBV and HSV-1 origins and represents a novel\n\ufb01nding for VZV. These results also represent the \ufb01rst docu-\nmentation of a role for Sp3 in the VZV replication cycle. Since\nthese data were obtained using a plasmid containing only\nthe VZV oriS, it will, in the future, be important to correlate these\n\ufb01ndings with the infectious phenotype of viruses carrying the GC\nbox 1 mutation at the native sites within the VZV genome.\nThe role or roles played by YY1 in VZV infection are\nunknown; thus, the identi\ufb01cation of a bona \ufb01de YY1 binding\nsite within the oriS downstream region site afforded the po-\ntential to identify a VZV-speci\ufb01c function for this ubiquitous\ncellular factor. YY1 has been shown to be capable of direct\ninteraction with Sp1 (24, 45), raising the possibility that bridg-\ning could occur between Sp1 and YY1 bound at their respec-\ntive sites in the downstream region of the VZV oriS. Mutation\nof the YY1 site with concomitant loss of YY1 binding, how-\never, resulted in no statistically signi\ufb01cant effect, eliminating\nthe possibility that a potential Sp1/YY1 bridging interaction\nmight in\ufb02uence replication ef\ufb01ciency under our experimental\nconditions. This does not eliminate the possibility that YY1\nplays an important role in VZV infection. YY1 could in\ufb02uence\ncellular functions vital for VZV lytic replication or interact\nfunctionally with 1E62 or other VZV transactivators, such as\nthe 1E4 and ORF61 proteins (18, 34, 35) at speci\ufb01c viral pro-\nmoters. Alternatively, YY1 could in\ufb02uence origin-dependent\nDNA replication in primary cells or in speci\ufb01c tissues infected\nby VZV in the human host. As an example, YY1 has been\nshown to act as a negative regulator of the EBV BRLF1 pro-\nmoter in both HeLa and Raji cells, but the level of suppression\nwas much greater in HeLa cells (56).\nThe data gathered on the ability of Sp1 and Sp3 to bind to\nthe GC box 1 site in the downstream region of oriS and the\nincreased oriS-dependent replication ef\ufb01ciency observed with\nmutations that ablate that binding led to the following model\nfor the role of the GC box 1 sequence analyzed during the\ncourse of this work (Fig. 8). At times immediately after infec-\ntion, endogenous Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the GC box 1 site. Once\nsuf\ufb01cient 1E62 is synthesized, the most active phase of viral\ngene expression ensues, and at this stage Sp1 and Sp3 exchange\noff this site and interact physically and functionally with the\nmajor VZV transactivator 1E62 to ef\ufb01ciently express the viral\ngenome. Previous work by Peng et al. (39) showed that as\nmuch as 20 to 25% of total Sp1 is associated with 1E62 in\nVZV-infected cells. Additional support for this possibility\ncomes from experiments showing that ectopic expression of\nSp1 and Sp3 but not YY1 enhance 1E62-mediated transacti-\nvation in transient-transfection assays (data not shown). The\nresulting decrease of Sp1 and Sp3 at GC box 1 would, based on\nour data, allow an increase in origin-dependent DNA replica-\ntion. During the late phase of the VZV life cycle, 1E62 is\nexcluded, to a large extent, from the nucleus (21, 22), and Sp1\nand Sp3 could potentially rebind to this site and aid in decreas-\ning DNA replication during this phase of infection.\nThis model has broader implications in terms of the multi-\nfaceted nature of VZV pathogenesis. Our data show that in\nMeWo cells, VZV infection reduces expression of the Sp4\nprotein to a modest but reproducible extent and that interac-\ntion of Sp4 with the GC box 1 element is less stable than that\nobserved with Sp1 and Sp3. As indicated above, Sp4 is primar-\nily and dominantly expressed in neuronal tissue and is capable\nof binding to the consensus Sp1 site, whereas Sp1 expression is\ndownregulated. Therefore, it is possible that, under certain\nconditions, Sp4 may be able to compete with and displace Sp1\nat the VZV GC box 1 site as has been reported in the case of\nFIG. 8. Model summarizing a possible mechanism of Sp1/Sp3-dependent modulation of VZV DNA origin-dependent replication during the\nVZV life cycle. 1n this model, Sp1 and Sp3 cycle on and off the consensus GGGCGGG site within GC box 1 in response to requirements for their\npresence for 1E62-mediated transcription at promoter sites within the VZV genome. Thus, their presence during the early phase of the virus life\ncycle would be minimal, resulting in increased DNA replication which also peaks at this phase. 1E, immediate early.\nVOL. 82, 2008\nCELLULAR FACTORS AND VZV DNA REPLICATION\n11731\n\nthe human ADH5/FDH promoter (23). 1f Sp4, like Sp1 en-\nhances 1E62-mediated transactivation, the combination of nor-\nmally decreased expression of Sp1 in neurons and reduction of\nSp4 levels due to infection could lead to a reduction of VZV\ngene expression upon initial neuronal infection and a general\ncessation of viral replication. Alternatively, if Sp4 does not\nsynergize with 1E62 but binds to the GC box 1 element, it\ncould, even at reduced levels and possibly in conjunction with\nneuronal factors, act to suppress VZV DNA replication. Both\nof these scenarios would likely increase the chances for a\nswitch from lytic to latent infection. Conversely, low levels of\nSp1 and decreased levels of Sp4 during reactivation could lead\nto increased ef\ufb01ciency of viral DNA replication. Thus, the\ncis-acting GC box 1 element within the downstream region of\nVZV oriS and the interplay of various levels of Sp1 and Sp4\ncould potentially be involved in the establishment and/or re-\nactivation of VZV latency.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by NIH grants AI18449 and AI36884.\nM.I.K. was supported in part by a scholarship from the Egyptian\nMinistry of Higher Education.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Ruyechan*\nDepartment of Microbiology and Immunology and Witebsky Center for Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology,\nUniversity at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, New York 14214\nReceived 24 June 2008/Accepted 18 September 2008\nThe varicella-zoster virus (VZV) origin of DNA replication (oriS) contains a 46-bp AT-rich palindrome and\nthree consensus binding sites for the VZV origin binding protein (OBP) encoded by VZV ORF51. All three OBP\nbinding sites are upstream of the palindrome in contrast to the sequence of the herpes simplex virus oriS,\nwhich has required OBP binding sites upstream and downstream of the AT-rich region. We are investigating\nthe roles that sequences downstream of the palindrome play in VZV oriS-dependent DNA replication. Com-\nputer analysis identi\ufb01ed two GC boxes, GC box 1 and GC box 2, in the downstream region which were predicted\nto be binding sites for the cellular transcription factor Sp1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift\nassays showed that two members of the Sp family (Sp1 and Sp3) stably bind to GC box 1, but not to GC box\n2. A predicted binding site for the cellular factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) that overlaps with GC box 2 was also\nidenti\ufb01ed. Supershift and mutational analyses con\ufb01rmed the binding of YY1 to this site. Mutation of GC box\n1 resulted in loss of Sp1 and Sp3 binding and an increase in origin-dependent replication ef\ufb01ciency in DpnI\nreplication assays. In contrast, mutation of the YY1 site had a statistically insigni\ufb01cant effect. These results\nsuggest a model where origin-dependent DNA replication and viral transcription are coupled by the binding\nof Sp1 and Sp3 to the downstream region of the VZV replication origin during lytic infection. They may also\nhave implications regarding establishment or reactivation of viral latency.\nVaricella-zoster virus (VZV) is a member of the Alphaher-\npesvirus subfamily of the Herpesviridae family. VZV is the caus-\native agent of two types of disease, chicken pox (varicella)\nupon primary infection and shingles (zoster) after reactivation\nfrom latency (1, 2). The VZV genome consists of 125 kbp\nwhich encodes approximately 69 open reading frames (ORFs).\nThe viral genome is made up of long and short unique seg-\nments designated UL and US, respectively, both of which are\nbounded by inverted repeat sequences (11). The linear se-\nquence of VZV genes is similar to that of herpes simplex virus\ntype 1 (HSV-1) and includes the coding sequences for ortho-\nlogues of the seven HSV-1 proteins required for origin-depen-\ndent DNA replication (9).\nThe VZV genome contains two origins of DNA replication\n(oriS) within the internal repeats (IRs) and terminal repeats\n(TRs) bounding the US segment at sites analogous to those\nwithin the HSV-1 genome. VZV, however, lacks the third\nHSV-1 origin (oriL), which is located near the center of the\nHSV-1 UL region (10, 11, 48, 49). HSV-1 oriL has been shown\nto be dispensable for replication of HSV DNA (3, 53) but has\nbeen implicated in HSV pathogenesis and reactivation from\nlatency (4). The equivalent region in the VZV genome is\ncomprised of a bidirectional promoter that regulates the tran-\nscription of the VZV DNA polymerase catalytic subunit\n(ORF28) and DNA binding protein (ORF29) genes (32, 54).\nThe architecture of the VZV and HSV-1 oriS regions differs\nsigni\ufb01cantly (Fig. 1). The two VZV oriS regions contain an\nAT-rich palindrome and three consensus 10-bp binding sites\n[5\u0002-C(G/A)TTCGCACT-3\u0002] for the VZV origin binding pro-\ntein (OBP) encoded by VZV ORF51 located upstream of the\nAT-rich palindrome (48, 50). These binding sites, designated\nboxes A, B, and C are identical or nearly identical to the\nconsensus site for the HSV-1 UL9 OBP with which the VZV\nORF51 OBP shares 54.8% similarity and 46.5% identity (8,\n50). All three OBP binding sites in the VZV origin are ori-\nented in the same direction and are present on the same strand\nof the viral DNA. Origin-dependent DNA replication in VZV\nrequires the AT-rich region and box A. Box C is not essential,\nbut its presence increases replication ef\ufb01ciency, while box B\nappears to be completely dispensable (48, 50). Nothing is cur-\nrently known regarding the role played by sequences down-\nstream of the VZV minimal origin in viral DNA replication. A\npartial (7 of 10 bp) OBP binding site is present downstream of\nthe AT-rich palindrome with the same orientation and on the\nsame strand as the upstream OBP boxes. However, gel shift\nand DNase I protection assays failed to demonstrate VZV\nOBP binding to this sequence (8, 50). In contrast, in the HSV-1\noriS, binding sites for the UL9 OBP (boxes I, II, and III) occur\nboth upstream and downstream of the AT-rich region. Boxes I\nand II are located upstream and downstream on opposite\nstrands of the DNA and are oriented in opposite directions.\nBox III is located upstream of box I but is oriented in the same\ndirection and occurs on the same DNA strand as box II. Mu-\ntational analysis has shown that the minimal HSV-1 requires\nthe presence of both box I and box II and the central AT-rich\nregion (4, 12, 49, 52).\nThe structural differences between the VZV and HSV-1 oriS\nin terms of the positioning and orientation of the OBP binding\nsites suggest that the mechanism and/or transacting factors\n* Corresponding author.

One possi-\nbility raised by Stow et al. (50) is that cellular factors or as yet\nunidenti\ufb01ed viral proteins could bind downstream of the AT-\nrich region in the VZV oriS to facilitate unwinding of the\norigin and assembly of the viral DNA replication machinery.\nThere is precedence for this possibility based on work with\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV), HSV-1, simian virus 40 (SV40), and\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV). The cellular transcription factor\nSp1 binds to the downstream region of EBV ORILyt and phys-\nically interacts with the EBV DNA polymerase catalytic and\naccessory subunits, increasing their recruitment and resulting\nin a positive effect on DNA replication (5, 15). Sp1 and the\nrelated factor Sp3 bind to the upstream region of the HSV-1\noriS at a cis element, designated OscarL, and also have a\npositive effect on origin-dependent DNA replication, although\nthe speci\ufb01c mechanism remains unknown (37). Several tran-\nscription factors were found to stimulate SV40 DNA replica-\ntion, including NF1, AP1, and Sp1 (16). Sp1 has also been\nreported (13) to enhance replication of human papillomavirus\ntype 18 (HPV18). In contrast, the transcription factor Yin\nYang 1 (YY1) has been shown to suppress HPV DNA repli-\ncation through interference with the function of the HPV E2\nprotein (25).\nIn the work presented here, we identi\ufb01ed and authenticated\nthe presence of binding sites for cellular transcription factors\nwithin the downstream region of the VZV oriS and tested the\neffects of mutations of those sequences on VZV origin-depen-\ndent replication. Our data show that the cellular factors Sp1,\nSp3, and YY1 stably bind to different portions of the down-\nstream region of the VZV oriS. YY1 appears to have no effect\non origin-dependent replication. However, mutation of the\nSp1/Sp3 site that ablates binding of these factors resulted in an\nincrease in replication in in situ DpnI replication assays. This\nindicates that Sp1 and Sp3 act to suppress VZV oriS-depen-\ndent replication in contrast to what has been observed, as\ndescribed above, in other virus systems. Further, this repre-\nsents the \ufb01rst documentation of a role for Sp3 in VZV infec-\ntion.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCells and viruses. MeWo cells, a human melanoma cell line that supports the\nreplication of VZV, were grown in Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium supple-\nmented with 10% fetal bovine serum as previously described (47). VZV strain\nMSP was propagated in MeWo cell monolayers as described by Lynch et al. (29)\nand Peng et al. (39).\nNuclear and whole-cell lysates. Nuclear extracts of VZV-infected and unin-\nfected MeWo cells were prepared as previously described (29). Brie\ufb02y, pelleted\ncells were washed once with 30 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. Packed\ncells were resuspended in one packed cell volume of buffer A (10 mM HEPES\n[pH 7.9], 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) at 4\u00b0C and allowed\nto swell on ice for 15 min. Cells were then lysed by 10 rapid passages through a\n25-gauge hypodermic syringe, and the homogenate was sedimented brie\ufb02y at\n12,000 \u0003 g. The crude nuclear pellet was resuspended in two-thirds of one\npacked cell volume (determined at the time of cell harvest) of buffer C (20 mM\nHEPES [pH 7.9], 25% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM\nEDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \ufb02uoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol), and the\nresulting solution was incubated on ice with stirring for 30 min. The nuclear\ndebris was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 \u0003 g, and the supernatant\n(nuclear extract) was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 20%\n[vol/vol] glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl\n\ufb02uoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) for 2 h. The dialyzed extract was then quick-\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u000470\u00b0C. Whole-cell lysates of VZV-\ninfected and uninfected MeWo cells were prepared as previously described (39).\nCells were grown to con\ufb02uence in 100-mm petri dishes, washed with phosphate-\nbuffered saline buffer, and then suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH\n7.5], 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor\ncocktail [Roche, Mamheim, Germany] added per the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntion). The lysates were collected and centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatants\nwere stored at \u000470\u00b0C for subsequent use.\nImmunoblot analyses. Whole-cell lysates of VZV-infected and uninfected\nMeWo cells were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-10% polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis and immunoblotting for the presence of Sp family members and\nYY1 as described by Yang et al. (55). Antibodies against Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Sp4, and\n\u0005-tubulin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).\nAntibody against Sp1 was also obtained from Upstate (Temecula, CA). Rabbit\npolyclonal antibody against YY1 was generously supplied by Te-Chung Lee\n(University at Buffalo). Reactive bands were visualized using goat anti-rabbit\nFIG. 1.

Sta-\ntistical signi\ufb01cance was determined by a one-way analysis of variance, followed by\nTukey\u2019s post hoc test.\nPlasmids. The pVO2 plasmid containing a 259-bp fragment encompassing\nnucleotides 5502 to 5760 of the TRs/IRs sequence of the VZV Dumas strain (10)\nwas generously supplied by Nigel Stow (MRC Virology Unit, Institute of Virol-\nogy, University of Glasgow). This fragment contains the VZV oriS region in-\ncluding OBP boxes C and A, the AT-rich palindrome, and 125 bp of downstream\nsequence. The pVO2 parental plasmid, pAT153, was purchased from MoBiTec\n(Goettingen, Germany).\nPlasmids containing GC box 1 and YY1 and box A substitution mutations\nwithin the oriS region were generated by mutation of pVO2 using the\nQuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the\nfollowing primer sets: primers 5\u0002-ATGTCGCGGTTTTATGGGGTGTTCGCG\nGGCTTTTCACAGAATATA-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-TATATTCTGTGAAAAGCCCGCG\nAACACCCCATAAAACCGCGACAT-3\u0002 for GC box 1, primers 5\u0002-ACAGAA\nTATATATATTCCAAATTTAGCGGCAGGCTTTTTAAAATC-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-G\nATTTTAAAAAGCCTGCCGCTAAATTTGGAATATATATATTCTGT-3\u0002\nfor YY1, and primers 5\u0002-GGCATGTGTCCAACCACCGTTAAAACTTTCTT\nTCTATATATATAT-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-ATATATATATAGAAAGAAAGTTTTAACG\nGTGGTTGGACACATGCC-3\u0002 for box A. All primers were synthesized by IDT\n(Coralville, IA). The positions and sequences of the mutations in the VZV oriS\nsequence contained within the pVO2 plasmid used in transfections were veri\ufb01ed\nby sequencing at the Roswell Park sequencing facility.\nDpnI replication assays. MeWo cells were transfected with Lipofectamine\nreagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nFour microliters of Lipofectamine reagent was used per microgram of trans-\nfected DNA in each transfection. In transfections performed in 100-mm-diam-\neter petri dishes, 2.1 \u0003 106 MeWo cells per dish were seeded in 12 ml of\ncomplete growth medium. The cells were 80% con\ufb02uent at the time of transfec-\ntion. Three hours before transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh\nmedium. Replication experiments were performed as described by Stow and\nMcMonagle (49) and Stow and Davison (48). The cells were transfected with 5\n\u0006g of wild-type or mutant pVO2 plasmids. At 6 h posttransfection, cells were\nsuperinfected with VZV strain MSP. VZV superinfections were performed by\nadding a ratio of 0.4 infected cell per 1 uninfected cell of the infected cells to\neach monolayer. Total cellular DNA was prepared 48 h after superinfection by\nthe addition of 5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 0.5%\nsodium dodecyl sulfate, 20 \u0006g/ml RNase I) per dish. Lysates were transferred to\n15-ml conical test tubes and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Proteinase K in TE buffer\n(10 mM Tris-HCl and 0.001 M EDTA) was added to a \ufb01nal concentration of 100\n\u0006g per ml, and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 0.15 M. The mixture was\nthen incubated at 50\u00b0C for 3 h. The DNA was isolated by phenol chloroform\nextraction, followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was digested with DpnI\nand EcoRI as described by Stow and Davison (48) and analyzed by Southern blot\nhybridization. Transfers were done using TurboBlotter kits obtained from What-\nman, Inc. (Sanford, ME). The blots were probed with a 400-bp PCR product\nprepared from pVO2 using primers 5\u0002-GTGCTCCTGTCGTTGAGGACCCG\nG-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-CCTCTGACTTGAGCGTCGATTTTT-3\u0002 and end labeled with[\u0007-\n32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This fragment includes a\nportion (nucleotide positions 1465 to 1864) of the pVO2 plasmid containing the\nColE1 origin of replication and was designed to detect both intact DpnI-resistant\nlinearized pVO2 (3.9 kb) resulting from replication of the input plasmid and an\n872-bp fragment resulting from the DpnI-sensitive unreplicated input plasmid.\nThe resulting bands were quanti\ufb01ed by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics,\nSumyvale, CA) analysis. The ratio of replicated plasmid to input plasmid rep-\nresented the replication ef\ufb01ciency of the test plasmid. The data from represen-\ntative experiments are presented as means of triplicate DpnI replications. Error\nbars indicate standard errors. Statistical signi\ufb01cance was determined by a one-\nway analysis of variance followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test.\nEMSA and supershift analyses. Thirty-base-pair oligonucleotide probes (IDT,\nCoralville, IA) containing wild-type and mutant GC box 1 elements and 40-bp\nprobes containing wild-type and mutant YY1 and GC box 2 binding site elements\nwere used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Probes were end\nlabeled with [\u0007-32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For the GC\nbox 1 probes, 100 femtomoles of the 30-bp labeled probes containing wild-type\nand mutant GC box 1 (\b1 \u0003 105 dpm) were incubated with 12 \u0006g of uninfected\nor infected MeWo cell nuclear extract in a 10-\u0006l reaction mixture in binding\nbuffer A [40 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 \u0006g/ml\nbovine serum albumin, 12% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 3\n\u0006g poly(dI-dC)]. For the GC box 2/YY1 probes, 100 femtomoles of 40-bp labeled\nprobes containing wild-type and mutant GC box 2 sequences or wild-type and\nmutant YY1 binding sites (\b1 \u0003 105 dpm) were incubated with 12 \u0006g of MeWo\ncell nuclear extracts in a 10-\u0006l reaction mixture in binding buffer B [10 mM\nTris-HCl (pH 8.0), l mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 3 \u0006g poly(dI-dC), 0.1% NP-40,\n1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 \u0006g/ml bovine serum albumin]. The samples were\nanalyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacryl-\namide) gel and then autoradiography.\nIn the supershift assays, anti-Sp family antibodies (antibodies against the four\nmembers of the Sp family [Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4]) obtained from Santa Cruz\nBiologicals (Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-Sp1 antibodies (Upstate, Temecula, CA)\nand rabbit polyclonal YY1 antiserum, generously supplied by Te-Chung Lee\n(University at Buffalo) were added in 4-\u0006g (Sp family) or 2-\u0006l (YY1) aliquots to\nreaction mixtures containing infected cell nuclear extracts and either GC box 1\nor YY1/GC box 2 probes. All of the antibodies directed against the Sp family\nmembers were described by the commercial suppliers as being positive in super-\nshift assays. This was con\ufb01rmed in control experiments using consensus GC\nbox-containing duplex probes (data not shown). The samples were then analyzed\nby electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel\nand autoradiography.\nRESULTS\nIdenti\ufb01cation of potential binding sites for cellular factors\nin the downstream region of VZV oriS. The 125 bp immedi-\nately downstream of the AT-rich palindrome of the VZV\noriS, located within the IRs region of the genome, were\nanalyzed for the presence of cellular transcription factor\nbinding sites using the AliBaba2.1 and Patch programs (http:\n//www.gene-regulation.com/pub/programs.html; Biobase). Two\nGC-rich sequences, designated GC box 1 and GC box 2, were\nidenti\ufb01ed 57 to 72 bp and 99 to 110 bp, respectively, 3\u0002 to the\n\ufb01nal TA pair in the minimal origin (Fig. 1B). Both contained\npredicted binding sites for the ubiquitous cellular transcription\nfactor Sp1. GC box 1 contains the canonical Sp1 binding\nsequence (5\u0002-GGGCGGG-3\u0002) \ufb01rst identi\ufb01ed by Dynan and\nTjian (14) in the SV40 early promoter. GC box 2 contains an\nalternative site (5\u0002-GGAGCGG-3\u0002) predicted to bind Sp1. Sp1\nis well documented to be involved in VZV replication based on\nstudies describing its role in several important VZV promot-\ners, including those regulating expression of VZV gI, gE, the\nVZV major single-strand binding protein, and the VZV DNA\npolymerase catalytic subunit (6, 19, 39, 43, 54). Sp1 has also\nbeen shown to interact physically and functionally with the\nVZV major transcriptional activator, IE62 (36, 39). In addi-\ntion, there is a high incidence of predicted Sp1 binding sites\nwithin VZV promoters (a minimum of 18) beyond those al-\nready authenticated (44).\nA potential binding site (5\u0002-CAAATGGAG-3\u0002) for the cel-\nlular transcription factor YY1 was also identi\ufb01ed partially\noverlapping GC box 2. This sequence is highly homologous to\na YY1 site identi\ufb01ed in the HPV8 E6 promoter (5\u0002-CAAAT\nGGAC-3\u0002) and is also very similar to YY1 sites identi\ufb01ed in\nadeno-associated virus P5 promoter and the murine leukemia\nvirus long terminal repeat (26, 38). YY1 can act either as an\nactivator or a repressor and has been shown to be capable of\ninteracting with Sp1 (24, 45, 46). In contrast to Sp1, the role or\nroles that YY1 plays in VZV transcription and the viral life\ncycle are currently unknown. Based on the results from the\ncomputer analysis, EMSA, supershift, and mutational analyses\nwere then performed in order to determine whether GC box 1,\nGC box 2, and the YY1 site were bona \ufb01de binding targets for\nthe speci\ufb01c transcription factors.\nVOL. 82, 2008\nCELLULAR FACTORS AND VZV DNA REPLICATION\n11725\n\nSp1 and Sp3 bind to GC box 1. In the \ufb01rst series of exper-\niments, EMSAs were performed using a 30-bp duplex oligo-\nnucleotide containing the 15-bp GC box 1 and upstream and\ndownstream \ufb02anking sequences (Fig. 2A). Shift patterns were\nobtained using uninfected and VZV-infected MeWo cell nu-\nclear extracts. Two complexes, one major and one minor, were\nconsistently observed with both infected and uninfected nu-\nclear extracts, with the major complex being the slower migrat-\ning of the two (Fig. 2B). There was no difference in the shift\npattern, qualitatively or quantitatively, obtained with the two\nnuclear extracts, suggesting that viral proteins and/or cellular\nproteins whose expression or DNA binding properties were\nsigni\ufb01cantly modi\ufb01ed by VZV infection did not play a role in\nthe formation of the observed complexes. To test the speci\ufb01city\nof the formation of these two complexes, competition EMSA\nexperiments were performed using the unlabeled 30-bp GC\nbox 1 probe as the speci\ufb01c competitor and a 30-bp oligonucle-\notide containing the OBP box A sequence as the nonspeci\ufb01c\ncompetitor. As shown in Fig. 2C, the cold speci\ufb01c competitor\nef\ufb01ciently competed away the formation of the two complexes,\nwhile the presence of the nonspeci\ufb01c competitor had no effect\non the pattern of the shifted bands.\nIn the next series of experiments, EMSAs were performed\nusing oligonucleotides containing mutations in the consensus\nSp1 binding site in the GC box 1 sequence. These included\ndeletion of the 7-base-pair Sp1 binding site and site-speci\ufb01c\nmutagenesis which substituted the \ufb01rst two G residues with T\nand C, respectively (Fig. 3A). Both of these mutations were\npredicted to abolish Sp1 binding using the same computer\nanalysis that had initially identi\ufb01ed the site. As shown in Fig.\n3B, both the deletion and substitution mutations ablated for-\nmation of both of the complexes formed with the wild-type\nsequence.\nAntibody supershift assays were then performed in order to\ncon\ufb01rm that Sp1 was, in fact, present in the observed com-\nplexes and to investigate whether any of the other three major\nmembers of the Sp family of transcription factors (Sp2, Sp3,\nand Sp4), all of which are capable of binding to GC-rich se-\nquences (17, 42), were also present. The results are presented\nin Fig. 3C and show that a signi\ufb01cant fraction of the major,\nslower-migrating complex was supershifted only in the pres-\nence of anti-Sp1 antibody. Two anti-Sp1-speci\ufb01c supershifted\ncomplexes were consistently observed in these experiments.\nOne migrated slightly more slowly than the major complex did,\nand the second, representing the majority of the supershifted\nmaterial, failed to enter the gel. The less-abundant faster-\nmigrating complex was completely supershifted only in the\npresence of anti-Sp3 antibody. In the data presented in Fig. 3C,\na small amount of material failed to enter the gel in the pres-\nence of anti-Sp4 antibody. This occurred in three of \ufb01ve sep-\narate EMSA experiments, whereas the shifts observed with the\nSp1 and Sp3 antibodies occurred in all \ufb01ve experiments. In\ncontrast, no supershifts or losses of complexes were observed\nin the presence of anti-Sp2 antibodies. Anti-YY1 antibody,\nFIG. 2.

VIROL.\n\nused here as a negative control, also showed no effect on\ncomplex formation or migration. Thus, Sp1 is present in at\nleast one complex within the major supershifted band. Sp3\nappears to be present exclusively in the complex represented\nby the less-abundant, faster-migrating band. Sp4 may also be\nassociated with GC box 1 but to a much lower and less stable\nextent than Sp1 and Sp3 under these experimental conditions.\nYY1 binds to the predicted YY1 binding site. In the next\nseries of experiments, we wished to determine whether protein\ncomplexes were formed with duplex oligonucleotides contain-\ning GC box 2 sequence and the predicted overlapping YY1\nbinding site. EMSAs were performed using a 40-bp probe\ncontaining both sequences and 8-bp upstream and 15-bp down-\nstream \ufb02anking sequences (Fig. 4A). Shifts were performed\nwith both uninfected and infected MeWo cell extracts. Three\nmajor complexes were formed in the presence of both unin-\nfected and infected cell nuclear extracts and displayed identical\nmigration positions (Fig. 4B). A decrease in the level of the\nintermediate migrating complex with infected protein extracts\ncompared to uninfected protein extracts was frequently ob-\nserved in these experiments, suggesting that this complex is less\nstable in the case of the infected cell extracts.\nWe next wished to determine whether any of the Sp family\nmembers or YY1 bound to this sequence. Supershift experi-\nments with antibodies against Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 indicated\nthat, in contrast to our results with GC box 1, none of these\nfactors bound to the probe containing GC box 2 (data not\nshown). Supershifts with anti-YY1, however, consistently re-\nsulted in loss of the fastest-migrating band in the case of the\nwild-type sequence and with probes containing deletion and\nsubstitution mutations predicted to disrupt the binding of Sp1\n(Fig. 5). In each of these cases, signal was present in the well,\nFIG. 3. EMSA and supershift assays using wild-type, GC box 1 deletion, and substitution mutant duplex oligonucleotides.

Finally, site-speci\ufb01c mutation of the YY1 site led to loss of\nthe fastest-migrating band, and here, no signal was seen in the\nwell in the presence of anti-YY1 antibody.\nThus, our results show that YY1 binds to the predicted YY1\nbinding site, whereas there is no evidence either by supershift\nassays or by mutational analysis that any members of the Sp\nfamily bind to this portion of the downstream region of VZV\noriS. The site-speci\ufb01c and deletion mutations narrow the YY1\nsite to 5\u0002-CCAAATGG-3\u0002 and indicate that the two 3\u0002-termi-\nnal guanine residues are critical for YY1 binding. The persis-\ntence of the two slower-migrating bands suggests that their\nformation involves the \ufb02anking regions, rather than the core\nelements mutated. This was con\ufb01rmed in competition experi-\nments where the cold 40-bp probe successfully competed away\nall three complexes (data not shown).\nVZV infection lowers the level of Sp4 present in MeWo cells.\nWe next examined the levels of Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 and\nYY1 present in uninfected and infected whole-cell extracts by\nimmunoblotting. Our results (Fig. 6) show that all four Sp\nfamily members and YY1 are expressed in MeWo cells. Quan-\nti\ufb01cation of the relative amounts of these factors using three\nsets of paired uninfected and infected cell extract preparations\nshowed that there was no statistically signi\ufb01cant difference in\nthe levels of Sp1 (P \t 0.373), Sp2 (P \t 0.254), Sp3 (P \t 0.563),\nand YY1 (P \t 0.373) in infected versus uninfected MeWo cell\nextracts. Also, infection did not alter the levels of the two\nshorter forms of Sp3 of very similar molecular weights that are\ngenerated via internal translation initiation start sites (20). In\ncontrast, a highly signi\ufb01cant (P \t 0.002) 40 to 50% decrease in\nthe level of Sp4 in infected versus uninfected cell extracts was\nobserved.\nMutation of the Sp1/Sp3 site results in an increase in origin-\ndependent DNA replication.

VIROL.\n\nfor Sp1 and Sp3 resulted in an increase in origin-dependent\nDNA replication in DpnI resistance replication assays using a\nplasmid containing the HSV oriS. Analogous experiments\nwere performed in the work reported here in order to deter-\nmine the effects of mutation of the Sp1/Sp3 site in GC box 1\nand the downstream YY1 site. These experiments were per-\nformed by transfection of the pVO2 plasmid (48, 50) contain-\ning the VZV oriS sequence (OBP boxes C and A, the AT-rich\npalindrome, and the 125-bp downstream region) into MeWo\ncells followed by VZV superinfection at a ratio of 0.4/1 in-\nfected to uninfected cells. The cells were harvested 48 h after\nsuperinfection, and the state of the oriS-containing plasmid\nDNA was analyzed by DpnI digestion, followed by separation\non agarose gels and Southern blot hybridization. Blots were\nprobed with a 400-bp pVO2 fragment that allowed clear dif-\nferentiation between replicated (unmethylated, DpnI-resis-\ntant) progeny DNA and unreplicated (methylated DpnI-sensi-\ntive) input plasmids.\nControl DpnI replication assays using pVO2 containing the\nwild-type VZV oriS showed a clear and readily detectable\nsignal at the position predicted for the replicated DNA (Fig.\n7A). In contrast, assays performed under the same conditions\nusing the parent pAT153 plasmid lacking the VZV oriS re-\nsulted in no signal at the position of the replicated DNA. For\na second negative control, pVO2 containing a three-base sub-\nstitution in the box A OBP binding site was used. This also\nresulted in a loss of the replicated DNA band in agreement\nwith the results of Stow et al. (50) who showed via deletion that\nbox A is required for oriS-dependent DNA replication. Indi-\nvidual point mutations at the CGC positions were shown by\nChen and Olivo (8) to eliminate OBP binding. Thus, these data\ncon\ufb01rm the long-held supposition that OBP binding to box A\nis required for VZV oriS-dependent DNA replication even in\nthe presence of box C.\nIn the next series of experiments, triplicate DpnI assays were\nperformed using wild-type pVO2 and pVO2 plasmids contain-\ning the site-speci\ufb01c mutations within GC box 1 and the YY1\nsite which ablated Sp1/Sp3 and YY1 binding, respectively. As\nshown in Fig. 7B and C, mutation of GC box 1 increased the\nlevel of origin-dependent replication two- to threefold, and this\ndifference was statistically signi\ufb01cant (P \t 0.035). In contrast,\nthe YY1 substitution mutation had no statistically signi\ufb01cant\neffect (P \t 0.162) on the ef\ufb01ciency of origin-dependent repli-\ncation under these conditions.

This replication origin desig-\nnated oriS, is present within the inverted repeat sequences\nsurrounding the unique short (US) region of the VZV genome.\nThe structure of the VZV oriS is distinctly different from that\nof the oriS of HSV-1. While both contain an AT-rich palin-\ndrome 45 to 46 bp in length, the arrangement of binding sites\nfor the HSV and VZV OBPs differs signi\ufb01cantly. Speci\ufb01cally,\nthe HSV oriS contains experimentally veri\ufb01ed OBP binding\nsites oriented in opposite directions upstream and downstream\nof the AT-rich region (12, 49, 52, 53). In contrast, the three\nexperimentally veri\ufb01ed OBP binding sites within the VZV oriS\nare all located upstream of the AT-rich palindrome (8, 50).\nFurthermore, Stow and Davison (48) showed that a plasmid\ncontaining only the proximal OBP binding site, the AT-rich\npalindrome, and 125 bp of sequence downstream from the\nAT-rich sequence were suf\ufb01cient for origin-dependent replica-\ntion in DpnI replication assays.\nOur results show that the cellular transcription factors Sp1\nand Sp3 and possibly Sp4 interact with a GC-rich site (GC box\n1) downstream of the AT-rich palindrome. This is true despite\nthe fact that all four Sp family members are expressed in\nMeWo cells. Two complexes reproducibly formed with GC box\n1 were identi\ufb01ed by EMSA analysis and antibody supershifts,\nwith one being speci\ufb01c for Sp1 and the other speci\ufb01c for Sp3.\nPartial deletion and site-speci\ufb01c mutation of the GC box 1\nabolished formation of both complexes, providing further\nproof of speci\ufb01c binding. No difference in complex formation\nwas observed using infected and uninfected cell extracts, sug-\ngesting that upon infection, no additional viral or cellular pro-\nteins were recruited to these complexes. Sp1 and Sp3 belong to\nthe growing family of Sp/XKLF cellular transcription factors of\nwhich Sp1 is the prototype. Some 23 members of this family\nhave been identi\ufb01ed in the human genome based on the pres-\nence of a combination of three conserved Cys2His2 zinc \ufb01ngers\nthat form a DNA recognition motif (7). However, only Sp1,\nSp2, Sp3, and Sp4 have been extensively characterized as to\ntheir tissue speci\ufb01city and role(s) in transcription (7, 28, 42).\nSp1 through Sp4 all show a modular structure with activation\nand, in some cases inhibitory, domains present in their N-\nterminal regions and the characteristic set of zinc \ufb01ngers\npresent near their C termini. This similar modular structure\nhas resulted in their being designated a subgroup of the larger\nSp/XKLF family (7). Sp1 and Sp3 are believed to be ubiqui-\ntously expressed in all tissues, and both are capable of activat-\ning expression of mammalian genes via recognition of GC- and\nGT-rich motifs (28, 42). However, the interplay between Sp1\nand Sp3 is complex, with Sp3 sometimes acting as a repressor\nof Sp1 (28, 30). Sp2 lacks one of the N-terminal activation\ndomains and binds to a site different from that of Sp1, Sp3, and\nSp4 (33, 42). Sp2 is generally associated with repression of\ngenes activated by the other three members of the major Sp\nsubfamily. Expression of Sp4 has been detected in several cell\nlines (17, 23). However, in mammals, Sp4 is predominantly\nexpressed in tissues of neuronal origin, while the expression\nand activity of Sp1 in those tissues are downregulated (27,\n31, 57).\nSp1/Sp3 sites have been identi\ufb01ed in the replication origins\nof several DNA viruses, including HPV, SV40, EBV, and\nHSV-1 (5, 13, 15, 16, 24, 25, 37). The presence of the Sp1/Sp3\nsites has been associated with an enhancement of origin-de-\npendent DNA replication. Deletion or mutation of consensus\nGC boxes within the HPV and SV40 genomes resulted in\ndecreases in DNA replication ef\ufb01ciency. The mechanism of\nhow Sp1 enhances replication in these cases is unknown. How-\never, at least for the case of SV40, the Sp1 site in question does\nnot appear to be involved in transcription of the viral genome\n(13, 16). Sp1 and possibly other Sp family members also in\ufb02u-\nence origin-dependent EBV DNA replication at the cis-acting\nelement oriLyt (5, 15). This element consists of two essential\ndomains designated the upstream and downstream compo-\nnents. The upstream component contains DNA binding motifs\nfor the EBV transcriptional activator BZLF1. The downstream\ncomponent is known to be the binding site of cellular tran-\nscription factors ZBP-89 and Sp1, which stimulate DNA rep-\nlication. This stimulation is believed to result from the recruit-\nment of viral DNA replication proteins, since direct interaction\nof Sp1 and ZBP-89 with the viral DNA polymerase and its\nprocessivity factor was demonstrated in protein binding assays\n(5). The HSV-1 genome contains two oriS core-adjacent reg-\nulatory (Oscar) elements, OscarL and OscarR, at the base of\nthe oriS palindrome. Mutation of either element reduced oriS-\ndependent DNA replication by 60 to 70%, and disruption of\nboth elements reduced replication by 90%. OscarL contains a\nconsensus binding site for the transcription factor Sp1. EMSA\nand supershift experiments using antibodies directed against\nthe Sp family members of transcription factors demonstrated\nthe presence of Sp1 and Sp3, but not Sp2 or Sp4, in the\nprotein-DNA complexes formed at OscarL (37).\nIn contrast to our results with GC box 1, we found no\nevidence of interaction of any of the Sp family members with\nthe second GC-rich sequence (GC box 2), which was also\nthought to be a possible Sp1 binding site. Instead, the cellular\nfactor YY1 was found to bind to a predicted site overlapping\nGC box 2. These results represents the \ufb01rst experimentally\nveri\ufb01ed occurrence of YY1 binding to a VZV DNA sequence.\nYY1 is a 414-amino-acid zinc \ufb01nger protein that is capable of\nboth repression and activation of cellular genes and transcrip-\ntion in several virus systems, including adeno-associated virus,\nHPV, parvovirus B19, HSV-1, and murine leukemia virus (26,\n46). YY1 has been shown to repress HPV ori-dependent DNA\nreplication in a cell-free replication system. This repression,\nhowever, does not require the presence of a YY1 consensus\nbinding site or interaction of YY1 with HPV DNA. Rather, the\nYY1-mediated repression of HPV DNA replication is believed\nto be due to direct interaction between YY1 and the HPV E2\nprotein, a transcription factor that plays important roles in the\nassembly of the initiation complex at the HPV origin (25).\nOur results from DpnI replication assays show that a point\nmutation of GC box 1 that ablated the formation of the two\ncomplexes observed in EMSAs also resulted in a two- to three-\nfold increase in replication ef\ufb01ciency compared to that ob-\nserved with the wild-type virus. These \ufb01ndings concerning the\n11730\nKHALIL ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nfunction of the Sp1/Sp3 binding site within the VZV oriS\nindicate that interaction of Sp1 and Sp3 with the wild-type GC\nbox 1 sequence results in a suppression of origin-dependent\nreplication. This is in direct contrast to the function of such\nsites in the EBV and HSV-1 origins and represents a novel\n\ufb01nding for VZV. These results also represent the \ufb01rst docu-\nmentation of a role for Sp3 in the VZV replication cycle. Since\nthese data were obtained using a plasmid containing only\nthe VZV oriS, it will, in the future, be important to correlate these\n\ufb01ndings with the infectious phenotype of viruses carrying the GC\nbox 1 mutation at the native sites within the VZV genome.\nThe role or roles played by YY1 in VZV infection are\nunknown; thus, the identi\ufb01cation of a bona \ufb01de YY1 binding\nsite within the oriS downstream region site afforded the po-\ntential to identify a VZV-speci\ufb01c function for this ubiquitous\ncellular factor. YY1 has been shown to be capable of direct\ninteraction with Sp1 (24, 45), raising the possibility that bridg-\ning could occur between Sp1 and YY1 bound at their respec-\ntive sites in the downstream region of the VZV oriS. Mutation\nof the YY1 site with concomitant loss of YY1 binding, how-\never, resulted in no statistically signi\ufb01cant effect, eliminating\nthe possibility that a potential Sp1/YY1 bridging interaction\nmight in\ufb02uence replication ef\ufb01ciency under our experimental\nconditions. This does not eliminate the possibility that YY1\nplays an important role in VZV infection. YY1 could in\ufb02uence\ncellular functions vital for VZV lytic replication or interact\nfunctionally with IE62 or other VZV transactivators, such as\nthe IE4 and ORF61 proteins (18, 34, 35) at speci\ufb01c viral pro-\nmoters. Alternatively, YY1 could in\ufb02uence origin-dependent\nDNA replication in primary cells or in speci\ufb01c tissues infected\nby VZV in the human host. As an example, YY1 has been\nshown to act as a negative regulator of the EBV BRLF1 pro-\nmoter in both HeLa and Raji cells, but the level of suppression\nwas much greater in HeLa cells (56).\nThe data gathered on the ability of Sp1 and Sp3 to bind to\nthe GC box 1 site in the downstream region of oriS and the\nincreased oriS-dependent replication ef\ufb01ciency observed with\nmutations that ablate that binding led to the following model\nfor the role of the GC box 1 sequence analyzed during the\ncourse of this work (Fig. 8). At times immediately after infec-\ntion, endogenous Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the GC box 1 site. Once\nsuf\ufb01cient IE62 is synthesized, the most active phase of viral\ngene expression ensues, and at this stage Sp1 and Sp3 exchange\noff this site and interact physically and functionally with the\nmajor VZV transactivator IE62 to ef\ufb01ciently express the viral\ngenome. Previous work by Peng et al. (39) showed that as\nmuch as 20 to 25% of total Sp1 is associated with IE62 in\nVZV-infected cells. Additional support for this possibility\ncomes from experiments showing that ectopic expression of\nSp1 and Sp3 but not YY1 enhance IE62-mediated transacti-\nvation in transient-transfection assays (data not shown). The\nresulting decrease of Sp1 and Sp3 at GC box 1 would, based on\nour data, allow an increase in origin-dependent DNA replica-\ntion. During the late phase of the VZV life cycle, IE62 is\nexcluded, to a large extent, from the nucleus (21, 22), and Sp1\nand Sp3 could potentially rebind to this site and aid in decreas-\ning DNA replication during this phase of infection.\nThis model has broader implications in terms of the multi-\nfaceted nature of VZV pathogenesis. Our data show that in\nMeWo cells, VZV infection reduces expression of the Sp4\nprotein to a modest but reproducible extent and that interac-\ntion of Sp4 with the GC box 1 element is less stable than that\nobserved with Sp1 and Sp3. As indicated above, Sp4 is primar-\nily and dominantly expressed in neuronal tissue and is capable\nof binding to the consensus Sp1 site, whereas Sp1 expression is\ndownregulated. Therefore, it is possible that, under certain\nconditions, Sp4 may be able to compete with and displace Sp1\nat the VZV GC box 1 site as has been reported in the case of\nFIG. 8. Model summarizing a possible mechanism of Sp1/Sp3-dependent modulation of VZV DNA origin-dependent replication during the\nVZV life cycle. In this model, Sp1 and Sp3 cycle on and off the consensus GGGCGGG site within GC box 1 in response to requirements for their\npresence for IE62-mediated transcription at promoter sites within the VZV genome. Thus, their presence during the early phase of the virus life\ncycle would be minimal, resulting in increased DNA replication which also peaks at this phase. IE, immediate early.\nVOL. 82, 2008\nCELLULAR FACTORS AND VZV DNA REPLICATION\n11731\n\nthe human ADH5/FDH promoter (23). If Sp4, like Sp1 en-\nhances IE62-mediated transactivation, the combination of nor-\nmally decreased expression of Sp1 in neurons and reduction of\nSp4 levels due to infection could lead to a reduction of VZV\ngene expression upon initial neuronal infection and a general\ncessation of viral replication. Alternatively, if Sp4 does not\nsynergize with IE62 but binds to the GC box 1 element, it\ncould, even at reduced levels and possibly in conjunction with\nneuronal factors, act to suppress VZV DNA replication. Both\nof these scenarios would likely increase the chances for a\nswitch from lytic to latent infection. Conversely, low levels of\nSp1 and decreased levels of Sp4 during reactivation could lead\nto increased ef\ufb01ciency of viral DNA replication. Thus, the\ncis-acting GC box 1 element within the downstream region of\nVZV oriS and the interplay of various levels of Sp1 and Sp4\ncould potentially be involved in the establishment and/or re-\nactivation of VZV latency.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by NIH grants AI18449 and AI36884.\nM.I.K. was supported in part by a scholarship from the Egyptian\nMinistry of Higher Education.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Ruyechan*\nDepartment of Microbiology and Immunology and Witebsky Center for Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology,\nUniversity at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, New York 14214\nReceived 24 June 2008/Accepted 18 September 2008\nThe varicella-zoster virus (VZV) origin of DNA replication (oriS) contains a 46-bp AT-rich palindrome and\nthree consensus binding sites for the VZV origin binding protein (OBP) encoded by VZV ORF51. All three OBP\nbinding sites are upstream of the palindrome in contrast to the sequence of the herpes simplex virus oriS,\nwhich has required OBP binding sites upstream and downstream of the AT-rich region. We are investigating\nthe roles that sequences downstream of the palindrome play in VZV oriS-dependent DNA replication. Com-\nputer analysis identi\ufb01ed two GC boxes, GC box 1 and GC box 2, in the downstream region which were predicted\nto be binding sites for the cellular transcription factor Sp1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift\nassays showed that two members of the Sp family (Sp1 and Sp3) stably bind to GC box 1, but not to GC box\n2. A predicted binding site for the cellular factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) that overlaps with GC box 2 was also\nidenti\ufb01ed. Supershift and mutational analyses con\ufb01rmed the binding of YY1 to this site. Mutation of GC box\n1 resulted in loss of Sp1 and Sp3 binding and an increase in origin-dependent replication ef\ufb01ciency in DpnI\nreplication assays. In contrast, mutation of the YY1 site had a statistically insigni\ufb01cant effect. These results\nsuggest a model where origin-dependent DNA replication and viral transcription are coupled by the binding\nof Sp1 and Sp3 to the downstream region of the VZV replication origin during lytic infection. They may also\nhave implications regarding establishment or reactivation of viral latency.\nVaricella-zoster virus (VZV) is a member of the Alphaher-\npesvirus subfamily of the Herpesviridae family. VZV is the caus-\native agent of two types of disease, chicken pox (varicella)\nupon primary infection and shingles (zoster) after reactivation\nfrom latency (1, 2). The VZV genome consists of 125 kbp\nwhich encodes approximately 69 open reading frames (ORFs).\nThe viral genome is made up of long and short unique seg-\nments designated UL and US, respectively, both of which are\nbounded by inverted repeat sequences (11). The linear se-\nquence of VZV genes is similar to that of herpes simplex virus\ntype 1 (HSV-1) and includes the coding sequences for ortho-\nlogues of the seven HSV-1 proteins required for origin-depen-\ndent DNA replication (9).\nThe VZV genome contains two origins of DNA replication\n(oriS) within the internal repeats (IRs) and terminal repeats\n(TRs) bounding the US segment at sites analogous to those\nwithin the HSV-1 genome. VZV, however, lacks the third\nHSV-1 origin (oriL), which is located near the center of the\nHSV-1 UL region (10, 11, 48, 49). HSV-1 oriL has been shown\nto be dispensable for replication of HSV DNA (3, 53) but has\nbeen implicated in HSV pathogenesis and reactivation from\nlatency (4). The equivalent region in the VZV genome is\ncomprised of a bidirectional promoter that regulates the tran-\nscription of the VZV DNA polymerase catalytic subunit\n(ORF28) and DNA binding protein (ORF29) genes (32, 54).\nThe architecture of the VZV and HSV-1 oriS regions differs\nsigni\ufb01cantly (Fig. 1). The two VZV oriS regions contain an\nAT-rich palindrome and three consensus 10-bp binding sites\n[5\u0002-C(G/A)TTCGCACT-3\u0002] for the VZV origin binding pro-\ntein (OBP) encoded by VZV ORF51 located upstream of the\nAT-rich palindrome (48, 50). These binding sites, designated\nboxes A, B, and C are identical or nearly identical to the\nconsensus site for the HSV-1 UL9 OBP with which the VZV\nORF51 OBP shares 54.8% similarity and 46.5% identity (8,\n50). All three OBP binding sites in the VZV origin are ori-\nented in the same direction and are present on the same strand\nof the viral DNA. Origin-dependent DNA replication in VZV\nrequires the AT-rich region and box A. Box C is not essential,\nbut its presence increases replication ef\ufb01ciency, while box B\nappears to be completely dispensable (48, 50). Nothing is cur-\nrently known regarding the role played by sequences down-\nstream of the VZV minimal origin in viral DNA replication. A\npartial (7 of 10 bp) OBP binding site is present downstream of\nthe AT-rich palindrome with the same orientation and on the\nsame strand as the upstream OBP boxes. However, gel shift\nand DNase I protection assays failed to demonstrate VZV\nOBP binding to this sequence (8, 50). In contrast, in the HSV-1\noriS, binding sites for the UL9 OBP (boxes I, II, and III) occur\nboth upstream and downstream of the AT-rich region. Boxes I\nand II are located upstream and downstream on opposite\nstrands of the DNA and are oriented in opposite directions.\nBox III is located upstream of box I but is oriented in the same\ndirection and occurs on the same DNA strand as box II. Mu-\ntational analysis has shown that the minimal HSV-1 requires\nthe presence of both box I and box II and the central AT-rich\nregion (4, 12, 49, 52).\nThe structural differences between the VZV and HSV-1 oriS\nin terms of the positioning and orientation of the OBP binding\nsites suggest that the mechanism and/or transacting factors\n* Corresponding author.

One possi-\nbility raised by Stow et al. (50) is that cellular factors or as yet\nunidenti\ufb01ed viral proteins could bind downstream of the AT-\nrich region in the VZV oriS to facilitate unwinding of the\norigin and assembly of the viral DNA replication machinery.\nThere is precedence for this possibility based on work with\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV), HSV-1, simian virus 40 (SV40), and\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV). The cellular transcription factor\nSp1 binds to the downstream region of EBV ORILyt and phys-\nically interacts with the EBV DNA polymerase catalytic and\naccessory subunits, increasing their recruitment and resulting\nin a positive effect on DNA replication (5, 15). Sp1 and the\nrelated factor Sp3 bind to the upstream region of the HSV-1\noriS at a cis element, designated OscarL, and also have a\npositive effect on origin-dependent DNA replication, although\nthe speci\ufb01c mechanism remains unknown (37). Several tran-\nscription factors were found to stimulate SV40 DNA replica-\ntion, including NF1, AP1, and Sp1 (16). Sp1 has also been\nreported (13) to enhance replication of human papillomavirus\ntype 18 (HPV18). In contrast, the transcription factor Yin\nYang 1 (YY1) has been shown to suppress HPV DNA repli-\ncation through interference with the function of the HPV E2\nprotein (25).\nIn the work presented here, we identi\ufb01ed and authenticated\nthe presence of binding sites for cellular transcription factors\nwithin the downstream region of the VZV oriS and tested the\neffects of mutations of those sequences on VZV origin-depen-\ndent replication. Our data show that the cellular factors Sp1,\nSp3, and YY1 stably bind to different portions of the down-\nstream region of the VZV oriS. YY1 appears to have no effect\non origin-dependent replication. However, mutation of the\nSp1/Sp3 site that ablates binding of these factors resulted in an\nincrease in replication in in situ DpnI replication assays. This\nindicates that Sp1 and Sp3 act to suppress VZV oriS-depen-\ndent replication in contrast to what has been observed, as\ndescribed above, in other virus systems. Further, this repre-\nsents the \ufb01rst documentation of a role for Sp3 in VZV infec-\ntion.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCells and viruses. MeWo cells, a human melanoma cell line that supports the\nreplication of VZV, were grown in Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium supple-\nmented with 10% fetal bovine serum as previously described (47). VZV strain\nMSP was propagated in MeWo cell monolayers as described by Lynch et al. (29)\nand Peng et al. (39).\nNuclear and whole-cell lysates. Nuclear extracts of VZV-infected and unin-\nfected MeWo cells were prepared as previously described (29). Brie\ufb02y, pelleted\ncells were washed once with 30 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. Packed\ncells were resuspended in one packed cell volume of buffer A (10 mM HEPES\n[pH 7.9], 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) at 4\u00b0C and allowed\nto swell on ice for 15 min. Cells were then lysed by 10 rapid passages through a\n25-gauge hypodermic syringe, and the homogenate was sedimented brie\ufb02y at\n12,000 \u0003 g. The crude nuclear pellet was resuspended in two-thirds of one\npacked cell volume (determined at the time of cell harvest) of buffer C (20 mM\nHEPES [pH 7.9], 25% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM\nEDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \ufb02uoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol), and the\nresulting solution was incubated on ice with stirring for 30 min. The nuclear\ndebris was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 \u0003 g, and the supernatant\n(nuclear extract) was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 20%\n[vol/vol] glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl\n\ufb02uoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) for 2 h. The dialyzed extract was then quick-\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u000470\u00b0C. Whole-cell lysates of VZV-\ninfected and uninfected MeWo cells were prepared as previously described (39).\nCells were grown to con\ufb02uence in 100-mm petri dishes, washed with phosphate-\nbuffered saline buffer, and then suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH\n7.5], 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor\ncocktail [Roche, Mannheim, Germany] added per the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntion). The lysates were collected and centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatants\nwere stored at \u000470\u00b0C for subsequent use.\nImmunoblot analyses. Whole-cell lysates of VZV-infected and uninfected\nMeWo cells were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-10% polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis and immunoblotting for the presence of Sp family members and\nYY1 as described by Yang et al. (55). Antibodies against Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Sp4, and\n\u0005-tubulin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).\nAntibody against Sp1 was also obtained from Upstate (Temecula, CA). Rabbit\npolyclonal antibody against YY1 was generously supplied by Te-Chung Lee\n(University at Buffalo). Reactive bands were visualized using goat anti-rabbit\nFIG. 1.

Quanti\ufb01cation of the relative amounts of these\ntranscription factors normalized to \u0005-tubulin in loading controls was performed\nusing a Bio-Rad GS700 imagining densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Sta-\ntistical signi\ufb01cance was determined by a one-way analysis of variance, followed by\nTukey\u2019s post hoc test.\nPlasmids. The pVO2 plasmid containing a 259-bp fragment encompassing\nnucleotides 5502 to 5760 of the TRs/IRs sequence of the VZV Dumas strain (10)\nwas generously supplied by Nigel Stow (MRC Virology Unit, Institute of Virol-\nogy, University of Glasgow). This fragment contains the VZV oriS region in-\ncluding OBP boxes C and A, the AT-rich palindrome, and 125 bp of downstream\nsequence. The pVO2 parental plasmid, pAT153, was purchased from MoBiTec\n(Goettingen, Germany).\nPlasmids containing GC box 1 and YY1 and box A substitution mutations\nwithin the oriS region were generated by mutation of pVO2 using the\nQuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the\nfollowing primer sets: primers 5\u0002-ATGTCGCGGTTTTATGGGGTGTTCGCG\nGGCTTTTCACAGAATATA-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-TATATTCTGTGAAAAGCCCGCG\nAACACCCCATAAAACCGCGACAT-3\u0002 for GC box 1, primers 5\u0002-ACAGAA\nTATATATATTCCAAATTTAGCGGCAGGCTTTTTAAAATC-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-G\nATTTTAAAAAGCCTGCCGCTAAATTTGGAATATATATATTCTGT-3\u0002\nfor YY1, and primers 5\u0002-GGCATGTGTCCAACCACCGTTAAAACTTTCTT\nTCTATATATATAT-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-ATATATATATAGAAAGAAAGTTTTAACG\nGTGGTTGGACACATGCC-3\u0002 for box A. All primers were synthesized by IDT\n(Coralville, IA). The positions and sequences of the mutations in the VZV oriS\nsequence contained within the pVO2 plasmid used in transfections were veri\ufb01ed\nby sequencing at the Roswell Park sequencing facility.\nDpnI replication assays. MeWo cells were transfected with Lipofectamine\nreagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nFour microliters of Lipofectamine reagent was used per microgram of trans-\nfected DNA in each transfection. In transfections performed in 100-mm-diam-\neter petri dishes, 2.1 \u0003 106 MeWo cells per dish were seeded in 12 ml of\ncomplete growth medium. The cells were 80% con\ufb02uent at the time of transfec-\ntion. Three hours before transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh\nmedium. Replication experiments were performed as described by Stow and\nMcMonagle (49) and Stow and Davison (48). The cells were transfected with 5\n\u0006g of wild-type or mutant pVO2 plasmids. At 6 h posttransfection, cells were\nsuperinfected with VZV strain MSP. VZV superinfections were performed by\nadding a ratio of 0.4 infected cell per 1 uninfected cell of the infected cells to\neach monolayer. Total cellular DNA was prepared 48 h after superinfection by\nthe addition of 5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 0.5%\nsodium dodecyl sulfate, 20 \u0006g/ml RNase I) per dish. Lysates were transferred to\n15-ml conical test tubes and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Proteinase K in TE buffer\n(10 mM Tris-HCl and 0.001 M EDTA) was added to a \ufb01nal concentration of 100\n\u0006g per ml, and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 0.15 M. The mixture was\nthen incubated at 50\u00b0C for 3 h. The DNA was isolated by phenol chloroform\nextraction, followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was digested with DpnI\nand EcoRI as described by Stow and Davison (48) and analyzed by Southern blot\nhybridization. Transfers were done using TurboBlotter kits obtained from What-\nman, Inc. (Sanford, ME). The blots were probed with a 400-bp PCR product\nprepared from pVO2 using primers 5\u0002-GTGCTCCTGTCGTTGAGGACCCG\nG-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-CCTCTGACTTGAGCGTCGATTTTT-3\u0002 and end labeled with[\u0007-\n32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This fragment includes a\nportion (nucleotide positions 1465 to 1864) of the pVO2 plasmid containing the\nColE1 origin of replication and was designed to detect both intact DpnI-resistant\nlinearized pVO2 (3.9 kb) resulting from replication of the input plasmid and an\n872-bp fragment resulting from the DpnI-sensitive unreplicated input plasmid.\nThe resulting bands were quanti\ufb01ed by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics,\nSunnyvale, CA) analysis. The ratio of replicated plasmid to input plasmid rep-\nresented the replication ef\ufb01ciency of the test plasmid. The data from represen-\ntative experiments are presented as means of triplicate DpnI replications. Error\nbars indicate standard errors. Statistical signi\ufb01cance was determined by a one-\nway analysis of variance followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test.\nEMSA and supershift analyses. Thirty-base-pair oligonucleotide probes (IDT,\nCoralville, IA) containing wild-type and mutant GC box 1 elements and 40-bp\nprobes containing wild-type and mutant YY1 and GC box 2 binding site elements\nwere used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Probes were end\nlabeled with [\u0007-32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For the GC\nbox 1 probes, 100 femtomoles of the 30-bp labeled probes containing wild-type\nand mutant GC box 1 (\b1 \u0003 105 dpm) were incubated with 12 \u0006g of uninfected\nor infected MeWo cell nuclear extract in a 10-\u0006l reaction mixture in binding\nbuffer A [40 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 \u0006g/ml\nbovine serum albumin, 12% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 3\n\u0006g poly(dI-dC)]. For the GC box 2/YY1 probes, 100 femtomoles of 40-bp labeled\nprobes containing wild-type and mutant GC box 2 sequences or wild-type and\nmutant YY1 binding sites (\b1 \u0003 105 dpm) were incubated with 12 \u0006g of MeWo\ncell nuclear extracts in a 10-\u0006l reaction mixture in binding buffer B [10 mM\nTris-HCl (pH 8.0), l mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 3 \u0006g poly(dI-dC), 0.1% NP-40,\n1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 \u0006g/ml bovine serum albumin]. The samples were\nanalyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacryl-\namide) gel and then autoradiography.\nIn the supershift assays, anti-Sp family antibodies (antibodies against the four\nmembers of the Sp family [Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4]) obtained from Santa Cruz\nBiologicals (Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-Sp1 antibodies (Upstate, Temecula, CA)\nand rabbit polyclonal YY1 antiserum, generously supplied by Te-Chung Lee\n(University at Buffalo) were added in 4-\u0006g (Sp family) or 2-\u0006l (YY1) aliquots to\nreaction mixtures containing infected cell nuclear extracts and either GC box 1\nor YY1/GC box 2 probes. All of the antibodies directed against the Sp family\nmembers were described by the commercial suppliers as being positive in super-\nshift assays. This was con\ufb01rmed in control experiments using consensus GC\nbox-containing duplex probes (data not shown). The samples were then analyzed\nby electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel\nand autoradiography.\nRESULTS\nIdenti\ufb01cation of potential binding sites for cellular factors\nin the downstream region of VZV oriS. The 125 bp immedi-\nately downstream of the AT-rich palindrome of the VZV\noriS, located within the IRs region of the genome, were\nanalyzed for the presence of cellular transcription factor\nbinding sites using the AliBaba2.1 and Patch programs (http:\n//www.gene-regulation.com/pub/programs.html; Biobase). Two\nGC-rich sequences, designated GC box 1 and GC box 2, were\nidenti\ufb01ed 57 to 72 bp and 99 to 110 bp, respectively, 3\u0002 to the\n\ufb01nal TA pair in the minimal origin (Fig. 1B). Both contained\npredicted binding sites for the ubiquitous cellular transcription\nfactor Sp1. GC box 1 contains the canonical Sp1 binding\nsequence (5\u0002-GGGCGGG-3\u0002) \ufb01rst identi\ufb01ed by Dynan and\nTjian (14) in the SV40 early promoter. GC box 2 contains an\nalternative site (5\u0002-GGAGCGG-3\u0002) predicted to bind Sp1. Sp1\nis well documented to be involved in VZV replication based on\nstudies describing its role in several important VZV promot-\ners, including those regulating expression of VZV gI, gE, the\nVZV major single-strand binding protein, and the VZV DNA\npolymerase catalytic subunit (6, 19, 39, 43, 54). Sp1 has also\nbeen shown to interact physically and functionally with the\nVZV major transcriptional activator, IE62 (36, 39). In addi-\ntion, there is a high incidence of predicted Sp1 binding sites\nwithin VZV promoters (a minimum of 18) beyond those al-\nready authenticated (44).\nA potential binding site (5\u0002-CAAATGGAG-3\u0002) for the cel-\nlular transcription factor YY1 was also identi\ufb01ed partially\noverlapping GC box 2. This sequence is highly homologous to\na YY1 site identi\ufb01ed in the HPV8 E6 promoter (5\u0002-CAAAT\nGGAC-3\u0002) and is also very similar to YY1 sites identi\ufb01ed in\nadeno-associated virus P5 promoter and the murine leukemia\nvirus long terminal repeat (26, 38). YY1 can act either as an\nactivator or a repressor and has been shown to be capable of\ninteracting with Sp1 (24, 45, 46). In contrast to Sp1, the role or\nroles that YY1 plays in VZV transcription and the viral life\ncycle are currently unknown. Based on the results from the\ncomputer analysis, EMSA, supershift, and mutational analyses\nwere then performed in order to determine whether GC box 1,\nGC box 2, and the YY1 site were bona \ufb01de binding targets for\nthe speci\ufb01c transcription factors.\nVOL. 82, 2008\nCELLULAR FACTORS AND VZV DNA REPLICATION\n11725\n\nSp1 and Sp3 bind to GC box 1. In the \ufb01rst series of exper-\niments, EMSAs were performed using a 30-bp duplex oligo-\nnucleotide containing the 15-bp GC box 1 and upstream and\ndownstream \ufb02anking sequences (Fig. 2A). Shift patterns were\nobtained using uninfected and VZV-infected MeWo cell nu-\nclear extracts. Two complexes, one major and one minor, were\nconsistently observed with both infected and uninfected nu-\nclear extracts, with the major complex being the slower migrat-\ning of the two (Fig. 2B). There was no difference in the shift\npattern, qualitatively or quantitatively, obtained with the two\nnuclear extracts, suggesting that viral proteins and/or cellular\nproteins whose expression or DNA binding properties were\nsigni\ufb01cantly modi\ufb01ed by VZV infection did not play a role in\nthe formation of the observed complexes. To test the speci\ufb01city\nof the formation of these two complexes, competition EMSA\nexperiments were performed using the unlabeled 30-bp GC\nbox 1 probe as the speci\ufb01c competitor and a 30-bp oligonucle-\notide containing the OBP box A sequence as the nonspeci\ufb01c\ncompetitor. As shown in Fig. 2C, the cold speci\ufb01c competitor\nef\ufb01ciently competed away the formation of the two complexes,\nwhile the presence of the nonspeci\ufb01c competitor had no effect\non the pattern of the shifted bands.\nIn the next series of experiments, EMSAs were performed\nusing oligonucleotides containing mutations in the consensus\nSp1 binding site in the GC box 1 sequence. These included\ndeletion of the 7-base-pair Sp1 binding site and site-speci\ufb01c\nmutagenesis which substituted the \ufb01rst two G residues with T\nand C, respectively (Fig. 3A). Both of these mutations were\npredicted to abolish Sp1 binding using the same computer\nanalysis that had initially identi\ufb01ed the site. As shown in Fig.\n3B, both the deletion and substitution mutations ablated for-\nmation of both of the complexes formed with the wild-type\nsequence.\nAntibody supershift assays were then performed in order to\ncon\ufb01rm that Sp1 was, in fact, present in the observed com-\nplexes and to investigate whether any of the other three major\nmembers of the Sp family of transcription factors (Sp2, Sp3,\nand Sp4), all of which are capable of binding to GC-rich se-\nquences (17, 42), were also present. The results are presented\nin Fig. 3C and show that a signi\ufb01cant fraction of the major,\nslower-migrating complex was supershifted only in the pres-\nence of anti-Sp1 antibody. Two anti-Sp1-speci\ufb01c supershifted\ncomplexes were consistently observed in these experiments.\nOne migrated slightly more slowly than the major complex did,\nand the second, representing the majority of the supershifted\nmaterial, failed to enter the gel. The less-abundant faster-\nmigrating complex was completely supershifted only in the\npresence of anti-Sp3 antibody. In the data presented in Fig. 3C,\na small amount of material failed to enter the gel in the pres-\nence of anti-Sp4 antibody. This occurred in three of \ufb01ve sep-\narate EMSA experiments, whereas the shifts observed with the\nSp1 and Sp3 antibodies occurred in all \ufb01ve experiments. In\ncontrast, no supershifts or losses of complexes were observed\nin the presence of anti-Sp2 antibodies. Anti-YY1 antibody,\nFIG. 2.

VIROL.\n\nused here as a negative control, also showed no effect on\ncomplex formation or migration. Thus, Sp1 is present in at\nleast one complex within the major supershifted band. Sp3\nappears to be present exclusively in the complex represented\nby the less-abundant, faster-migrating band. Sp4 may also be\nassociated with GC box 1 but to a much lower and less stable\nextent than Sp1 and Sp3 under these experimental conditions.\nYY1 binds to the predicted YY1 binding site. In the next\nseries of experiments, we wished to determine whether protein\ncomplexes were formed with duplex oligonucleotides contain-\ning GC box 2 sequence and the predicted overlapping YY1\nbinding site. EMSAs were performed using a 40-bp probe\ncontaining both sequences and 8-bp upstream and 15-bp down-\nstream \ufb02anking sequences (Fig. 4A). Shifts were performed\nwith both uninfected and infected MeWo cell extracts. Three\nmajor complexes were formed in the presence of both unin-\nfected and infected cell nuclear extracts and displayed identical\nmigration positions (Fig. 4B). A decrease in the level of the\nintermediate migrating complex with infected protein extracts\ncompared to uninfected protein extracts was frequently ob-\nserved in these experiments, suggesting that this complex is less\nstable in the case of the infected cell extracts.\nWe next wished to determine whether any of the Sp family\nmembers or YY1 bound to this sequence. Supershift experi-\nments with antibodies against Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 indicated\nthat, in contrast to our results with GC box 1, none of these\nfactors bound to the probe containing GC box 2 (data not\nshown). Supershifts with anti-YY1, however, consistently re-\nsulted in loss of the fastest-migrating band in the case of the\nwild-type sequence and with probes containing deletion and\nsubstitution mutations predicted to disrupt the binding of Sp1\n(Fig. 5). In each of these cases, signal was present in the well,\nFIG. 3. EMSA and supershift assays using wild-type, GC box 1 deletion, and substitution mutant duplex oligonucleotides.

Finally, site-speci\ufb01c mutation of the YY1 site led to loss of\nthe fastest-migrating band, and here, no signal was seen in the\nwell in the presence of anti-YY1 antibody.\nThus, our results show that YY1 binds to the predicted YY1\nbinding site, whereas there is no evidence either by supershift\nassays or by mutational analysis that any members of the Sp\nfamily bind to this portion of the downstream region of VZV\noriS. The site-speci\ufb01c and deletion mutations narrow the YY1\nsite to 5\u0002-CCAAATGG-3\u0002 and indicate that the two 3\u0002-termi-\nnal guanine residues are critical for YY1 binding. The persis-\ntence of the two slower-migrating bands suggests that their\nformation involves the \ufb02anking regions, rather than the core\nelements mutated. This was con\ufb01rmed in competition experi-\nments where the cold 40-bp probe successfully competed away\nall three complexes (data not shown).\nVZV infection lowers the level of Sp4 present in MeWo cells.\nWe next examined the levels of Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 and\nYY1 present in uninfected and infected whole-cell extracts by\nimmunoblotting. Our results (Fig. 6) show that all four Sp\nfamily members and YY1 are expressed in MeWo cells. Quan-\nti\ufb01cation of the relative amounts of these factors using three\nsets of paired uninfected and infected cell extract preparations\nshowed that there was no statistically signi\ufb01cant difference in\nthe levels of Sp1 (P \t 0.373), Sp2 (P \t 0.254), Sp3 (P \t 0.563),\nand YY1 (P \t 0.373) in infected versus uninfected MeWo cell\nextracts. Also, infection did not alter the levels of the two\nshorter forms of Sp3 of very similar molecular weights that are\ngenerated via internal translation initiation start sites (20). In\ncontrast, a highly signi\ufb01cant (P \t 0.002) 40 to 50% decrease in\nthe level of Sp4 in infected versus uninfected cell extracts was\nobserved.\nMutation of the Sp1/Sp3 site results in an increase in origin-\ndependent DNA replication.

VIROL.\n\nfor Sp1 and Sp3 resulted in an increase in origin-dependent\nDNA replication in DpnI resistance replication assays using a\nplasmid containing the HSV oriS. Analogous experiments\nwere performed in the work reported here in order to deter-\nmine the effects of mutation of the Sp1/Sp3 site in GC box 1\nand the downstream YY1 site. These experiments were per-\nformed by transfection of the pVO2 plasmid (48, 50) contain-\ning the VZV oriS sequence (OBP boxes C and A, the AT-rich\npalindrome, and the 125-bp downstream region) into MeWo\ncells followed by VZV superinfection at a ratio of 0.4/1 in-\nfected to uninfected cells. The cells were harvested 48 h after\nsuperinfection, and the state of the oriS-containing plasmid\nDNA was analyzed by DpnI digestion, followed by separation\non agarose gels and Southern blot hybridization. Blots were\nprobed with a 400-bp pVO2 fragment that allowed clear dif-\nferentiation between replicated (unmethylated, DpnI-resis-\ntant) progeny DNA and unreplicated (methylated DpnI-sensi-\ntive) input plasmids.\nControl DpnI replication assays using pVO2 containing the\nwild-type VZV oriS showed a clear and readily detectable\nsignal at the position predicted for the replicated DNA (Fig.\n7A). In contrast, assays performed under the same conditions\nusing the parent pAT153 plasmid lacking the VZV oriS re-\nsulted in no signal at the position of the replicated DNA. For\na second negative control, pVO2 containing a three-base sub-\nstitution in the box A OBP binding site was used. This also\nresulted in a loss of the replicated DNA band in agreement\nwith the results of Stow et al. (50) who showed via deletion that\nbox A is required for oriS-dependent DNA replication. Indi-\nvidual point mutations at the CGC positions were shown by\nChen and Olivo (8) to eliminate OBP binding. Thus, these data\ncon\ufb01rm the long-held supposition that OBP binding to box A\nis required for VZV oriS-dependent DNA replication even in\nthe presence of box C.\nIn the next series of experiments, triplicate DpnI assays were\nperformed using wild-type pVO2 and pVO2 plasmids contain-\ning the site-speci\ufb01c mutations within GC box 1 and the YY1\nsite which ablated Sp1/Sp3 and YY1 binding, respectively. As\nshown in Fig. 7B and C, mutation of GC box 1 increased the\nlevel of origin-dependent replication two- to threefold, and this\ndifference was statistically signi\ufb01cant (P \t 0.035). In contrast,\nthe YY1 substitution mutation had no statistically signi\ufb01cant\neffect (P \t 0.162) on the ef\ufb01ciency of origin-dependent repli-\ncation under these conditions.

This replication origin desig-\nnated oriS, is present within the inverted repeat sequences\nsurrounding the unique short (US) region of the VZV genome.\nThe structure of the VZV oriS is distinctly different from that\nof the oriS of HSV-1. While both contain an AT-rich palin-\ndrome 45 to 46 bp in length, the arrangement of binding sites\nfor the HSV and VZV OBPs differs signi\ufb01cantly. Speci\ufb01cally,\nthe HSV oriS contains experimentally veri\ufb01ed OBP binding\nsites oriented in opposite directions upstream and downstream\nof the AT-rich region (12, 49, 52, 53). In contrast, the three\nexperimentally veri\ufb01ed OBP binding sites within the VZV oriS\nare all located upstream of the AT-rich palindrome (8, 50).\nFurthermore, Stow and Davison (48) showed that a plasmid\ncontaining only the proximal OBP binding site, the AT-rich\npalindrome, and 125 bp of sequence downstream from the\nAT-rich sequence were suf\ufb01cient for origin-dependent replica-\ntion in DpnI replication assays.\nOur results show that the cellular transcription factors Sp1\nand Sp3 and possibly Sp4 interact with a GC-rich site (GC box\n1) downstream of the AT-rich palindrome. This is true despite\nthe fact that all four Sp family members are expressed in\nMeWo cells. Two complexes reproducibly formed with GC box\n1 were identi\ufb01ed by EMSA analysis and antibody supershifts,\nwith one being speci\ufb01c for Sp1 and the other speci\ufb01c for Sp3.\nPartial deletion and site-speci\ufb01c mutation of the GC box 1\nabolished formation of both complexes, providing further\nproof of speci\ufb01c binding. No difference in complex formation\nwas observed using infected and uninfected cell extracts, sug-\ngesting that upon infection, no additional viral or cellular pro-\nteins were recruited to these complexes. Sp1 and Sp3 belong to\nthe growing family of Sp/XKLF cellular transcription factors of\nwhich Sp1 is the prototype. Some 23 members of this family\nhave been identi\ufb01ed in the human genome based on the pres-\nence of a combination of three conserved Cys2His2 zinc \ufb01ngers\nthat form a DNA recognition motif (7). However, only Sp1,\nSp2, Sp3, and Sp4 have been extensively characterized as to\ntheir tissue speci\ufb01city and role(s) in transcription (7, 28, 42).\nSp1 through Sp4 all show a modular structure with activation\nand, in some cases inhibitory, domains present in their N-\nterminal regions and the characteristic set of zinc \ufb01ngers\npresent near their C termini. This similar modular structure\nhas resulted in their being designated a subgroup of the larger\nSp/XKLF family (7). Sp1 and Sp3 are believed to be ubiqui-\ntously expressed in all tissues, and both are capable of activat-\ning expression of mammalian genes via recognition of GC- and\nGT-rich motifs (28, 42). However, the interplay between Sp1\nand Sp3 is complex, with Sp3 sometimes acting as a repressor\nof Sp1 (28, 30). Sp2 lacks one of the N-terminal activation\ndomains and binds to a site different from that of Sp1, Sp3, and\nSp4 (33, 42). Sp2 is generally associated with repression of\ngenes activated by the other three members of the major Sp\nsubfamily. Expression of Sp4 has been detected in several cell\nlines (17, 23). However, in mammals, Sp4 is predominantly\nexpressed in tissues of neuronal origin, while the expression\nand activity of Sp1 in those tissues are downregulated (27,\n31, 57).\nSp1/Sp3 sites have been identi\ufb01ed in the replication origins\nof several DNA viruses, including HPV, SV40, EBV, and\nHSV-1 (5, 13, 15, 16, 24, 25, 37). The presence of the Sp1/Sp3\nsites has been associated with an enhancement of origin-de-\npendent DNA replication. Deletion or mutation of consensus\nGC boxes within the HPV and SV40 genomes resulted in\ndecreases in DNA replication ef\ufb01ciency. The mechanism of\nhow Sp1 enhances replication in these cases is unknown. How-\never, at least for the case of SV40, the Sp1 site in question does\nnot appear to be involved in transcription of the viral genome\n(13, 16). Sp1 and possibly other Sp family members also in\ufb02u-\nence origin-dependent EBV DNA replication at the cis-acting\nelement oriLyt (5, 15). This element consists of two essential\ndomains designated the upstream and downstream compo-\nnents. The upstream component contains DNA binding motifs\nfor the EBV transcriptional activator BZLF1. The downstream\ncomponent is known to be the binding site of cellular tran-\nscription factors ZBP-89 and Sp1, which stimulate DNA rep-\nlication. This stimulation is believed to result from the recruit-\nment of viral DNA replication proteins, since direct interaction\nof Sp1 and ZBP-89 with the viral DNA polymerase and its\nprocessivity factor was demonstrated in protein binding assays\n(5). The HSV-1 genome contains two oriS core-adjacent reg-\nulatory (Oscar) elements, OscarL and OscarR, at the base of\nthe oriS palindrome. Mutation of either element reduced oriS-\ndependent DNA replication by 60 to 70%, and disruption of\nboth elements reduced replication by 90%. OscarL contains a\nconsensus binding site for the transcription factor Sp1. EMSA\nand supershift experiments using antibodies directed against\nthe Sp family members of transcription factors demonstrated\nthe presence of Sp1 and Sp3, but not Sp2 or Sp4, in the\nprotein-DNA complexes formed at OscarL (37).\nIn contrast to our results with GC box 1, we found no\nevidence of interaction of any of the Sp family members with\nthe second GC-rich sequence (GC box 2), which was also\nthought to be a possible Sp1 binding site. Instead, the cellular\nfactor YY1 was found to bind to a predicted site overlapping\nGC box 2. These results represents the \ufb01rst experimentally\nveri\ufb01ed occurrence of YY1 binding to a VZV DNA sequence.\nYY1 is a 414-amino-acid zinc \ufb01nger protein that is capable of\nboth repression and activation of cellular genes and transcrip-\ntion in several virus systems, including adeno-associated virus,\nHPV, parvovirus B19, HSV-1, and murine leukemia virus (26,\n46). YY1 has been shown to repress HPV ori-dependent DNA\nreplication in a cell-free replication system. This repression,\nhowever, does not require the presence of a YY1 consensus\nbinding site or interaction of YY1 with HPV DNA. Rather, the\nYY1-mediated repression of HPV DNA replication is believed\nto be due to direct interaction between YY1 and the HPV E2\nprotein, a transcription factor that plays important roles in the\nassembly of the initiation complex at the HPV origin (25).\nOur results from DpnI replication assays show that a point\nmutation of GC box 1 that ablated the formation of the two\ncomplexes observed in EMSAs also resulted in a two- to three-\nfold increase in replication ef\ufb01ciency compared to that ob-\nserved with the wild-type virus. These \ufb01ndings concerning the\n11730\nKHALIL ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nfunction of the Sp1/Sp3 binding site within the VZV oriS\nindicate that interaction of Sp1 and Sp3 with the wild-type GC\nbox 1 sequence results in a suppression of origin-dependent\nreplication. This is in direct contrast to the function of such\nsites in the EBV and HSV-1 origins and represents a novel\n\ufb01nding for VZV. These results also represent the \ufb01rst docu-\nmentation of a role for Sp3 in the VZV replication cycle. Since\nthese data were obtained using a plasmid containing only\nthe VZV oriS, it will, in the future, be important to correlate these\n\ufb01ndings with the infectious phenotype of viruses carrying the GC\nbox 1 mutation at the native sites within the VZV genome.\nThe role or roles played by YY1 in VZV infection are\nunknown; thus, the identi\ufb01cation of a bona \ufb01de YY1 binding\nsite within the oriS downstream region site afforded the po-\ntential to identify a VZV-speci\ufb01c function for this ubiquitous\ncellular factor. YY1 has been shown to be capable of direct\ninteraction with Sp1 (24, 45), raising the possibility that bridg-\ning could occur between Sp1 and YY1 bound at their respec-\ntive sites in the downstream region of the VZV oriS. Mutation\nof the YY1 site with concomitant loss of YY1 binding, how-\never, resulted in no statistically signi\ufb01cant effect, eliminating\nthe possibility that a potential Sp1/YY1 bridging interaction\nmight in\ufb02uence replication ef\ufb01ciency under our experimental\nconditions. This does not eliminate the possibility that YY1\nplays an important role in VZV infection. YY1 could in\ufb02uence\ncellular functions vital for VZV lytic replication or interact\nfunctionally with IE62 or other VZV transactivators, such as\nthe IE4 and ORF61 proteins (18, 34, 35) at speci\ufb01c viral pro-\nmoters. Alternatively, YY1 could in\ufb02uence origin-dependent\nDNA replication in primary cells or in speci\ufb01c tissues infected\nby VZV in the human host. As an example, YY1 has been\nshown to act as a negative regulator of the EBV BRLF1 pro-\nmoter in both HeLa and Raji cells, but the level of suppression\nwas much greater in HeLa cells (56).\nThe data gathered on the ability of Sp1 and Sp3 to bind to\nthe GC box 1 site in the downstream region of oriS and the\nincreased oriS-dependent replication ef\ufb01ciency observed with\nmutations that ablate that binding led to the following model\nfor the role of the GC box 1 sequence analyzed during the\ncourse of this work (Fig. 8). At times immediately after infec-\ntion, endogenous Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the GC box 1 site. Once\nsuf\ufb01cient IE62 is synthesized, the most active phase of viral\ngene expression ensues, and at this stage Sp1 and Sp3 exchange\noff this site and interact physically and functionally with the\nmajor VZV transactivator IE62 to ef\ufb01ciently express the viral\ngenome. Previous work by Peng et al. (39) showed that as\nmuch as 20 to 25% of total Sp1 is associated with IE62 in\nVZV-infected cells. Additional support for this possibility\ncomes from experiments showing that ectopic expression of\nSp1 and Sp3 but not YY1 enhance IE62-mediated transacti-\nvation in transient-transfection assays (data not shown). The\nresulting decrease of Sp1 and Sp3 at GC box 1 would, based on\nour data, allow an increase in origin-dependent DNA replica-\ntion. During the late phase of the VZV life cycle, IE62 is\nexcluded, to a large extent, from the nucleus (21, 22), and Sp1\nand Sp3 could potentially rebind to this site and aid in decreas-\ning DNA replication during this phase of infection.\nThis model has broader implications in terms of the multi-\nfaceted nature of VZV pathogenesis. Our data show that in\nMeWo cells, VZV infection reduces expression of the Sp4\nprotein to a modest but reproducible extent and that interac-\ntion of Sp4 with the GC box 1 element is less stable than that\nobserved with Sp1 and Sp3. As indicated above, Sp4 is primar-\nily and dominantly expressed in neuronal tissue and is capable\nof binding to the consensus Sp1 site, whereas Sp1 expression is\ndownregulated. Therefore, it is possible that, under certain\nconditions, Sp4 may be able to compete with and displace Sp1\nat the VZV GC box 1 site as has been reported in the case of\nFIG. 8. Model summarizing a possible mechanism of Sp1/Sp3-dependent modulation of VZV DNA origin-dependent replication during the\nVZV life cycle. In this model, Sp1 and Sp3 cycle on and off the consensus GGGCGGG site within GC box 1 in response to requirements for their\npresence for IE62-mediated transcription at promoter sites within the VZV genome. Thus, their presence during the early phase of the virus life\ncycle would be minimal, resulting in increased DNA replication which also peaks at this phase. IE, immediate early.\nVOL. 82, 2008\nCELLULAR FACTORS AND VZV DNA REPLICATION\n11731\n\nthe human ADH5/FDH promoter (23). If Sp4, like Sp1 en-\nhances IE62-mediated transactivation, the combination of nor-\nmally decreased expression of Sp1 in neurons and reduction of\nSp4 levels due to infection could lead to a reduction of VZV\ngene expression upon initial neuronal infection and a general\ncessation of viral replication. Alternatively, if Sp4 does not\nsynergize with IE62 but binds to the GC box 1 element, it\ncould, even at reduced levels and possibly in conjunction with\nneuronal factors, act to suppress VZV DNA replication. Both\nof these scenarios would likely increase the chances for a\nswitch from lytic to latent infection. Conversely, low levels of\nSp1 and decreased levels of Sp4 during reactivation could lead\nto increased ef\ufb01ciency of viral DNA replication. Thus, the\ncis-acting GC box 1 element within the downstream region of\nVZV oriS and the interplay of various levels of Sp1 and Sp4\ncould potentially be involved in the establishment and/or re-\nactivation of VZV latency.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by NIH grants AI18449 and AI36884.\nM.I.K. was supported in part by a scholarship from the Egyptian\nMinistry of Higher Education.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Ruyechan*\nDepartment of Microbiology and 1mmunology and Witebsky Center for Microbial Pathogenesis and 1mmunology,\nUniversity at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, New York 14214\nReceived 24 June 2008/Accepted 18 September 2008\nThe varicella-zoster virus (VZV) origin of DNA replication (oriS) contains a 46-bp AT-rich palindrome and\nthree consensus binding sites for the VZV origin binding protein (OBP) encoded by VZV ORF51. All three OBP\nbinding sites are upstream of the palindrome in contrast to the sequence of the herpes simplex virus oriS,\nwhich has required OBP binding sites upstream and downstream of the AT-rich region. We are investigating\nthe roles that sequences downstream of the palindrome play in VZV oriS-dependent DNA replication. Com-\nputer analysis identi\ufb01ed two GC boxes, GC box 1 and GC box 2, in the downstream region which were predicted\nto be binding sites for the cellular transcription factor Sp1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift\nassays showed that two members of the Sp family (Sp1 and Sp3) stably bind to GC box 1, but not to GC box\n2. A predicted binding site for the cellular factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) that overlaps with GC box 2 was also\nidenti\ufb01ed. Supershift and mutational analyses con\ufb01rmed the binding of YY1 to this site. Mutation of GC box\n1 resulted in loss of Sp1 and Sp3 binding and an increase in origin-dependent replication ef\ufb01ciency in DpnI\nreplication assays. 1n contrast, mutation of the YY1 site had a statistically insigni\ufb01cant effect. These results\nsuggest a model where origin-dependent DNA replication and viral transcription are coupled by the binding\nof Sp1 and Sp3 to the downstream region of the VZV replication origin during lytic infection. They may also\nhave implications regarding establishment or reactivation of viral latency.\nVaricella-zoster virus (VZV) is a member of the Alphaher-\npesvirus subfamily of the Herpesviridae family. VZV is the caus-\native agent of two types of disease, chicken pox (varicella)\nupon primary infection and shingles (zoster) after reactivation\nfrom latency (1, 2). The VZV genome consists of 125 kbp\nwhich encodes approximately 69 open reading frames (ORFs).\nThe viral genome is made up of long and short unique seg-\nments designated UL and US, respectively, both of which are\nbounded by inverted repeat sequences (11). The linear se-\nquence of VZV genes is similar to that of herpes simplex virus\ntype 1 (HSV-1) and includes the coding sequences for ortho-\nlogues of the seven HSV-1 proteins required for origin-depen-\ndent DNA replication (9).\nThe VZV genome contains two origins of DNA replication\n(oriS) within the internal repeats (IRs) and terminal repeats\n(TRs) bounding the US segment at sites analogous to those\nwithin the HSV-1 genome. VZV, however, lacks the third\nHSV-1 origin (oriL), which is located near the center of the\nHSV-1 UL region (10, 11, 48, 49). HSV-1 oriL has been shown\nto be dispensable for replication of HSV DNA (3, 53) but has\nbeen implicated in HSV pathogenesis and reactivation from\nlatency (4). The equivalent region in the VZV genome is\ncomprised of a bidirectional promoter that regulates the tran-\nscription of the VZV DNA polymerase catalytic subunit\n(ORF28) and DNA binding protein (ORF29) genes (32, 54).\nThe architecture of the VZV and HSV-1 oriS regions differs\nsigni\ufb01cantly (Fig. 1). The two VZV oriS regions contain an\nAT-rich palindrome and three consensus 10-bp binding sites\n[5\u0002-C(G/A)TTCGCACT-3\u0002] for the VZV origin binding pro-\ntein (OBP) encoded by VZV ORF51 located upstream of the\nAT-rich palindrome (48, 50). These binding sites, designated\nboxes A, B, and C are identical or nearly identical to the\nconsensus site for the HSV-1 UL9 OBP with which the VZV\nORF51 OBP shares 54.8% similarity and 46.5% identity (8,\n50). All three OBP binding sites in the VZV origin are ori-\nented in the same direction and are present on the same strand\nof the viral DNA. Origin-dependent DNA replication in VZV\nrequires the AT-rich region and box A. Box C is not essential,\nbut its presence increases replication ef\ufb01ciency, while box B\nappears to be completely dispensable (48, 50). Nothing is cur-\nrently known regarding the role played by sequences down-\nstream of the VZV minimal origin in viral DNA replication. A\npartial (7 of 10 bp) OBP binding site is present downstream of\nthe AT-rich palindrome with the same orientation and on the\nsame strand as the upstream OBP boxes. However, gel shift\nand DNase 1 protection assays failed to demonstrate VZV\nOBP binding to this sequence (8, 50). 1n contrast, in the HSV-1\noriS, binding sites for the UL9 OBP (boxes 1, 1I, and 1II) occur\nboth upstream and downstream of the AT-rich region. Boxes 1\nand 1I are located upstream and downstream on opposite\nstrands of the DNA and are oriented in opposite directions.\nBox 1II is located upstream of box 1 but is oriented in the same\ndirection and occurs on the same DNA strand as box 1I. Mu-\ntational analysis has shown that the minimal HSV-1 requires\nthe presence of both box 1 and box 1I and the central AT-rich\nregion (4, 12, 49, 52).\nThe structural differences between the VZV and HSV-1 oriS\nin terms of the positioning and orientation of the OBP binding\nsites suggest that the mechanism and/or transacting factors\n* Corresponding author.

One possi-\nbility raised by Stow et al. (50) is that cellular factors or as yet\nunidenti\ufb01ed viral proteins could bind downstream of the AT-\nrich region in the VZV oriS to facilitate unwinding of the\norigin and assembly of the viral DNA replication machinery.\nThere is precedence for this possibility based on work with\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV), HSV-1, simian virus 40 (SV40), and\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV). The cellular transcription factor\nSp1 binds to the downstream region of EBV ORILyt and phys-\nically interacts with the EBV DNA polymerase catalytic and\naccessory subunits, increasing their recruitment and resulting\nin a positive effect on DNA replication (5, 15). Sp1 and the\nrelated factor Sp3 bind to the upstream region of the HSV-1\noriS at a cis element, designated OscarL, and also have a\npositive effect on origin-dependent DNA replication, although\nthe speci\ufb01c mechanism remains unknown (37). Several tran-\nscription factors were found to stimulate SV40 DNA replica-\ntion, including NF1, AP1, and Sp1 (16). Sp1 has also been\nreported (13) to enhance replication of human papillomavirus\ntype 18 (HPV18). 1n contrast, the transcription factor Yin\nYang 1 (YY1) has been shown to suppress HPV DNA repli-\ncation through interference with the function of the HPV E2\nprotein (25). 1n the work presented here, we identi\ufb01ed and authenticated\nthe presence of binding sites for cellular transcription factors\nwithin the downstream region of the VZV oriS and tested the\neffects of mutations of those sequences on VZV origin-depen-\ndent replication. Our data show that the cellular factors Sp1,\nSp3, and YY1 stably bind to different portions of the down-\nstream region of the VZV oriS. YY1 appears to have no effect\non origin-dependent replication. However, mutation of the\nSp1/Sp3 site that ablates binding of these factors resulted in an\nincrease in replication in in situ DpnI replication assays. This\nindicates that Sp1 and Sp3 act to suppress VZV oriS-depen-\ndent replication in contrast to what has been observed, as\ndescribed above, in other virus systems. Further, this repre-\nsents the \ufb01rst documentation of a role for Sp3 in VZV infec-\ntion.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCells and viruses. MeWo cells, a human melanoma cell line that supports the\nreplication of VZV, were grown in Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium supple-\nmented with 10% fetal bovine serum as previously described (47). VZV strain\nMSP was propagated in MeWo cell monolayers as described by Lynch et al. (29)\nand Peng et al. (39).\nNuclear and whole-cell lysates. Nuclear extracts of VZV-infected and unin-\nfected MeWo cells were prepared as previously described (29). Brie\ufb02y, pelleted\ncells were washed once with 30 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. Packed\ncells were resuspended in one packed cell volume of buffer A (10 mM HEPES\n[pH 7.9], 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) at 4\u00b0C and allowed\nto swell on ice for 15 min. Cells were then lysed by 10 rapid passages through a\n25-gauge hypodermic syringe, and the homogenate was sedimented brie\ufb02y at\n12,000 \u0003 g. The crude nuclear pellet was resuspended in two-thirds of one\npacked cell volume (determined at the time of cell harvest) of buffer C (20 mM\nHEPES [pH 7.9], 25% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM\nEDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \ufb02uoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol), and the\nresulting solution was incubated on ice with stirring for 30 min. The nuclear\ndebris was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 \u0003 g, and the supernatant\n(nuclear extract) was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 20%\n[vol/vol] glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl\n\ufb02uoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) for 2 h. The dialyzed extract was then quick-\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u000470\u00b0C. Whole-cell lysates of VZV-\ninfected and uninfected MeWo cells were prepared as previously described (39).\nCells were grown to con\ufb02uence in 100-mm petri dishes, washed with phosphate-\nbuffered saline buffer, and then suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH\n7.5], 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor\ncocktail [Roche, Mamheim, Germany] added per the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntion). The lysates were collected and centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatants\nwere stored at \u000470\u00b0C for subsequent use. 1mmunoblot analyses. Whole-cell lysates of VZV-infected and uninfected\nMeWo cells were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-10% polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis and immunoblotting for the presence of Sp family members and\nYY1 as described by Yang et al. (55). Antibodies against Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Sp4, and\n\u0005-tubulin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).\nAntibody against Sp1 was also obtained from Upstate (Temecula, CA). Rabbit\npolyclonal antibody against YY1 was generously supplied by Te-Chung Lee\n(University at Buffalo). Reactive bands were visualized using goat anti-rabbit\nFIG. 1.

Quanti\ufb01cation of the relative amounts of these\ntranscription factors normalized to \u0005-tubulin in loading controls was performed\nusing a Bio-Rad GS700 imagining densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Sta-\ntistical signi\ufb01cance was determined by a one-way analysis of variance, followed by\nTukey\u2019s post hoc test.\nPlasmids. The pVO2 plasmid containing a 259-bp fragment encompassing\nnucleotides 5502 to 5760 of the TRs/IRs sequence of the VZV Dumas strain (10)\nwas generously supplied by Nigel Stow (MRC Virology Unit, 1nstitute of Virol-\nogy, University of Glasgow). This fragment contains the VZV oriS region in-\ncluding OBP boxes C and A, the AT-rich palindrome, and 125 bp of downstream\nsequence. The pVO2 parental plasmid, pAT153, was purchased from MoBiTec\n(Goettingen, Germany).\nPlasmids containing GC box 1 and YY1 and box A substitution mutations\nwithin the oriS region were generated by mutation of pVO2 using the\nQuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the\nfollowing primer sets: primers 5\u0002-ATGTCGCGGTTTTATGGGGTGTTCGCG\nGGCTTTTCACAGAATATA-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-TATATTCTGTGAAAAGCCCGCG\nAACACCCCATAAAACCGCGACAT-3\u0002 for GC box 1, primers 5\u0002-ACAGAA\nTATATATATTCCAAATTTAGCGGCAGGCTTTTTAAAATC-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-G\nATTTTAAAAAGCCTGCCGCTAAATTTGGAATATATATATTCTGT-3\u0002\nfor YY1, and primers 5\u0002-GGCATGTGTCCAACCACCGTTAAAACTTTCTT\nTCTATATATATAT-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-ATATATATATAGAAAGAAAGTTTTAACG\nGTGGTTGGACACATGCC-3\u0002 for box A. All primers were synthesized by 1DT\n(Coralville, 1A). The positions and sequences of the mutations in the VZV oriS\nsequence contained within the pVO2 plasmid used in transfections were veri\ufb01ed\nby sequencing at the Roswell Park sequencing facility.\nDpnI replication assays. MeWo cells were transfected with Lipofectamine\nreagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nFour microliters of Lipofectamine reagent was used per microgram of trans-\nfected DNA in each transfection. 1n transfections performed in 100-mm-diam-\neter petri dishes, 2.1 \u0003 106 MeWo cells per dish were seeded in 12 ml of\ncomplete growth medium. The cells were 80% con\ufb02uent at the time of transfec-\ntion. Three hours before transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh\nmedium. Replication experiments were performed as described by Stow and\nMcMonagle (49) and Stow and Davison (48). The cells were transfected with 5\n\u0006g of wild-type or mutant pVO2 plasmids. At 6 h posttransfection, cells were\nsuperinfected with VZV strain MSP. VZV superinfections were performed by\nadding a ratio of 0.4 infected cell per 1 uninfected cell of the infected cells to\neach monolayer. Total cellular DNA was prepared 48 h after superinfection by\nthe addition of 5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 0.5%\nsodium dodecyl sulfate, 20 \u0006g/ml RNase 1) per dish. Lysates were transferred to\n15-ml conical test tubes and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Proteinase K in TE buffer\n(10 mM Tris-HCl and 0.001 M EDTA) was added to a \ufb01nal concentration of 100\n\u0006g per ml, and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 0.15 M. The mixture was\nthen incubated at 50\u00b0C for 3 h. The DNA was isolated by phenol chloroform\nextraction, followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was digested with DpnI\nand EcoRI as described by Stow and Davison (48) and analyzed by Southern blot\nhybridization. Transfers were done using TurboBlotter kits obtained from What-\nman, 1nc. (Sanford, ME). The blots were probed with a 400-bp PCR product\nprepared from pVO2 using primers 5\u0002-GTGCTCCTGTCGTTGAGGACCCG\nG-3\u0002 and 5\u0002-CCTCTGACTTGAGCGTCGATTTTT-3\u0002 and end labeled with[\u0007-\n32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This fragment includes a\nportion (nucleotide positions 1465 to 1864) of the pVO2 plasmid containing the\nColE1 origin of replication and was designed to detect both intact DpnI-resistant\nlinearized pVO2 (3.9 kb) resulting from replication of the input plasmid and an\n872-bp fragment resulting from the DpnI-sensitive unreplicated input plasmid.\nThe resulting bands were quanti\ufb01ed by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics,\nSumyvale, CA) analysis. The ratio of replicated plasmid to input plasmid rep-\nresented the replication ef\ufb01ciency of the test plasmid. The data from represen-\ntative experiments are presented as means of triplicate DpnI replications. Error\nbars indicate standard errors. Statistical signi\ufb01cance was determined by a one-\nway analysis of variance followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test.\nEMSA and supershift analyses. Thirty-base-pair oligonucleotide probes (IDT,\nCoralville, 1A) containing wild-type and mutant GC box 1 elements and 40-bp\nprobes containing wild-type and mutant YY1 and GC box 2 binding site elements\nwere used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Probes were end\nlabeled with [\u0007-32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For the GC\nbox 1 probes, 100 femtomoles of the 30-bp labeled probes containing wild-type\nand mutant GC box 1 (\b1 \u0003 105 dpm) were incubated with 12 \u0006g of uninfected\nor infected MeWo cell nuclear extract in a 10-\u0006l reaction mixture in binding\nbuffer A [40 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 \u0006g/ml\nbovine serum albumin, 12% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 3\n\u0006g poly(dI-dC)]. For the GC box 2/YY1 probes, 100 femtomoles of 40-bp labeled\nprobes containing wild-type and mutant GC box 2 sequences or wild-type and\nmutant YY1 binding sites (\b1 \u0003 105 dpm) were incubated with 12 \u0006g of MeWo\ncell nuclear extracts in a 10-\u0006l reaction mixture in binding buffer B [10 mM\nTris-HCl (pH 8.0), l mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 3 \u0006g poly(dI-dC), 0.1% NP-40,\n1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 \u0006g/ml bovine serum albumin]. The samples were\nanalyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacryl-\namide) gel and then autoradiography. 1n the supershift assays, anti-Sp family antibodies (antibodies against the four\nmembers of the Sp family [Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4]) obtained from Santa Cruz\nBiologicals (Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-Sp1 antibodies (Upstate, Temecula, CA)\nand rabbit polyclonal YY1 antiserum, generously supplied by Te-Chung Lee\n(University at Buffalo) were added in 4-\u0006g (Sp family) or 2-\u0006l (YY1) aliquots to\nreaction mixtures containing infected cell nuclear extracts and either GC box 1\nor YY1/GC box 2 probes. All of the antibodies directed against the Sp family\nmembers were described by the commercial suppliers as being positive in super-\nshift assays. This was con\ufb01rmed in control experiments using consensus GC\nbox-containing duplex probes (data not shown). The samples were then analyzed\nby electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel\nand autoradiography.\nRESULTS 1denti\ufb01cation of potential binding sites for cellular factors\nin the downstream region of VZV oriS. The 125 bp immedi-\nately downstream of the AT-rich palindrome of the VZV\noriS, located within the 1Rs region of the genome, were\nanalyzed for the presence of cellular transcription factor\nbinding sites using the AliBaba2.1 and Patch programs (http:\n//www.gene-regulation.com/pub/programs.html; Biobase). Two\nGC-rich sequences, designated GC box 1 and GC box 2, were\nidenti\ufb01ed 57 to 72 bp and 99 to 110 bp, respectively, 3\u0002 to the\n\ufb01nal TA pair in the minimal origin (Fig. 1B). Both contained\npredicted binding sites for the ubiquitous cellular transcription\nfactor Sp1. GC box 1 contains the canonical Sp1 binding\nsequence (5\u0002-GGGCGGG-3\u0002) \ufb01rst identi\ufb01ed by Dynan and\nTjian (14) in the SV40 early promoter. GC box 2 contains an\nalternative site (5\u0002-GGAGCGG-3\u0002) predicted to bind Sp1. Sp1\nis well documented to be involved in VZV replication based on\nstudies describing its role in several important VZV promot-\ners, including those regulating expression of VZV gI, gE, the\nVZV major single-strand binding protein, and the VZV DNA\npolymerase catalytic subunit (6, 19, 39, 43, 54). Sp1 has also\nbeen shown to interact physically and functionally with the\nVZV major transcriptional activator, 1E62 (36, 39). 1n addi-\ntion, there is a high incidence of predicted Sp1 binding sites\nwithin VZV promoters (a minimum of 18) beyond those al-\nready authenticated (44).\nA potential binding site (5\u0002-CAAATGGAG-3\u0002) for the cel-\nlular transcription factor YY1 was also identi\ufb01ed partially\noverlapping GC box 2. This sequence is highly homologous to\na YY1 site identi\ufb01ed in the HPV8 E6 promoter (5\u0002-CAAAT\nGGAC-3\u0002) and is also very similar to YY1 sites identi\ufb01ed in\nadeno-associated virus P5 promoter and the murine leukemia\nvirus long terminal repeat (26, 38). YY1 can act either as an\nactivator or a repressor and has been shown to be capable of\ninteracting with Sp1 (24, 45, 46). 1n contrast to Sp1, the role or\nroles that YY1 plays in VZV transcription and the viral life\ncycle are currently unknown. Based on the results from the\ncomputer analysis, EMSA, supershift, and mutational analyses\nwere then performed in order to determine whether GC box 1,\nGC box 2, and the YY1 site were bona \ufb01de binding targets for\nthe speci\ufb01c transcription factors.\nVOL. 82, 2008\nCELLULAR FACTORS AND VZV DNA REPLICATION\n11725\n\nSp1 and Sp3 bind to GC box 1. 1n the \ufb01rst series of exper-\niments, EMSAs were performed using a 30-bp duplex oligo-\nnucleotide containing the 15-bp GC box 1 and upstream and\ndownstream \ufb02anking sequences (Fig. 2A). Shift patterns were\nobtained using uninfected and VZV-infected MeWo cell nu-\nclear extracts. Two complexes, one major and one minor, were\nconsistently observed with both infected and uninfected nu-\nclear extracts, with the major complex being the slower migrat-\ning of the two (Fig. 2B). There was no difference in the shift\npattern, qualitatively or quantitatively, obtained with the two\nnuclear extracts, suggesting that viral proteins and/or cellular\nproteins whose expression or DNA binding properties were\nsigni\ufb01cantly modi\ufb01ed by VZV infection did not play a role in\nthe formation of the observed complexes. To test the speci\ufb01city\nof the formation of these two complexes, competition EMSA\nexperiments were performed using the unlabeled 30-bp GC\nbox 1 probe as the speci\ufb01c competitor and a 30-bp oligonucle-\notide containing the OBP box A sequence as the nonspeci\ufb01c\ncompetitor. As shown in Fig. 2C, the cold speci\ufb01c competitor\nef\ufb01ciently competed away the formation of the two complexes,\nwhile the presence of the nonspeci\ufb01c competitor had no effect\non the pattern of the shifted bands. 1n the next series of experiments, EMSAs were performed\nusing oligonucleotides containing mutations in the consensus\nSp1 binding site in the GC box 1 sequence. These included\ndeletion of the 7-base-pair Sp1 binding site and site-speci\ufb01c\nmutagenesis which substituted the \ufb01rst two G residues with T\nand C, respectively (Fig. 3A). Both of these mutations were\npredicted to abolish Sp1 binding using the same computer\nanalysis that had initially identi\ufb01ed the site. As shown in Fig.\n3B, both the deletion and substitution mutations ablated for-\nmation of both of the complexes formed with the wild-type\nsequence.\nAntibody supershift assays were then performed in order to\ncon\ufb01rm that Sp1 was, in fact, present in the observed com-\nplexes and to investigate whether any of the other three major\nmembers of the Sp family of transcription factors (Sp2, Sp3,\nand Sp4), all of which are capable of binding to GC-rich se-\nquences (17, 42), were also present. The results are presented\nin Fig. 3C and show that a signi\ufb01cant fraction of the major,\nslower-migrating complex was supershifted only in the pres-\nence of anti-Sp1 antibody. Two anti-Sp1-speci\ufb01c supershifted\ncomplexes were consistently observed in these experiments.\nOne migrated slightly more slowly than the major complex did,\nand the second, representing the majority of the supershifted\nmaterial, failed to enter the gel. The less-abundant faster-\nmigrating complex was completely supershifted only in the\npresence of anti-Sp3 antibody. 1n the data presented in Fig. 3C,\na small amount of material failed to enter the gel in the pres-\nence of anti-Sp4 antibody. This occurred in three of \ufb01ve sep-\narate EMSA experiments, whereas the shifts observed with the\nSp1 and Sp3 antibodies occurred in all \ufb01ve experiments. 1n\ncontrast, no supershifts or losses of complexes were observed\nin the presence of anti-Sp2 antibodies.

Sp3\nappears to be present exclusively in the complex represented\nby the less-abundant, faster-migrating band. Sp4 may also be\nassociated with GC box 1 but to a much lower and less stable\nextent than Sp1 and Sp3 under these experimental conditions.\nYY1 binds to the predicted YY1 binding site. 1n the next\nseries of experiments, we wished to determine whether protein\ncomplexes were formed with duplex oligonucleotides contain-\ning GC box 2 sequence and the predicted overlapping YY1\nbinding site. EMSAs were performed using a 40-bp probe\ncontaining both sequences and 8-bp upstream and 15-bp down-\nstream \ufb02anking sequences (Fig. 4A). Shifts were performed\nwith both uninfected and infected MeWo cell extracts. Three\nmajor complexes were formed in the presence of both unin-\nfected and infected cell nuclear extracts and displayed identical\nmigration positions (Fig. 4B). A decrease in the level of the\nintermediate migrating complex with infected protein extracts\ncompared to uninfected protein extracts was frequently ob-\nserved in these experiments, suggesting that this complex is less\nstable in the case of the infected cell extracts.\nWe next wished to determine whether any of the Sp family\nmembers or YY1 bound to this sequence. Supershift experi-\nments with antibodies against Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 indicated\nthat, in contrast to our results with GC box 1, none of these\nfactors bound to the probe containing GC box 2 (data not\nshown). Supershifts with anti-YY1, however, consistently re-\nsulted in loss of the fastest-migrating band in the case of the\nwild-type sequence and with probes containing deletion and\nsubstitution mutations predicted to disrupt the binding of Sp1\n(Fig. 5). 1n each of these cases, signal was present in the well,\nFIG. 3.

Finally, site-speci\ufb01c mutation of the YY1 site led to loss of\nthe fastest-migrating band, and here, no signal was seen in the\nwell in the presence of anti-YY1 antibody.\nThus, our results show that YY1 binds to the predicted YY1\nbinding site, whereas there is no evidence either by supershift\nassays or by mutational analysis that any members of the Sp\nfamily bind to this portion of the downstream region of VZV\noriS. The site-speci\ufb01c and deletion mutations narrow the YY1\nsite to 5\u0002-CCAAATGG-3\u0002 and indicate that the two 3\u0002-termi-\nnal guanine residues are critical for YY1 binding. The persis-\ntence of the two slower-migrating bands suggests that their\nformation involves the \ufb02anking regions, rather than the core\nelements mutated. This was con\ufb01rmed in competition experi-\nments where the cold 40-bp probe successfully competed away\nall three complexes (data not shown).\nVZV infection lowers the level of Sp4 present in MeWo cells.\nWe next examined the levels of Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 and\nYY1 present in uninfected and infected whole-cell extracts by\nimmunoblotting. Our results (Fig. 6) show that all four Sp\nfamily members and YY1 are expressed in MeWo cells. Quan-\nti\ufb01cation of the relative amounts of these factors using three\nsets of paired uninfected and infected cell extract preparations\nshowed that there was no statistically signi\ufb01cant difference in\nthe levels of Sp1 (P \t 0.373), Sp2 (P \t 0.254), Sp3 (P \t 0.563),\nand YY1 (P \t 0.373) in infected versus uninfected MeWo cell\nextracts. Also, infection did not alter the levels of the two\nshorter forms of Sp3 of very similar molecular weights that are\ngenerated via internal translation initiation start sites (20). 1n\ncontrast, a highly signi\ufb01cant (P \t 0.002) 40 to 50% decrease in\nthe level of Sp4 in infected versus uninfected cell extracts was\nobserved.\nMutation of the Sp1/Sp3 site results in an increase in origin-\ndependent DNA replication.

VIROL.\n\nfor Sp1 and Sp3 resulted in an increase in origin-dependent\nDNA replication in DpnI resistance replication assays using a\nplasmid containing the HSV oriS. Analogous experiments\nwere performed in the work reported here in order to deter-\nmine the effects of mutation of the Sp1/Sp3 site in GC box 1\nand the downstream YY1 site. These experiments were per-\nformed by transfection of the pVO2 plasmid (48, 50) contain-\ning the VZV oriS sequence (OBP boxes C and A, the AT-rich\npalindrome, and the 125-bp downstream region) into MeWo\ncells followed by VZV superinfection at a ratio of 0.4/1 in-\nfected to uninfected cells. The cells were harvested 48 h after\nsuperinfection, and the state of the oriS-containing plasmid\nDNA was analyzed by DpnI digestion, followed by separation\non agarose gels and Southern blot hybridization. Blots were\nprobed with a 400-bp pVO2 fragment that allowed clear dif-\nferentiation between replicated (unmethylated, DpnI-resis-\ntant) progeny DNA and unreplicated (methylated DpnI-sensi-\ntive) input plasmids.\nControl DpnI replication assays using pVO2 containing the\nwild-type VZV oriS showed a clear and readily detectable\nsignal at the position predicted for the replicated DNA (Fig.\n7A). 1n contrast, assays performed under the same conditions\nusing the parent pAT153 plasmid lacking the VZV oriS re-\nsulted in no signal at the position of the replicated DNA. For\na second negative control, pVO2 containing a three-base sub-\nstitution in the box A OBP binding site was used. This also\nresulted in a loss of the replicated DNA band in agreement\nwith the results of Stow et al. (50) who showed via deletion that\nbox A is required for oriS-dependent DNA replication. 1ndi-\nvidual point mutations at the CGC positions were shown by\nChen and Olivo (8) to eliminate OBP binding. Thus, these data\ncon\ufb01rm the long-held supposition that OBP binding to box A\nis required for VZV oriS-dependent DNA replication even in\nthe presence of box C. 1n the next series of experiments, triplicate DpnI assays were\nperformed using wild-type pVO2 and pVO2 plasmids contain-\ning the site-speci\ufb01c mutations within GC box 1 and the YY1\nsite which ablated Sp1/Sp3 and YY1 binding, respectively. As\nshown in Fig. 7B and C, mutation of GC box 1 increased the\nlevel of origin-dependent replication two- to threefold, and this\ndifference was statistically signi\ufb01cant (P \t 0.035). 1n contrast,\nthe YY1 substitution mutation had no statistically signi\ufb01cant\neffect (P \t 0.162) on the ef\ufb01ciency of origin-dependent repli-\ncation under these conditions.

This replication origin desig-\nnated oriS, is present within the inverted repeat sequences\nsurrounding the unique short (US) region of the VZV genome.\nThe structure of the VZV oriS is distinctly different from that\nof the oriS of HSV-1. While both contain an AT-rich palin-\ndrome 45 to 46 bp in length, the arrangement of binding sites\nfor the HSV and VZV OBPs differs signi\ufb01cantly. Speci\ufb01cally,\nthe HSV oriS contains experimentally veri\ufb01ed OBP binding\nsites oriented in opposite directions upstream and downstream\nof the AT-rich region (12, 49, 52, 53). 1n contrast, the three\nexperimentally veri\ufb01ed OBP binding sites within the VZV oriS\nare all located upstream of the AT-rich palindrome (8, 50).\nFurthermore, Stow and Davison (48) showed that a plasmid\ncontaining only the proximal OBP binding site, the AT-rich\npalindrome, and 125 bp of sequence downstream from the\nAT-rich sequence were suf\ufb01cient for origin-dependent replica-\ntion in DpnI replication assays.\nOur results show that the cellular transcription factors Sp1\nand Sp3 and possibly Sp4 interact with a GC-rich site (GC box\n1) downstream of the AT-rich palindrome. This is true despite\nthe fact that all four Sp family members are expressed in\nMeWo cells. Two complexes reproducibly formed with GC box\n1 were identi\ufb01ed by EMSA analysis and antibody supershifts,\nwith one being speci\ufb01c for Sp1 and the other speci\ufb01c for Sp3.\nPartial deletion and site-speci\ufb01c mutation of the GC box 1\nabolished formation of both complexes, providing further\nproof of speci\ufb01c binding. No difference in complex formation\nwas observed using infected and uninfected cell extracts, sug-\ngesting that upon infection, no additional viral or cellular pro-\nteins were recruited to these complexes. Sp1 and Sp3 belong to\nthe growing family of Sp/XKLF cellular transcription factors of\nwhich Sp1 is the prototype. Some 23 members of this family\nhave been identi\ufb01ed in the human genome based on the pres-\nence of a combination of three conserved Cys2His2 zinc \ufb01ngers\nthat form a DNA recognition motif (7). However, only Sp1,\nSp2, Sp3, and Sp4 have been extensively characterized as to\ntheir tissue speci\ufb01city and role(s) in transcription (7, 28, 42).\nSp1 through Sp4 all show a modular structure with activation\nand, in some cases inhibitory, domains present in their N-\nterminal regions and the characteristic set of zinc \ufb01ngers\npresent near their C termini. This similar modular structure\nhas resulted in their being designated a subgroup of the larger\nSp/XKLF family (7). Sp1 and Sp3 are believed to be ubiqui-\ntously expressed in all tissues, and both are capable of activat-\ning expression of mammalian genes via recognition of GC- and\nGT-rich motifs (28, 42). However, the interplay between Sp1\nand Sp3 is complex, with Sp3 sometimes acting as a repressor\nof Sp1 (28, 30). Sp2 lacks one of the N-terminal activation\ndomains and binds to a site different from that of Sp1, Sp3, and\nSp4 (33, 42). Sp2 is generally associated with repression of\ngenes activated by the other three members of the major Sp\nsubfamily. Expression of Sp4 has been detected in several cell\nlines (17, 23). However, in mammals, Sp4 is predominantly\nexpressed in tissues of neuronal origin, while the expression\nand activity of Sp1 in those tissues are downregulated (27,\n31, 57).\nSp1/Sp3 sites have been identi\ufb01ed in the replication origins\nof several DNA viruses, including HPV, SV40, EBV, and\nHSV-1 (5, 13, 15, 16, 24, 25, 37). The presence of the Sp1/Sp3\nsites has been associated with an enhancement of origin-de-\npendent DNA replication. Deletion or mutation of consensus\nGC boxes within the HPV and SV40 genomes resulted in\ndecreases in DNA replication ef\ufb01ciency. The mechanism of\nhow Sp1 enhances replication in these cases is unknown. How-\never, at least for the case of SV40, the Sp1 site in question does\nnot appear to be involved in transcription of the viral genome\n(13, 16). Sp1 and possibly other Sp family members also in\ufb02u-\nence origin-dependent EBV DNA replication at the cis-acting\nelement oriLyt (5, 15). This element consists of two essential\ndomains designated the upstream and downstream compo-\nnents. The upstream component contains DNA binding motifs\nfor the EBV transcriptional activator BZLF1. The downstream\ncomponent is known to be the binding site of cellular tran-\nscription factors ZBP-89 and Sp1, which stimulate DNA rep-\nlication. This stimulation is believed to result from the recruit-\nment of viral DNA replication proteins, since direct interaction\nof Sp1 and ZBP-89 with the viral DNA polymerase and its\nprocessivity factor was demonstrated in protein binding assays\n(5). The HSV-1 genome contains two oriS core-adjacent reg-\nulatory (Oscar) elements, OscarL and OscarR, at the base of\nthe oriS palindrome. Mutation of either element reduced oriS-\ndependent DNA replication by 60 to 70%, and disruption of\nboth elements reduced replication by 90%. OscarL contains a\nconsensus binding site for the transcription factor Sp1. EMSA\nand supershift experiments using antibodies directed against\nthe Sp family members of transcription factors demonstrated\nthe presence of Sp1 and Sp3, but not Sp2 or Sp4, in the\nprotein-DNA complexes formed at OscarL (37). 1n contrast to our results with GC box 1, we found no\nevidence of interaction of any of the Sp family members with\nthe second GC-rich sequence (GC box 2), which was also\nthought to be a possible Sp1 binding site. 1nstead, the cellular\nfactor YY1 was found to bind to a predicted site overlapping\nGC box 2. These results represents the \ufb01rst experimentally\nveri\ufb01ed occurrence of YY1 binding to a VZV DNA sequence.\nYY1 is a 414-amino-acid zinc \ufb01nger protein that is capable of\nboth repression and activation of cellular genes and transcrip-\ntion in several virus systems, including adeno-associated virus,\nHPV, parvovirus B19, HSV-1, and murine leukemia virus (26,\n46). YY1 has been shown to repress HPV ori-dependent DNA\nreplication in a cell-free replication system. This repression,\nhowever, does not require the presence of a YY1 consensus\nbinding site or interaction of YY1 with HPV DNA. Rather, the\nYY1-mediated repression of HPV DNA replication is believed\nto be due to direct interaction between YY1 and the HPV E2\nprotein, a transcription factor that plays important roles in the\nassembly of the initiation complex at the HPV origin (25).\nOur results from DpnI replication assays show that a point\nmutation of GC box 1 that ablated the formation of the two\ncomplexes observed in EMSAs also resulted in a two- to three-\nfold increase in replication ef\ufb01ciency compared to that ob-\nserved with the wild-type virus. These \ufb01ndings concerning the\n11730\nKHALIL ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nfunction of the Sp1/Sp3 binding site within the VZV oriS\nindicate that interaction of Sp1 and Sp3 with the wild-type GC\nbox 1 sequence results in a suppression of origin-dependent\nreplication. This is in direct contrast to the function of such\nsites in the EBV and HSV-1 origins and represents a novel\n\ufb01nding for VZV. These results also represent the \ufb01rst docu-\nmentation of a role for Sp3 in the VZV replication cycle. Since\nthese data were obtained using a plasmid containing only\nthe VZV oriS, it will, in the future, be important to correlate these\n\ufb01ndings with the infectious phenotype of viruses carrying the GC\nbox 1 mutation at the native sites within the VZV genome.\nThe role or roles played by YY1 in VZV infection are\nunknown; thus, the identi\ufb01cation of a bona \ufb01de YY1 binding\nsite within the oriS downstream region site afforded the po-\ntential to identify a VZV-speci\ufb01c function for this ubiquitous\ncellular factor. YY1 has been shown to be capable of direct\ninteraction with Sp1 (24, 45), raising the possibility that bridg-\ning could occur between Sp1 and YY1 bound at their respec-\ntive sites in the downstream region of the VZV oriS. Mutation\nof the YY1 site with concomitant loss of YY1 binding, how-\never, resulted in no statistically signi\ufb01cant effect, eliminating\nthe possibility that a potential Sp1/YY1 bridging interaction\nmight in\ufb02uence replication ef\ufb01ciency under our experimental\nconditions. This does not eliminate the possibility that YY1\nplays an important role in VZV infection. YY1 could in\ufb02uence\ncellular functions vital for VZV lytic replication or interact\nfunctionally with 1E62 or other VZV transactivators, such as\nthe 1E4 and ORF61 proteins (18, 34, 35) at speci\ufb01c viral pro-\nmoters. Alternatively, YY1 could in\ufb02uence origin-dependent\nDNA replication in primary cells or in speci\ufb01c tissues infected\nby VZV in the human host. As an example, YY1 has been\nshown to act as a negative regulator of the EBV BRLF1 pro-\nmoter in both HeLa and Raji cells, but the level of suppression\nwas much greater in HeLa cells (56).\nThe data gathered on the ability of Sp1 and Sp3 to bind to\nthe GC box 1 site in the downstream region of oriS and the\nincreased oriS-dependent replication ef\ufb01ciency observed with\nmutations that ablate that binding led to the following model\nfor the role of the GC box 1 sequence analyzed during the\ncourse of this work (Fig. 8). At times immediately after infec-\ntion, endogenous Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the GC box 1 site. Once\nsuf\ufb01cient 1E62 is synthesized, the most active phase of viral\ngene expression ensues, and at this stage Sp1 and Sp3 exchange\noff this site and interact physically and functionally with the\nmajor VZV transactivator 1E62 to ef\ufb01ciently express the viral\ngenome. Previous work by Peng et al. (39) showed that as\nmuch as 20 to 25% of total Sp1 is associated with 1E62 in\nVZV-infected cells. Additional support for this possibility\ncomes from experiments showing that ectopic expression of\nSp1 and Sp3 but not YY1 enhance 1E62-mediated transacti-\nvation in transient-transfection assays (data not shown). The\nresulting decrease of Sp1 and Sp3 at GC box 1 would, based on\nour data, allow an increase in origin-dependent DNA replica-\ntion. During the late phase of the VZV life cycle, 1E62 is\nexcluded, to a large extent, from the nucleus (21, 22), and Sp1\nand Sp3 could potentially rebind to this site and aid in decreas-\ning DNA replication during this phase of infection.\nThis model has broader implications in terms of the multi-\nfaceted nature of VZV pathogenesis. Our data show that in\nMeWo cells, VZV infection reduces expression of the Sp4\nprotein to a modest but reproducible extent and that interac-\ntion of Sp4 with the GC box 1 element is less stable than that\nobserved with Sp1 and Sp3. As indicated above, Sp4 is primar-\nily and dominantly expressed in neuronal tissue and is capable\nof binding to the consensus Sp1 site, whereas Sp1 expression is\ndownregulated. Therefore, it is possible that, under certain\nconditions, Sp4 may be able to compete with and displace Sp1\nat the VZV GC box 1 site as has been reported in the case of\nFIG. 8. Model summarizing a possible mechanism of Sp1/Sp3-dependent modulation of VZV DNA origin-dependent replication during the\nVZV life cycle. 1n this model, Sp1 and Sp3 cycle on and off the consensus GGGCGGG site within GC box 1 in response to requirements for their\npresence for 1E62-mediated transcription at promoter sites within the VZV genome. Thus, their presence during the early phase of the virus life\ncycle would be minimal, resulting in increased DNA replication which also peaks at this phase. 1E, immediate early.\nVOL. 82, 2008\nCELLULAR FACTORS AND VZV DNA REPLICATION\n11731\n\nthe human ADH5/FDH promoter (23). 1f Sp4, like Sp1 en-\nhances 1E62-mediated transactivation, the combination of nor-\nmally decreased expression of Sp1 in neurons and reduction of\nSp4 levels due to infection could lead to a reduction of VZV\ngene expression upon initial neuronal infection and a general\ncessation of viral replication. Alternatively, if Sp4 does not\nsynergize with 1E62 but binds to the GC box 1 element, it\ncould, even at reduced levels and possibly in conjunction with\nneuronal factors, act to suppress VZV DNA replication. Both\nof these scenarios would likely increase the chances for a\nswitch from lytic to latent infection. Conversely, low levels of\nSp1 and decreased levels of Sp4 during reactivation could lead\nto increased ef\ufb01ciency of viral DNA replication. Thus, the\ncis-acting GC box 1 element within the downstream region of\nVZV oriS and the interplay of various levels of Sp1 and Sp4\ncould potentially be involved in the establishment and/or re-\nactivation of VZV latency.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by NIH grants AI18449 and AI36884.\nM.I.K. was supported in part by a scholarship from the Egyptian\nMinistry of Higher Education.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Papilloma re-\ngression is deemed to be due to a cell-mediated immune response, the nature of which is still ill de\ufb01ned, and\nis accompanied by immune cell in\ufb01ltrates. To gain further information on the nature and role of the immune\ncells present in regressing papillomas, we have analyzed biopsies of papillomas induced in the soft palate of\ncattle by bovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) and have phenotypically characterized and quanti\ufb01ed the\nlymphocytes present in these lesions. Eleven papilloma biopsies and seven biopsies of noninfected palate were\nanalyzed for the presence of activated CD41, CD81, and gd(WC11) lymphocytes. We found large numbers of\nlymphocytes in the subepithelial derma of papillomas but not in normal palate tissue; these cellular masses\nconsisted predominantly of CD41 lymphocytes, with only a few CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes, generally\npositioned at the periphery of these masses. All three subtypes of lymphocytes were found interdigitated with\nthe cells of the basal layer both in papillomas and in normal palate tissue, but while basal layer CD81 and\ngd(WC11) T cells were detected with similar frequencies in papillomas and uninfected palate, basal layer\nCD41 T cells were much more frequent in papillomas. CD41, CD81, and gd(WC11) lymphocytes were found\nin the suprabasal layers of papillomas, but the CD81 and gd(WC11) T cells were more numerous and had\nmigrated further into the differentiating keratinocytes of the papilloma fronds than the CD41 T cells. We\nconclude that T-cell in\ufb01ltration is characteristic of regressing BPV-4 papillomas, that CD41 lymphocytes are\nspeci\ufb01cally and massively recruited into the regressing papillomas, and that although all three lymphocyte\nsubsets can penetrate the papilloma, only the CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes are able to migrate into the\nfronds. These results suggest that all three lymphocyte subsets have an important role to ful\ufb01ll during natural\nregression of papillomas.\nPapillomaviruses infect mucous and cutaneous epithelia and\ninduce hyperplastic lesions, de\ufb01ned as warts, papillomas, or\ncondylomas. These lesions are generally benign, but if they are\naccompanied by other cellular changes, often induced by ex-\nposure to environmental carcinogens, then cancers can de-\nvelop (13). Natural regression of papillomas has been found in\nhumans and animals (15, 19, 24, 27), and histological exami-\nnation of the regressing lesions has revealed marked in\ufb01ltra-\ntion of lymphocytes in both the epithelium and the dermis.\nExperimentally regression of papillomas can be induced in\nanimals by immunization with de\ufb01ned viral antigens (2, 16, 26),\nand also in these cases, regression is accompanied by in\ufb01ltrates\nof immune cells. These results, coupled with the observation\nthat papillomas and other papillomavirus-induced lesions do\nnot regress in individuals whose cellular immune responses are\ncompromised (1), strongly suggest that cellular immunity plays\nan important role in their regression. However the precise\nimmunological basis for the rejection of papillomas is still\npoorly understood.\nBovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) infects the mucous\nepithelium of upper alimentary canal of cattle and induces\nbenign papillomas which in immunocompetent animals are\nrejected approximately 1 year after the onset of infection (15). 1n cattle chronically immunosuppressed by a diet of bracken\nfern, the papillomas spread and persist and become a focus for\nneoplastic progression to squamous cell carcinomas (3), con-\n\ufb01rming that the integrity of the immune system is pivotal to the\nability of the host to undergo tumor rejection. Experimental\nrejection of BPV-4 papillomas has been achieved by immuniz-\ning cattle with the viral protein E7 (2), and the regressing\npapillomas showed in\ufb01ltrates of immune cells similar to those\nobserved in naturally regressing tumors.\nThe BPV-4 system is the most extensively studied animal\nmodel of mucosal papillomavirus infection applicable to the\nanogenital and respiratory epithelia in humans. As the immune\nmechanisms that control BPV-4 infection in cattle are likely to\nbe similar to those in humans, an investigation of the events\noccurring during BPV-4 papilloma rejection should shed light\non the rejection processes occurring in humans. To this end,\nwe have analyzed the lymphocyte populations in\ufb01ltrating nat-\nurally regressing BPV-4 papillomas, and here we report on\ntheir phenotype and distribution within the lesions.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAnimals and infection with BPV-4. Young calves (8 to 12 weeks old) were\ninfected in the soft palate by intradermal inoculation of 1011 particles of BPV-4\nin 10 sites (1010 particles per site) (2). The mouths were examined for lesions at\nintervals of 4 to 6 weeks. After approximately 32 weeks, papillomas that were\ndeemed to be undergoing rejection by macroscopic criteria were biopsied with\nthe underlying derma. Biopsies from the soft palate of control noninfected\nanimals were also taken.\nHistology. Biopsies were bisected; one half were snap-frozen by immersion in\nliquid nitrogen for immunocytochemical analysis, the other half were \ufb01xed in\nbuffered formalin for subsequent embedding in paraf\ufb01n wax. Paraf\ufb01n blocks were\nsectioned and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin.\n* Corresponding author.

Cryostat sections were cut from the snap-frozen pap-\nillomas, air dried, and then stored at 2208C. Sections were thawed and \ufb01xed in\nchilled acetone before being stained with the following monoclonal antibodies\n(MAbs): CC30 (anti-CD4), CC63 (anti-CD8) (12), CC15 (anti-WC1 antigen of\ngd T cells [5]), and 1LA-111 (anti-a-chain interleukin-2 receptor [IL2-R] [22]).\nPrior to use on cryosections, all of these MAbs were shown by \ufb02uorescence-\nactivated cell sorting to be reactive against bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes\n(not shown). MAbs were incubated with sections for 1 h at room temperature in\na moist chamber. Sections were then washed three times with phosphate-buff-\nered saline, and bound antibodies were revealed by using peroxidase-conjugated\nreagents from a Vector ABC Elite kit speci\ufb01c for mouse antibodies, with dia-\nminobenzidine as the chromogen. The tissue sections counterstained with eosin.\nHematoxylin-and-eosin staining of two sections cut at the beginning and end\nof each run of frozen sections was used for measuring area and length of\nepithelium.\nEnumeration of cell types. The sections of papillomas and uninfected palate\nwere divided into four regions: region 1, the subepithelial derma; region 2, the\nbasal cell layer; region 3, the invaginations of the derma into the body of the\npapilloma (this region is contiguous with the subbasal region de\ufb01ned as region\n1); and region 4, the area above the basal cell layer (excluding region 3), pri-\nmarily comprising differentiating keratinocytes. 1n many sections, \ufb01xed bound-\naries of region 1 were often dif\ufb01cult to de\ufb01ne, and the lymphocytes were too\nnumerous to count; therefore numerical data from this region were not gener-\nated. 1n serial sections, regions 2, 3, and 4 formed relatively constant areas in\nwhich to count CD41, CD81, gd(WC11), and 1L2-R1 lymphocytes, and there-\nfore quantitative data are provided for these regions. For each biopsy specimen,\nthe areas of regions 3 and 4 and the length of the basal cell layer were calculated\nfrom two sections that were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The microscope\nslides were screened in a slide scanner; the image was manipulated by using\nAdobe Photoshop and analyzed by using an NIH package. A microscope slide\nwith a 1-mm line etched on it was used to calibrate the images. For each\nspecimen, the mean of the two slides was taken. The densities for each type of\nlymphocyte are expressed as cell numbers per square millimeter in regions 3 and\n4 and as cell numbers per millimeter in region 2.\nStatistical analysis of lymphocyte counts. Differences in the density of CD41,\nCD81, and gd(WC11) lymphocytes among regions 2, 3, and 4 were analyzed by\nusing paired t tests. Paired t tests are appropriate because the comparisons are\nbased on individual differences in cell counts between two regions within the\nsame specimen. The paired differences were then combined for the papillomas or\nuninfected palatine biopsies. Differences in density of lymphocyte subtypes in a\nparticular region between the papillomas and the uninfected palate samples were\nanalyzed by using an unpaired t test.\nRESULTS\nEleven papillomas and seven control palate samples were\nstained with the panel of MAbs; only photographs from rep-\nresentative papillomas are presented.\nHistological analysis. Histological examination of the pap-\nilloma biopsies clearly demonstrated mononuclear in\ufb01ltrates in\nall of them. 1n some biopsies, the in\ufb01ltration was particularly\nsevere, with large masses of lymphocytes in the subbasal derma\n(Fig. 1A). 1n contrast, no in\ufb01ltrate was observed in nonregress-\ning papillomas (Fig. 1B) or in noninfected palate (see Fig. 5).\nDistribution of lymphocyte subtypes in regressing papillo-\nmas. 1n regressing papillomas, the CD41 lymphocytes were\npredominantly distributed in regions 1 (cell counts not given)\nand 3, that is, in the derma and its invaginations. Few CD41\nlymphocytes were present in the basal layer (region 2), inter-\ndigitated with the epithelial cells, and were only sporadically\nfound in region 4 (Fig. 2B and Table 1). CD81 lymphocytes\nwere also found in regions 1, 2, and 3 and in relatively large\nnumbers also in region 4, among the keratinocytes of the su-\nprabasal layers (Fig. 2C and F and Table 1). The pattern of\ngd(WC11) lymphocytes distribution was similar to that of\nCD81 lymphocytes (Fig. 2D and Table 1). 1n contrast to the epithelial cells of the basal layers of the\npapilloma, the great majority of lymphocytes was negative for\nKi-67, a MAb speci\ufb01c for a nuclear antigen associated with cell\nproliferation (8) (Fig. 2E), indicating that the lymphocytes\nwere not proliferating in situ.\nThe mean densities of each type of lymphocyte in regions 2,\n3, and 4 are shown in Table 1. Within region 1, there was a\nlarger population of CD41 than of CD81 cells; although these\ncells were too numerous to count, this conclusion is con\ufb01rmed\nby the greater density of CD41 than of CD81 cells in region 3,\nwhich is contiguous with region 1. There were no signi\ufb01cant\ndifferences in the numbers of CD41 and CD81 cells within the\nbasal cell layer (region 2). 1n region 4, there were signi\ufb01cantly\nhigher densities of CD81 than of CD41 cells. The densities of\ngd(WC11) lymphocytes in regions 2, 3, and 4 were generally\nhigher than those of CD81 lymphocytes. The P values for these\ndifferences are shown in Table 2. 1n some papillomas, there were large foci of lymphocytes\nsituated either just beneath or straddling the basal cell layer.\nAlthough within each focus the densities of cells were too great\nto allow precise counts, it was obvious that the overwhelming\nmajority of cells consisted of CD41 lymphocytes (Fig. 3A).\nCD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes were also present, although\nthey were not evenly distributed within the cluster of CD41\ncells but restricted to the fringes of each focus (Fig. 3B and C). 1n two cases, as illustrated by papilloma 331/P1 in Fig. 4, these\nclusters of lymphocytes appeared to destroy the integrity of the\nbasal cell layer and to in\ufb01ltrate deep in the papilloma.\nDistribution of lymphocyte subtypes in uninfected palate.\nThe distribution and mean densities of lymphocytes in unin-\nfected palatine biopsies are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. There\nwere no appreciable lymphocyte deposits in the subepithelial\nderma. There were signi\ufb01cantly higher densities of CD81 than\nof CD41 cells in regions 2 and 4, and the gd(WC11) lympho-\ncytes were more numerous than CD41 cells in all regions\nand more numerous than CD81 cells in regions 2 and 3. The\nP values for the observed differences are shown in Table 2.\nFIG. 1. Hematoxylin-and-eosin staining of histological sections of regressing papilloma 78/P2 (A) and a nonregressing papilloma (B).

A comparison of the mean\ndensities of lymphocytes between regressing papillomas and\nuninfected palatine biopsies is shown with P values in Table 1.\nThe major differences in lymphocyte densities were found in\nregion 1, where no large deposits were seen in normal palatine\nbiopsies, and in region 4, where the densities of CD41, CD81,\nand gd(WC11) lymphocytes were signi\ufb01cantly higher in pap-\nillomas than in the uninfected palates. 1n regions 2 and 3, only\nthe densities of CD41 cells in papillomas exceeded that of\nuninfected palates, and there were no signi\ufb01cant differences in\nthe number of CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes in these\nregions.\nCD41, CD81, and gd1 lymphocytes express 1L2-R. Acti-\nvated lymphocytes express the a and b chains of 1L2-R (28).\nTo establish the state of activation of the lymphocyte subtypes\nin papillomas, sections were stained with MAb 1LA-111, which\nspeci\ufb01cally recognizes the a chain of 1L2-R.

First,\nthe ability to detect individual types of lymphocytes on sequen-\ntial sections was investigated. For one specimen, three sequen-\ntial sections were stained for CD41, CD81, and gd(WC11)\nlymphocytes (nine slides in all). Sections were photographed,\nand the positions of a minimum of 25 individual lymphocytes\n(often more if heavily in\ufb01ltrated) in the \ufb01rst section were\nnoted; these positions were then checked in the second and\nthird sections. The percentages detected for CD41, CD81, and\ngd(WC11) were 75, 60, and 82, respectively, in the second\nsection and 25, 24, and 26, respectively, in the third section.\nHaving veri\ufb01ed that most lymphocytes could be identi\ufb01ed in\npairs of serial sections, these sections were stained with 1LA-\n111 and either CC30 (IL2-R1 and CD41), CC63 (IL2-R1 and\nCD81), or CC15 [IL2-R1 and gd(WC11)]. Many lymphocytes\nin all regions of the papillomas, including the large foci in the\nsubepithelial derma, expressed 1L2-R (Fig. 3D and 4D and\nTable 1). 1L2-R1 lymphocytes were counted in regions 2 and 4.\nForty percent of CD41, 33% of CD81, and 62% of gd(WC11)\nlymphocytes were 1L2-R1, indicating that, allowing for the\npercentage of cells detected in the second section, approxi-\nmately half of CD41 and CD81 lymphocytes and three-quar-\nters of gd(WC11) lymphocytes expressed 1L2-R and were\ntherefore activated. 1n one papilloma, the lymphocytes ap-\npeared to be 1L2-R2; the signi\ufb01cance of this is not understood. 1n contrast to papillomas in which 1L2-R1 lymphocytes were\nfound in all areas, in normal palatine biopsies only lympho-\ncytes in region 2 were 1L2-R1 (Table 1).\nDISCUSSION\nNatural regression of papillomavirus-induced tumors is ac-\ncompanied by marked in\ufb01ltration of lymphocytes (6, 15, 23, 24,\n27). Similar in\ufb01ltrates have been observed in papillomas re-\ngressing as a result of either vaccination (16) or intralesion\nimmunotherapy with Corynebacterium parvum (9). The precise\nmechanism of rejection is not known, nor is it known whether\nthe lymphocytes are activated against viral or cellular antigens,\nalthough in the case of vaccine-induced regression, lympho-\ncytes proliferate in vitro in response to the immunizing viral\nantigen (20).\nAs part of our investigations into the mechanisms of papil-\nloma rejection in the BPV-4 system, we have analyzed the\nphenotype of the T lymphocytes in\ufb01ltrating naturally regress-\ning papillomas. We have repeatedly observed that natural re-\ngression of upper alimentary canal papillomas starts approxi-\nmately 8 to 12 months after infection. 1ndeed, papillomas that\nwere deemed to have entered rejection by visual inspection\nwere shown by histopathological analysis to be massively in\ufb01l-\ntrated by immune cells. This contrasts with the absence of such\nheavy in\ufb01ltrates in nonregressing papillomas and in uninfected\npalate, where many fewer lymphocytes can be detected. The\npresence of large numbers of lymphocytes does seem therefore\nto correlate with the regressing status of the lesions. A similar\nconclusion has been reached for regressing papillomas induced\nby cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (23) and for regressing gen-\nital condylomas in humans (6). 1n both cases, regressing lesions\nwere in\ufb01ltrated by lymphocytes, which were much more nu-\nmerous than in noninfected epithelium or nonregressing le-\nsions. As in regressing cottontail rabbit papillomavirus warts\n(23), the lymphocytes in regressing BPV-4 papillomas were not\nproliferating, suggesting that their activation and expansion\ntake place elsewhere. 1n regressing BPV-4 papillomas, there were discernible dif-\nferences in the types of lymphocytes that populated different\nregions of the lesions. The predominant subtype of T lympho-\ncyte in these papillomas was by far the CD41 cell. The great\nmajority of CD41 cells were present in the subepithelial\nderma, where they often formed clusters. Some CD41 cells\nwere also located interdigitating with the cells of the basal and\nsuprabasal layers, but in these regions, CD81 and gd(WC11)\nlymphocytes were more prominent. 1n one papilloma, the\nCD81 lymphocytes were found among the highly differentiated\nfrond keratinocytes, adjacent to the keratin layer. This differ-\nential distribution would suggest that either CD41 lympho-\ncytes are less able than other lymphocyte subtypes to migrate\nacross the basal cell layer and into the body of the papilloma or\nthat CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes are speci\ufb01cally at-\ntracted into the suprabasal layers. Since CD81 lymphocytes are\ngenerally regarded as the major cytolytic cells, their proximity\nTABLE 1.

Lymphocytes were also found among the differ-\nentiated keratinocytes in regressing cottontail rabbit papillo-\nmavirus papillomas, but their phenotype was not established\n(23). 1n regressing genital condylomas in humans, large num-\nbers of CD41 and CD81 cells are found within both the stroma\nand the surface epithelium of the lesion, but gd lymphocytes\nwere not investigated (6). The preponderance of CD41 cells\nlead to the suggestion that regression of genital warts was\nmediated by CD41 lymphocytes and was probably due to a\ndelayed-type hypersensitivity response (6), in analogy to what\nwas previously observed in experimental systems (4, 21) and in\nrabbits with regressing papillomas (11). Also in regressing\nBPV-4 papillomas, the massive recruitment of CD41 lympho-\ncytes in the subbasal derma, and occasionally intraepithelially,\npoints to an important involvement of these cells in regression.\nRuminants have large amounts of gd lymphocytes both as\nnewborns and as adults (10). These cells are particularly prom-\nFIG. 3. Lymphocyte subtypes in a cell cluster in subbasal space of papilloma 78/P2.

They appear to have multiple roles (17): they can rec-\nognize antigen independently of major histocompatibility com-\nplex restriction (25), appear to be involved in delayed-type\nhypersensitivity responses (7), provide surveillance functions\nagainst microbes (14), and recently have been implicated in the\nmaintenance of epithelial integrity (18). 1n regressing BPV-4\npapillomas, gd(WC11) lymphocytes are found in even larger\nnumbers than CD81 cells and in the same location, although\nthey do not appear to migrate as far into the papilloma fronds\nas the latter. They are also more numerous than CD81 lym-\nphocytes in noninfected palate. 1t is not known what their role\nmay be in papilloma regression, but their recruitment into\nregressing lesions suggests that they may take part in the re-\ngression process, as suggested also by Hall et al. (9) in the case\nof bovine skin papillomas regressing after intralesional immu-\nnotherapy. Further investigation is needed to establish this\npoint.\nLarger clusters of lymphocytes are often found in the sub-\nbasal derma; all three subtypes of lymphocytes are found in the\nclusters, but intriguingly, CD41 cells, the most numerous, ap-\npear to position themselves in the middle of the cluster,\nwhereas CD81 and gd(WC11) cells position themselves at the\nperiphery. The signi\ufb01cance, if any, of this is unknown. 1n three\ncases of the present series of regressing papillomas, the integ-\nrity of the basal cell layer appeared destroyed and the lympho-\ncyte cluster, including CD41 cells, had penetrated into the\nsuprabasal layers of the papilloma. This situation may repre-\nsent one of the last stages of tumor regression. 1t is interesting\nthat as long as the basal layer maintains its integrity, very few\nCD41 lymphocytes are found within the keratinocytes, but\nonce the basal layer is breached, they migrate into the papil-\nloma in large numbers. The stimuli that trigger the clustering\nof lymphocytes in the subbasal space and the in\ufb01ltration of the\npapilloma are unknown.\nThe lymphocytes present in the papillomas are 1L2-R1 and\nare therefore activated. Whether they are activated by viral\nantigens, and if so which one, or by cellular antigens is not\nknown. Heavy in\ufb01ltration of lymphocytes has been observed in\nboth BPV-2 and BPV-4 papillomas regressing after vaccination\nwith the viral proteins L2 and E7, respectively (2, 16). 1n\nE7-vaccinated calves, T lymphocytes showed a proliferative\nresponse to the E7 antigen when challenged in vitro, both\nbefore and during papilloma regression (20), suggesting that\nE7-speci\ufb01c T cells played a role in the regression process. 1n\nthat study, it was also found that in control nonvaccinated\nanimals, E7-speci\ufb01c T lymphocytes were detected only at the\nlast stages of papilloma development, before natural regres-\nsion, again suggesting an involvement of E7-speci\ufb01c T cells in\npapilloma regression.\nFurther analysis needs to be conducted to determine wheth-\ner the immunological mechanisms of natural rejection are sim-\nFIG. 4.

Our results for nat-\nurally regressing papillomas and those of Hall et al. (9) for\nimmunotherapy-treated regressing papillomas suggest that this\ncould indeed be the case.

Papilloma re-\ngression is deemed to be due to a cell-mediated immune response, the nature of which is still ill de\ufb01ned, and\nis accompanied by immune cell in\ufb01ltrates. To gain further information on the nature and role of the immune\ncells present in regressing papillomas, we have analyzed biopsies of papillomas induced in the soft palate of\ncattle by bovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) and have phenotypically characterized and quanti\ufb01ed the\nlymphocytes present in these lesions. Eleven papilloma biopsies and seven biopsies of noninfected palate were\nanalyzed for the presence of activated CD41, CD81, and gd(WC11) lymphocytes. We found large numbers of\nlymphocytes in the subepithelial derma of papillomas but not in normal palate tissue; these cellular masses\nconsisted predominantly of CD41 lymphocytes, with only a few CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes, generally\npositioned at the periphery of these masses. All three subtypes of lymphocytes were found interdigitated with\nthe cells of the basal layer both in papillomas and in normal palate tissue, but while basal layer CD81 and\ngd(WC11) T cells were detected with similar frequencies in papillomas and uninfected palate, basal layer\nCD41 T cells were much more frequent in papillomas. CD41, CD81, and gd(WC11) lymphocytes were found\nin the suprabasal layers of papillomas, but the CD81 and gd(WC11) T cells were more numerous and had\nmigrated further into the differentiating keratinocytes of the papilloma fronds than the CD41 T cells. We\nconclude that T-cell in\ufb01ltration is characteristic of regressing BPV-4 papillomas, that CD41 lymphocytes are\nspeci\ufb01cally and massively recruited into the regressing papillomas, and that although all three lymphocyte\nsubsets can penetrate the papilloma, only the CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes are able to migrate into the\nfronds. These results suggest that all three lymphocyte subsets have an important role to ful\ufb01ll during natural\nregression of papillomas.\nPapillomaviruses infect mucous and cutaneous epithelia and\ninduce hyperplastic lesions, de\ufb01ned as warts, papillomas, or\ncondylomas. These lesions are generally benign, but if they are\naccompanied by other cellular changes, often induced by ex-\nposure to environmental carcinogens, then cancers can de-\nvelop (13). Natural regression of papillomas has been found in\nhumans and animals (15, 19, 24, 27), and histological exami-\nnation of the regressing lesions has revealed marked in\ufb01ltra-\ntion of lymphocytes in both the epithelium and the dermis.\nExperimentally regression of papillomas can be induced in\nanimals by immunization with de\ufb01ned viral antigens (2, 16, 26),\nand also in these cases, regression is accompanied by in\ufb01ltrates\nof immune cells. These results, coupled with the observation\nthat papillomas and other papillomavirus-induced lesions do\nnot regress in individuals whose cellular immune responses are\ncompromised (1), strongly suggest that cellular immunity plays\nan important role in their regression. However the precise\nimmunological basis for the rejection of papillomas is still\npoorly understood.\nBovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) infects the mucous\nepithelium of upper alimentary canal of cattle and induces\nbenign papillomas which in immunocompetent animals are\nrejected approximately 1 year after the onset of infection (15).\nIn cattle chronically immunosuppressed by a diet of bracken\nfern, the papillomas spread and persist and become a focus for\nneoplastic progression to squamous cell carcinomas (3), con-\n\ufb01rming that the integrity of the immune system is pivotal to the\nability of the host to undergo tumor rejection. Experimental\nrejection of BPV-4 papillomas has been achieved by immuniz-\ning cattle with the viral protein E7 (2), and the regressing\npapillomas showed in\ufb01ltrates of immune cells similar to those\nobserved in naturally regressing tumors.\nThe BPV-4 system is the most extensively studied animal\nmodel of mucosal papillomavirus infection applicable to the\nanogenital and respiratory epithelia in humans. As the immune\nmechanisms that control BPV-4 infection in cattle are likely to\nbe similar to those in humans, an investigation of the events\noccurring during BPV-4 papilloma rejection should shed light\non the rejection processes occurring in humans. To this end,\nwe have analyzed the lymphocyte populations in\ufb01ltrating nat-\nurally regressing BPV-4 papillomas, and here we report on\ntheir phenotype and distribution within the lesions.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAnimals and infection with BPV-4. Young calves (8 to 12 weeks old) were\ninfected in the soft palate by intradermal inoculation of 1011 particles of BPV-4\nin 10 sites (1010 particles per site) (2). The mouths were examined for lesions at\nintervals of 4 to 6 weeks. After approximately 32 weeks, papillomas that were\ndeemed to be undergoing rejection by macroscopic criteria were biopsied with\nthe underlying derma. Biopsies from the soft palate of control noninfected\nanimals were also taken.\nHistology. Biopsies were bisected; one half were snap-frozen by immersion in\nliquid nitrogen for immunocytochemical analysis, the other half were \ufb01xed in\nbuffered formalin for subsequent embedding in paraf\ufb01n wax. Paraf\ufb01n blocks were\nsectioned and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin.\n* Corresponding author.

Cryostat sections were cut from the snap-frozen pap-\nillomas, air dried, and then stored at 2208C. Sections were thawed and \ufb01xed in\nchilled acetone before being stained with the following monoclonal antibodies\n(MAbs): CC30 (anti-CD4), CC63 (anti-CD8) (12), CC15 (anti-WC1 antigen of\ngd T cells [5]), and ILA-111 (anti-a-chain interleukin-2 receptor [IL2-R] [22]).\nPrior to use on cryosections, all of these MAbs were shown by \ufb02uorescence-\nactivated cell sorting to be reactive against bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes\n(not shown). MAbs were incubated with sections for 1 h at room temperature in\na moist chamber. Sections were then washed three times with phosphate-buff-\nered saline, and bound antibodies were revealed by using peroxidase-conjugated\nreagents from a Vector ABC Elite kit speci\ufb01c for mouse antibodies, with dia-\nminobenzidine as the chromogen. The tissue sections counterstained with eosin.\nHematoxylin-and-eosin staining of two sections cut at the begiming and end\nof each run of frozen sections was used for measuring area and length of\nepithelium.\nEnumeration of cell types. The sections of papillomas and uninfected palate\nwere divided into four regions: region 1, the subepithelial derma; region 2, the\nbasal cell layer; region 3, the invaginations of the derma into the body of the\npapilloma (this region is contiguous with the subbasal region de\ufb01ned as region\n1); and region 4, the area above the basal cell layer (excluding region 3), pri-\nmarily comprising differentiating keratinocytes. In many sections, \ufb01xed bound-\naries of region 1 were often dif\ufb01cult to de\ufb01ne, and the lymphocytes were too\nnumerous to count; therefore numerical data from this region were not gener-\nated. In serial sections, regions 2, 3, and 4 formed relatively constant areas in\nwhich to count CD41, CD81, gd(WC11), and IL2-R1 lymphocytes, and there-\nfore quantitative data are provided for these regions. For each biopsy specimen,\nthe areas of regions 3 and 4 and the length of the basal cell layer were calculated\nfrom two sections that were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The microscope\nslides were screened in a slide scamer; the image was manipulated by using\nAdobe Photoshop and analyzed by using an NIH package. A microscope slide\nwith a 1-mm line etched on it was used to calibrate the images. For each\nspecimen, the mean of the two slides was taken. The densities for each type of\nlymphocyte are expressed as cell numbers per square millimeter in regions 3 and\n4 and as cell numbers per millimeter in region 2.\nStatistical analysis of lymphocyte counts. Differences in the density of CD41,\nCD81, and gd(WC11) lymphocytes among regions 2, 3, and 4 were analyzed by\nusing paired t tests. Paired t tests are appropriate because the comparisons are\nbased on individual differences in cell counts between two regions within the\nsame specimen. The paired differences were then combined for the papillomas or\nuninfected palatine biopsies. Differences in density of lymphocyte subtypes in a\nparticular region between the papillomas and the uninfected palate samples were\nanalyzed by using an unpaired t test.\nRESULTS\nEleven papillomas and seven control palate samples were\nstained with the panel of MAbs; only photographs from rep-\nresentative papillomas are presented.\nHistological analysis. Histological examination of the pap-\nilloma biopsies clearly demonstrated mononuclear in\ufb01ltrates in\nall of them. In some biopsies, the in\ufb01ltration was particularly\nsevere, with large masses of lymphocytes in the subbasal derma\n(Fig. 1A). In contrast, no in\ufb01ltrate was observed in nonregress-\ning papillomas (Fig. 1B) or in noninfected palate (see Fig. 5).\nDistribution of lymphocyte subtypes in regressing papillo-\nmas. In regressing papillomas, the CD41 lymphocytes were\npredominantly distributed in regions 1 (cell counts not given)\nand 3, that is, in the derma and its invaginations. Few CD41\nlymphocytes were present in the basal layer (region 2), inter-\ndigitated with the epithelial cells, and were only sporadically\nfound in region 4 (Fig. 2B and Table 1). CD81 lymphocytes\nwere also found in regions 1, 2, and 3 and in relatively large\nnumbers also in region 4, among the keratinocytes of the su-\nprabasal layers (Fig. 2C and F and Table 1). The pattern of\ngd(WC11) lymphocytes distribution was similar to that of\nCD81 lymphocytes (Fig. 2D and Table 1).\nIn contrast to the epithelial cells of the basal layers of the\npapilloma, the great majority of lymphocytes was negative for\nKi-67, a MAb speci\ufb01c for a nuclear antigen associated with cell\nproliferation (8) (Fig. 2E), indicating that the lymphocytes\nwere not proliferating in situ.\nThe mean densities of each type of lymphocyte in regions 2,\n3, and 4 are shown in Table 1. Within region 1, there was a\nlarger population of CD41 than of CD81 cells; although these\ncells were too numerous to count, this conclusion is con\ufb01rmed\nby the greater density of CD41 than of CD81 cells in region 3,\nwhich is contiguous with region 1. There were no signi\ufb01cant\ndifferences in the numbers of CD41 and CD81 cells within the\nbasal cell layer (region 2). In region 4, there were signi\ufb01cantly\nhigher densities of CD81 than of CD41 cells. The densities of\ngd(WC11) lymphocytes in regions 2, 3, and 4 were generally\nhigher than those of CD81 lymphocytes. The P values for these\ndifferences are shown in Table 2.\nIn some papillomas, there were large foci of lymphocytes\nsituated either just beneath or straddling the basal cell layer.\nAlthough within each focus the densities of cells were too great\nto allow precise counts, it was obvious that the overwhelming\nmajority of cells consisted of CD41 lymphocytes (Fig. 3A).\nCD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes were also present, although\nthey were not evenly distributed within the cluster of CD41\ncells but restricted to the fringes of each focus (Fig. 3B and C).\nIn two cases, as illustrated by papilloma 331/P1 in Fig. 4, these\nclusters of lymphocytes appeared to destroy the integrity of the\nbasal cell layer and to in\ufb01ltrate deep in the papilloma.\nDistribution of lymphocyte subtypes in uninfected palate.\nThe distribution and mean densities of lymphocytes in unin-\nfected palatine biopsies are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. There\nwere no appreciable lymphocyte deposits in the subepithelial\nderma. There were signi\ufb01cantly higher densities of CD81 than\nof CD41 cells in regions 2 and 4, and the gd(WC11) lympho-\ncytes were more numerous than CD41 cells in all regions\nand more numerous than CD81 cells in regions 2 and 3. The\nP values for the observed differences are shown in Table 2.\nFIG. 1. Hematoxylin-and-eosin staining of histological sections of regressing papilloma 78/P2 (A) and a nonregressing papilloma (B).

A comparison of the mean\ndensities of lymphocytes between regressing papillomas and\nuninfected palatine biopsies is shown with P values in Table 1.\nThe major differences in lymphocyte densities were found in\nregion 1, where no large deposits were seen in normal palatine\nbiopsies, and in region 4, where the densities of CD41, CD81,\nand gd(WC11) lymphocytes were signi\ufb01cantly higher in pap-\nillomas than in the uninfected palates. In regions 2 and 3, only\nthe densities of CD41 cells in papillomas exceeded that of\nuninfected palates, and there were no signi\ufb01cant differences in\nthe number of CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes in these\nregions.\nCD41, CD81, and gd1 lymphocytes express IL2-R. Acti-\nvated lymphocytes express the a and b chains of IL2-R (28).\nTo establish the state of activation of the lymphocyte subtypes\nin papillomas, sections were stained with MAb ILA-111, which\nspeci\ufb01cally recognizes the a chain of IL2-R.

First,\nthe ability to detect individual types of lymphocytes on sequen-\ntial sections was investigated. For one specimen, three sequen-\ntial sections were stained for CD41, CD81, and gd(WC11)\nlymphocytes (nine slides in all). Sections were photographed,\nand the positions of a minimum of 25 individual lymphocytes\n(often more if heavily in\ufb01ltrated) in the \ufb01rst section were\nnoted; these positions were then checked in the second and\nthird sections. The percentages detected for CD41, CD81, and\ngd(WC11) were 75, 60, and 82, respectively, in the second\nsection and 25, 24, and 26, respectively, in the third section.\nHaving veri\ufb01ed that most lymphocytes could be identi\ufb01ed in\npairs of serial sections, these sections were stained with ILA-\n111 and either CC30 (IL2-R1 and CD41), CC63 (IL2-R1 and\nCD81), or CC15 [IL2-R1 and gd(WC11)]. Many lymphocytes\nin all regions of the papillomas, including the large foci in the\nsubepithelial derma, expressed IL2-R (Fig. 3D and 4D and\nTable 1). IL2-R1 lymphocytes were counted in regions 2 and 4.\nForty percent of CD41, 33% of CD81, and 62% of gd(WC11)\nlymphocytes were IL2-R1, indicating that, allowing for the\npercentage of cells detected in the second section, approxi-\nmately half of CD41 and CD81 lymphocytes and three-quar-\nters of gd(WC11) lymphocytes expressed IL2-R and were\ntherefore activated. In one papilloma, the lymphocytes ap-\npeared to be IL2-R2; the signi\ufb01cance of this is not understood.\nIn contrast to papillomas in which IL2-R1 lymphocytes were\nfound in all areas, in normal palatine biopsies only lympho-\ncytes in region 2 were IL2-R1 (Table 1).\nDISCUSSION\nNatural regression of papillomavirus-induced tumors is ac-\ncompanied by marked in\ufb01ltration of lymphocytes (6, 15, 23, 24,\n27). Similar in\ufb01ltrates have been observed in papillomas re-\ngressing as a result of either vaccination (16) or intralesion\nimmunotherapy with Corynebacterium parvum (9). The precise\nmechanism of rejection is not known, nor is it known whether\nthe lymphocytes are activated against viral or cellular antigens,\nalthough in the case of vaccine-induced regression, lympho-\ncytes proliferate in vitro in response to the immunizing viral\nantigen (20).\nAs part of our investigations into the mechanisms of papil-\nloma rejection in the BPV-4 system, we have analyzed the\nphenotype of the T lymphocytes in\ufb01ltrating naturally regress-\ning papillomas. We have repeatedly observed that natural re-\ngression of upper alimentary canal papillomas starts approxi-\nmately 8 to 12 months after infection. Indeed, papillomas that\nwere deemed to have entered rejection by visual inspection\nwere shown by histopathological analysis to be massively in\ufb01l-\ntrated by immune cells. This contrasts with the absence of such\nheavy in\ufb01ltrates in nonregressing papillomas and in uninfected\npalate, where many fewer lymphocytes can be detected. The\npresence of large numbers of lymphocytes does seem therefore\nto correlate with the regressing status of the lesions. A similar\nconclusion has been reached for regressing papillomas induced\nby cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (23) and for regressing gen-\nital condylomas in humans (6). In both cases, regressing lesions\nwere in\ufb01ltrated by lymphocytes, which were much more nu-\nmerous than in noninfected epithelium or nonregressing le-\nsions. As in regressing cottontail rabbit papillomavirus warts\n(23), the lymphocytes in regressing BPV-4 papillomas were not\nproliferating, suggesting that their activation and expansion\ntake place elsewhere.\nIn regressing BPV-4 papillomas, there were discernible dif-\nferences in the types of lymphocytes that populated different\nregions of the lesions. The predominant subtype of T lympho-\ncyte in these papillomas was by far the CD41 cell. The great\nmajority of CD41 cells were present in the subepithelial\nderma, where they often formed clusters. Some CD41 cells\nwere also located interdigitating with the cells of the basal and\nsuprabasal layers, but in these regions, CD81 and gd(WC11)\nlymphocytes were more prominent. In one papilloma, the\nCD81 lymphocytes were found among the highly differentiated\nfrond keratinocytes, adjacent to the keratin layer. This differ-\nential distribution would suggest that either CD41 lympho-\ncytes are less able than other lymphocyte subtypes to migrate\nacross the basal cell layer and into the body of the papilloma or\nthat CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes are speci\ufb01cally at-\ntracted into the suprabasal layers. Since CD81 lymphocytes are\ngenerally regarded as the major cytolytic cells, their proximity\nTABLE 1.

Lymphocytes were also found among the differ-\nentiated keratinocytes in regressing cottontail rabbit papillo-\nmavirus papillomas, but their phenotype was not established\n(23). In regressing genital condylomas in humans, large num-\nbers of CD41 and CD81 cells are found within both the stroma\nand the surface epithelium of the lesion, but gd lymphocytes\nwere not investigated (6). The preponderance of CD41 cells\nlead to the suggestion that regression of genital warts was\nmediated by CD41 lymphocytes and was probably due to a\ndelayed-type hypersensitivity response (6), in analogy to what\nwas previously observed in experimental systems (4, 21) and in\nrabbits with regressing papillomas (11). Also in regressing\nBPV-4 papillomas, the massive recruitment of CD41 lympho-\ncytes in the subbasal derma, and occasionally intraepithelially,\npoints to an important involvement of these cells in regression.\nRuminants have large amounts of gd lymphocytes both as\nnewborns and as adults (10). These cells are particularly prom-\nFIG. 3. Lymphocyte subtypes in a cell cluster in subbasal space of papilloma 78/P2.

They appear to have multiple roles (17): they can rec-\nognize antigen independently of major histocompatibility com-\nplex restriction (25), appear to be involved in delayed-type\nhypersensitivity responses (7), provide surveillance functions\nagainst microbes (14), and recently have been implicated in the\nmaintenance of epithelial integrity (18). In regressing BPV-4\npapillomas, gd(WC11) lymphocytes are found in even larger\nnumbers than CD81 cells and in the same location, although\nthey do not appear to migrate as far into the papilloma fronds\nas the latter. They are also more numerous than CD81 lym-\nphocytes in noninfected palate. It is not known what their role\nmay be in papilloma regression, but their recruitment into\nregressing lesions suggests that they may take part in the re-\ngression process, as suggested also by Hall et al. (9) in the case\nof bovine skin papillomas regressing after intralesional immu-\nnotherapy. Further investigation is needed to establish this\npoint.\nLarger clusters of lymphocytes are often found in the sub-\nbasal derma; all three subtypes of lymphocytes are found in the\nclusters, but intriguingly, CD41 cells, the most numerous, ap-\npear to position themselves in the middle of the cluster,\nwhereas CD81 and gd(WC11) cells position themselves at the\nperiphery. The signi\ufb01cance, if any, of this is unknown. In three\ncases of the present series of regressing papillomas, the integ-\nrity of the basal cell layer appeared destroyed and the lympho-\ncyte cluster, including CD41 cells, had penetrated into the\nsuprabasal layers of the papilloma. This situation may repre-\nsent one of the last stages of tumor regression. It is interesting\nthat as long as the basal layer maintains its integrity, very few\nCD41 lymphocytes are found within the keratinocytes, but\nonce the basal layer is breached, they migrate into the papil-\nloma in large numbers. The stimuli that trigger the clustering\nof lymphocytes in the subbasal space and the in\ufb01ltration of the\npapilloma are unknown.\nThe lymphocytes present in the papillomas are IL2-R1 and\nare therefore activated. Whether they are activated by viral\nantigens, and if so which one, or by cellular antigens is not\nknown. Heavy in\ufb01ltration of lymphocytes has been observed in\nboth BPV-2 and BPV-4 papillomas regressing after vaccination\nwith the viral proteins L2 and E7, respectively (2, 16). In\nE7-vaccinated calves, T lymphocytes showed a proliferative\nresponse to the E7 antigen when challenged in vitro, both\nbefore and during papilloma regression (20), suggesting that\nE7-speci\ufb01c T cells played a role in the regression process. In\nthat study, it was also found that in control nonvaccinated\nanimals, E7-speci\ufb01c T lymphocytes were detected only at the\nlast stages of papilloma development, before natural regres-\nsion, again suggesting an involvement of E7-speci\ufb01c T cells in\npapilloma regression.\nFurther analysis needs to be conducted to determine wheth-\ner the immunological mechanisms of natural rejection are sim-\nFIG. 4.

Papilloma re-\ngression is deemed to be due to a cell-mediated immune response, the nature of which is still ill de\ufb01ned, and\nis accompanied by immune cell in\ufb01ltrates. To gain further information on the nature and role of the immune\ncells present in regressing papillomas, we have analyzed biopsies of papillomas induced in the soft palate of\ncattle by bovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) and have phenotypically characterized and quanti\ufb01ed the\nlymphocytes present in these lesions. Eleven papilloma biopsies and seven biopsies of noninfected palate were\nanalyzed for the presence of activated CD41, CD81, and gd(WC11) lymphocytes. We found large numbers of\nlymphocytes in the subepithelial derma of papillomas but not in normal palate tissue; these cellular masses\nconsisted predominantly of CD41 lymphocytes, with only a few CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes, generally\npositioned at the periphery of these masses. All three subtypes of lymphocytes were found interdigitated with\nthe cells of the basal layer both in papillomas and in normal palate tissue, but while basal layer CD81 and\ngd(WC11) T cells were detected with similar frequencies in papillomas and uninfected palate, basal layer\nCD41 T cells were much more frequent in papillomas. CD41, CD81, and gd(WC11) lymphocytes were found\nin the suprabasal layers of papillomas, but the CD81 and gd(WC11) T cells were more numerous and had\nmigrated further into the differentiating keratinocytes of the papilloma fronds than the CD41 T cells. We\nconclude that T-cell in\ufb01ltration is characteristic of regressing BPV-4 papillomas, that CD41 lymphocytes are\nspeci\ufb01cally and massively recruited into the regressing papillomas, and that although all three lymphocyte\nsubsets can penetrate the papilloma, only the CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes are able to migrate into the\nfronds. These results suggest that all three lymphocyte subsets have an important role to ful\ufb01ll during natural\nregression of papillomas.\nPapillomaviruses infect mucous and cutaneous epithelia and\ninduce hyperplastic lesions, de\ufb01ned as warts, papillomas, or\ncondylomas. These lesions are generally benign, but if they are\naccompanied by other cellular changes, often induced by ex-\nposure to environmental carcinogens, then cancers can de-\nvelop (13). Natural regression of papillomas has been found in\nhumans and animals (15, 19, 24, 27), and histological exami-\nnation of the regressing lesions has revealed marked in\ufb01ltra-\ntion of lymphocytes in both the epithelium and the dermis.\nExperimentally regression of papillomas can be induced in\nanimals by immunization with de\ufb01ned viral antigens (2, 16, 26),\nand also in these cases, regression is accompanied by in\ufb01ltrates\nof immune cells. These results, coupled with the observation\nthat papillomas and other papillomavirus-induced lesions do\nnot regress in individuals whose cellular immune responses are\ncompromised (1), strongly suggest that cellular immunity plays\nan important role in their regression. However the precise\nimmunological basis for the rejection of papillomas is still\npoorly understood.\nBovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) infects the mucous\nepithelium of upper alimentary canal of cattle and induces\nbenign papillomas which in immunocompetent animals are\nrejected approximately 1 year after the onset of infection (15).\nIn cattle chronically immunosuppressed by a diet of bracken\nfern, the papillomas spread and persist and become a focus for\nneoplastic progression to squamous cell carcinomas (3), con-\n\ufb01rming that the integrity of the immune system is pivotal to the\nability of the host to undergo tumor rejection. Experimental\nrejection of BPV-4 papillomas has been achieved by immuniz-\ning cattle with the viral protein E7 (2), and the regressing\npapillomas showed in\ufb01ltrates of immune cells similar to those\nobserved in naturally regressing tumors.\nThe BPV-4 system is the most extensively studied animal\nmodel of mucosal papillomavirus infection applicable to the\nanogenital and respiratory epithelia in humans. As the immune\nmechanisms that control BPV-4 infection in cattle are likely to\nbe similar to those in humans, an investigation of the events\noccurring during BPV-4 papilloma rejection should shed light\non the rejection processes occurring in humans. To this end,\nwe have analyzed the lymphocyte populations in\ufb01ltrating nat-\nurally regressing BPV-4 papillomas, and here we report on\ntheir phenotype and distribution within the lesions.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAnimals and infection with BPV-4. Young calves (8 to 12 weeks old) were\ninfected in the soft palate by intradermal inoculation of 1011 particles of BPV-4\nin 10 sites (1010 particles per site) (2). The mouths were examined for lesions at\nintervals of 4 to 6 weeks. After approximately 32 weeks, papillomas that were\ndeemed to be undergoing rejection by macroscopic criteria were biopsied with\nthe underlying derma. Biopsies from the soft palate of control noninfected\nanimals were also taken.\nHistology. Biopsies were bisected; one half were snap-frozen by immersion in\nliquid nitrogen for immunocytochemical analysis, the other half were \ufb01xed in\nbuffered formalin for subsequent embedding in paraf\ufb01n wax. Paraf\ufb01n blocks were\nsectioned and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin.\n* Corresponding author.

Cryostat sections were cut from the snap-frozen pap-\nillomas, air dried, and then stored at 2208C. Sections were thawed and \ufb01xed in\nchilled acetone before being stained with the following monoclonal antibodies\n(MAbs): CC30 (anti-CD4), CC63 (anti-CD8) (12), CC15 (anti-WC1 antigen of\ngd T cells [5]), and ILA-111 (anti-a-chain interleukin-2 receptor [IL2-R] [22]).\nPrior to use on cryosections, all of these MAbs were shown by \ufb02uorescence-\nactivated cell sorting to be reactive against bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes\n(not shown). MAbs were incubated with sections for 1 h at room temperature in\na moist chamber. Sections were then washed three times with phosphate-buff-\nered saline, and bound antibodies were revealed by using peroxidase-conjugated\nreagents from a Vector ABC Elite kit speci\ufb01c for mouse antibodies, with dia-\nminobenzidine as the chromogen. The tissue sections counterstained with eosin.\nHematoxylin-and-eosin staining of two sections cut at the beginning and end\nof each run of frozen sections was used for measuring area and length of\nepithelium.\nEnumeration of cell types. The sections of papillomas and uninfected palate\nwere divided into four regions: region 1, the subepithelial derma; region 2, the\nbasal cell layer; region 3, the invaginations of the derma into the body of the\npapilloma (this region is contiguous with the subbasal region de\ufb01ned as region\n1); and region 4, the area above the basal cell layer (excluding region 3), pri-\nmarily comprising differentiating keratinocytes. In many sections, \ufb01xed bound-\naries of region 1 were often dif\ufb01cult to de\ufb01ne, and the lymphocytes were too\nnumerous to count; therefore numerical data from this region were not gener-\nated. In serial sections, regions 2, 3, and 4 formed relatively constant areas in\nwhich to count CD41, CD81, gd(WC11), and IL2-R1 lymphocytes, and there-\nfore quantitative data are provided for these regions. For each biopsy specimen,\nthe areas of regions 3 and 4 and the length of the basal cell layer were calculated\nfrom two sections that were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The microscope\nslides were screened in a slide scanner; the image was manipulated by using\nAdobe Photoshop and analyzed by using an NIH package. A microscope slide\nwith a 1-mm line etched on it was used to calibrate the images. For each\nspecimen, the mean of the two slides was taken. The densities for each type of\nlymphocyte are expressed as cell numbers per square millimeter in regions 3 and\n4 and as cell numbers per millimeter in region 2.\nStatistical analysis of lymphocyte counts. Differences in the density of CD41,\nCD81, and gd(WC11) lymphocytes among regions 2, 3, and 4 were analyzed by\nusing paired t tests. Paired t tests are appropriate because the comparisons are\nbased on individual differences in cell counts between two regions within the\nsame specimen. The paired differences were then combined for the papillomas or\nuninfected palatine biopsies. Differences in density of lymphocyte subtypes in a\nparticular region between the papillomas and the uninfected palate samples were\nanalyzed by using an unpaired t test.\nRESULTS\nEleven papillomas and seven control palate samples were\nstained with the panel of MAbs; only photographs from rep-\nresentative papillomas are presented.\nHistological analysis. Histological examination of the pap-\nilloma biopsies clearly demonstrated mononuclear in\ufb01ltrates in\nall of them. In some biopsies, the in\ufb01ltration was particularly\nsevere, with large masses of lymphocytes in the subbasal derma\n(Fig. 1A). In contrast, no in\ufb01ltrate was observed in nonregress-\ning papillomas (Fig. 1B) or in noninfected palate (see Fig. 5).\nDistribution of lymphocyte subtypes in regressing papillo-\nmas. In regressing papillomas, the CD41 lymphocytes were\npredominantly distributed in regions 1 (cell counts not given)\nand 3, that is, in the derma and its invaginations. Few CD41\nlymphocytes were present in the basal layer (region 2), inter-\ndigitated with the epithelial cells, and were only sporadically\nfound in region 4 (Fig. 2B and Table 1). CD81 lymphocytes\nwere also found in regions 1, 2, and 3 and in relatively large\nnumbers also in region 4, among the keratinocytes of the su-\nprabasal layers (Fig. 2C and F and Table 1). The pattern of\ngd(WC11) lymphocytes distribution was similar to that of\nCD81 lymphocytes (Fig. 2D and Table 1).\nIn contrast to the epithelial cells of the basal layers of the\npapilloma, the great majority of lymphocytes was negative for\nKi-67, a MAb speci\ufb01c for a nuclear antigen associated with cell\nproliferation (8) (Fig. 2E), indicating that the lymphocytes\nwere not proliferating in situ.\nThe mean densities of each type of lymphocyte in regions 2,\n3, and 4 are shown in Table 1. Within region 1, there was a\nlarger population of CD41 than of CD81 cells; although these\ncells were too numerous to count, this conclusion is con\ufb01rmed\nby the greater density of CD41 than of CD81 cells in region 3,\nwhich is contiguous with region 1. There were no signi\ufb01cant\ndifferences in the numbers of CD41 and CD81 cells within the\nbasal cell layer (region 2). In region 4, there were signi\ufb01cantly\nhigher densities of CD81 than of CD41 cells. The densities of\ngd(WC11) lymphocytes in regions 2, 3, and 4 were generally\nhigher than those of CD81 lymphocytes. The P values for these\ndifferences are shown in Table 2.\nIn some papillomas, there were large foci of lymphocytes\nsituated either just beneath or straddling the basal cell layer.\nAlthough within each focus the densities of cells were too great\nto allow precise counts, it was obvious that the overwhelming\nmajority of cells consisted of CD41 lymphocytes (Fig. 3A).\nCD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes were also present, although\nthey were not evenly distributed within the cluster of CD41\ncells but restricted to the fringes of each focus (Fig. 3B and C).\nIn two cases, as illustrated by papilloma 331/P1 in Fig. 4, these\nclusters of lymphocytes appeared to destroy the integrity of the\nbasal cell layer and to in\ufb01ltrate deep in the papilloma.\nDistribution of lymphocyte subtypes in uninfected palate.\nThe distribution and mean densities of lymphocytes in unin-\nfected palatine biopsies are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. There\nwere no appreciable lymphocyte deposits in the subepithelial\nderma. There were signi\ufb01cantly higher densities of CD81 than\nof CD41 cells in regions 2 and 4, and the gd(WC11) lympho-\ncytes were more numerous than CD41 cells in all regions\nand more numerous than CD81 cells in regions 2 and 3. The\nP values for the observed differences are shown in Table 2.\nFIG. 1. Hematoxylin-and-eosin staining of histological sections of regressing papilloma 78/P2 (A) and a nonregressing papilloma (B).

A comparison of the mean\ndensities of lymphocytes between regressing papillomas and\nuninfected palatine biopsies is shown with P values in Table 1.\nThe major differences in lymphocyte densities were found in\nregion 1, where no large deposits were seen in normal palatine\nbiopsies, and in region 4, where the densities of CD41, CD81,\nand gd(WC11) lymphocytes were signi\ufb01cantly higher in pap-\nillomas than in the uninfected palates. In regions 2 and 3, only\nthe densities of CD41 cells in papillomas exceeded that of\nuninfected palates, and there were no signi\ufb01cant differences in\nthe number of CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes in these\nregions.\nCD41, CD81, and gd1 lymphocytes express IL2-R. Acti-\nvated lymphocytes express the a and b chains of IL2-R (28).\nTo establish the state of activation of the lymphocyte subtypes\nin papillomas, sections were stained with MAb ILA-111, which\nspeci\ufb01cally recognizes the a chain of IL2-R.

First,\nthe ability to detect individual types of lymphocytes on sequen-\ntial sections was investigated. For one specimen, three sequen-\ntial sections were stained for CD41, CD81, and gd(WC11)\nlymphocytes (nine slides in all). Sections were photographed,\nand the positions of a minimum of 25 individual lymphocytes\n(often more if heavily in\ufb01ltrated) in the \ufb01rst section were\nnoted; these positions were then checked in the second and\nthird sections. The percentages detected for CD41, CD81, and\ngd(WC11) were 75, 60, and 82, respectively, in the second\nsection and 25, 24, and 26, respectively, in the third section.\nHaving veri\ufb01ed that most lymphocytes could be identi\ufb01ed in\npairs of serial sections, these sections were stained with ILA-\n111 and either CC30 (IL2-R1 and CD41), CC63 (IL2-R1 and\nCD81), or CC15 [IL2-R1 and gd(WC11)]. Many lymphocytes\nin all regions of the papillomas, including the large foci in the\nsubepithelial derma, expressed IL2-R (Fig. 3D and 4D and\nTable 1). IL2-R1 lymphocytes were counted in regions 2 and 4.\nForty percent of CD41, 33% of CD81, and 62% of gd(WC11)\nlymphocytes were IL2-R1, indicating that, allowing for the\npercentage of cells detected in the second section, approxi-\nmately half of CD41 and CD81 lymphocytes and three-quar-\nters of gd(WC11) lymphocytes expressed IL2-R and were\ntherefore activated. In one papilloma, the lymphocytes ap-\npeared to be IL2-R2; the signi\ufb01cance of this is not understood.\nIn contrast to papillomas in which IL2-R1 lymphocytes were\nfound in all areas, in normal palatine biopsies only lympho-\ncytes in region 2 were IL2-R1 (Table 1).\nDISCUSSION\nNatural regression of papillomavirus-induced tumors is ac-\ncompanied by marked in\ufb01ltration of lymphocytes (6, 15, 23, 24,\n27). Similar in\ufb01ltrates have been observed in papillomas re-\ngressing as a result of either vaccination (16) or intralesion\nimmunotherapy with Corynebacterium parvum (9). The precise\nmechanism of rejection is not known, nor is it known whether\nthe lymphocytes are activated against viral or cellular antigens,\nalthough in the case of vaccine-induced regression, lympho-\ncytes proliferate in vitro in response to the immunizing viral\nantigen (20).\nAs part of our investigations into the mechanisms of papil-\nloma rejection in the BPV-4 system, we have analyzed the\nphenotype of the T lymphocytes in\ufb01ltrating naturally regress-\ning papillomas. We have repeatedly observed that natural re-\ngression of upper alimentary canal papillomas starts approxi-\nmately 8 to 12 months after infection. Indeed, papillomas that\nwere deemed to have entered rejection by visual inspection\nwere shown by histopathological analysis to be massively in\ufb01l-\ntrated by immune cells. This contrasts with the absence of such\nheavy in\ufb01ltrates in nonregressing papillomas and in uninfected\npalate, where many fewer lymphocytes can be detected. The\npresence of large numbers of lymphocytes does seem therefore\nto correlate with the regressing status of the lesions. A similar\nconclusion has been reached for regressing papillomas induced\nby cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (23) and for regressing gen-\nital condylomas in humans (6). In both cases, regressing lesions\nwere in\ufb01ltrated by lymphocytes, which were much more nu-\nmerous than in noninfected epithelium or nonregressing le-\nsions. As in regressing cottontail rabbit papillomavirus warts\n(23), the lymphocytes in regressing BPV-4 papillomas were not\nproliferating, suggesting that their activation and expansion\ntake place elsewhere.\nIn regressing BPV-4 papillomas, there were discernible dif-\nferences in the types of lymphocytes that populated different\nregions of the lesions. The predominant subtype of T lympho-\ncyte in these papillomas was by far the CD41 cell. The great\nmajority of CD41 cells were present in the subepithelial\nderma, where they often formed clusters. Some CD41 cells\nwere also located interdigitating with the cells of the basal and\nsuprabasal layers, but in these regions, CD81 and gd(WC11)\nlymphocytes were more prominent. In one papilloma, the\nCD81 lymphocytes were found among the highly differentiated\nfrond keratinocytes, adjacent to the keratin layer. This differ-\nential distribution would suggest that either CD41 lympho-\ncytes are less able than other lymphocyte subtypes to migrate\nacross the basal cell layer and into the body of the papilloma or\nthat CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes are speci\ufb01cally at-\ntracted into the suprabasal layers. Since CD81 lymphocytes are\ngenerally regarded as the major cytolytic cells, their proximity\nTABLE 1.

Lymphocytes were also found among the differ-\nentiated keratinocytes in regressing cottontail rabbit papillo-\nmavirus papillomas, but their phenotype was not established\n(23). In regressing genital condylomas in humans, large num-\nbers of CD41 and CD81 cells are found within both the stroma\nand the surface epithelium of the lesion, but gd lymphocytes\nwere not investigated (6). The preponderance of CD41 cells\nlead to the suggestion that regression of genital warts was\nmediated by CD41 lymphocytes and was probably due to a\ndelayed-type hypersensitivity response (6), in analogy to what\nwas previously observed in experimental systems (4, 21) and in\nrabbits with regressing papillomas (11). Also in regressing\nBPV-4 papillomas, the massive recruitment of CD41 lympho-\ncytes in the subbasal derma, and occasionally intraepithelially,\npoints to an important involvement of these cells in regression.\nRuminants have large amounts of gd lymphocytes both as\nnewborns and as adults (10). These cells are particularly prom-\nFIG. 3. Lymphocyte subtypes in a cell cluster in subbasal space of papilloma 78/P2.

They appear to have multiple roles (17): they can rec-\nognize antigen independently of major histocompatibility com-\nplex restriction (25), appear to be involved in delayed-type\nhypersensitivity responses (7), provide surveillance functions\nagainst microbes (14), and recently have been implicated in the\nmaintenance of epithelial integrity (18). In regressing BPV-4\npapillomas, gd(WC11) lymphocytes are found in even larger\nnumbers than CD81 cells and in the same location, although\nthey do not appear to migrate as far into the papilloma fronds\nas the latter. They are also more numerous than CD81 lym-\nphocytes in noninfected palate. It is not known what their role\nmay be in papilloma regression, but their recruitment into\nregressing lesions suggests that they may take part in the re-\ngression process, as suggested also by Hall et al. (9) in the case\nof bovine skin papillomas regressing after intralesional immu-\nnotherapy. Further investigation is needed to establish this\npoint.\nLarger clusters of lymphocytes are often found in the sub-\nbasal derma; all three subtypes of lymphocytes are found in the\nclusters, but intriguingly, CD41 cells, the most numerous, ap-\npear to position themselves in the middle of the cluster,\nwhereas CD81 and gd(WC11) cells position themselves at the\nperiphery. The signi\ufb01cance, if any, of this is unknown. In three\ncases of the present series of regressing papillomas, the integ-\nrity of the basal cell layer appeared destroyed and the lympho-\ncyte cluster, including CD41 cells, had penetrated into the\nsuprabasal layers of the papilloma. This situation may repre-\nsent one of the last stages of tumor regression. It is interesting\nthat as long as the basal layer maintains its integrity, very few\nCD41 lymphocytes are found within the keratinocytes, but\nonce the basal layer is breached, they migrate into the papil-\nloma in large numbers. The stimuli that trigger the clustering\nof lymphocytes in the subbasal space and the in\ufb01ltration of the\npapilloma are unknown.\nThe lymphocytes present in the papillomas are IL2-R1 and\nare therefore activated. Whether they are activated by viral\nantigens, and if so which one, or by cellular antigens is not\nknown. Heavy in\ufb01ltration of lymphocytes has been observed in\nboth BPV-2 and BPV-4 papillomas regressing after vaccination\nwith the viral proteins L2 and E7, respectively (2, 16). In\nE7-vaccinated calves, T lymphocytes showed a proliferative\nresponse to the E7 antigen when challenged in vitro, both\nbefore and during papilloma regression (20), suggesting that\nE7-speci\ufb01c T cells played a role in the regression process. In\nthat study, it was also found that in control nonvaccinated\nanimals, E7-speci\ufb01c T lymphocytes were detected only at the\nlast stages of papilloma development, before natural regres-\nsion, again suggesting an involvement of E7-speci\ufb01c T cells in\npapilloma regression.\nFurther analysis needs to be conducted to determine wheth-\ner the immunological mechanisms of natural rejection are sim-\nFIG. 4.

Our results for nat-\nurally regressing papillomas and those of Hall et al. (9) for\nimmunotherapy-treated regressing papillomas suggest that this\ncould indeed be the case.

Papilloma re-\ngression is deemed to be due to a cell-mediated immune response, the nature of which is still ill de\ufb01ned, and\nis accompanied by immune cell in\ufb01ltrates. To gain further information on the nature and role of the immune\ncells present in regressing papillomas, we have analyzed biopsies of papillomas induced in the soft palate of\ncattle by bovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) and have phenotypically characterized and quanti\ufb01ed the\nlymphocytes present in these lesions. Eleven papilloma biopsies and seven biopsies of noninfected palate were\nanalyzed for the presence of activated CD41, CD81, and gd(WC11) lymphocytes. We found large numbers of\nlymphocytes in the subepithelial derma of papillomas but not in normal palate tissue; these cellular masses\nconsisted predominantly of CD41 lymphocytes, with only a few CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes, generally\npositioned at the periphery of these masses. All three subtypes of lymphocytes were found interdigitated with\nthe cells of the basal layer both in papillomas and in normal palate tissue, but while basal layer CD81 and\ngd(WC11) T cells were detected with similar frequencies in papillomas and uninfected palate, basal layer\nCD41 T cells were much more frequent in papillomas. CD41, CD81, and gd(WC11) lymphocytes were found\nin the suprabasal layers of papillomas, but the CD81 and gd(WC11) T cells were more numerous and had\nmigrated further into the differentiating keratinocytes of the papilloma fronds than the CD41 T cells. We\nconclude that T-cell in\ufb01ltration is characteristic of regressing BPV-4 papillomas, that CD41 lymphocytes are\nspeci\ufb01cally and massively recruited into the regressing papillomas, and that although all three lymphocyte\nsubsets can penetrate the papilloma, only the CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes are able to migrate into the\nfronds. These results suggest that all three lymphocyte subsets have an important role to ful\ufb01ll during natural\nregression of papillomas.\nPapillomaviruses infect mucous and cutaneous epithelia and\ninduce hyperplastic lesions, de\ufb01ned as warts, papillomas, or\ncondylomas. These lesions are generally benign, but if they are\naccompanied by other cellular changes, often induced by ex-\nposure to environmental carcinogens, then cancers can de-\nvelop (13). Natural regression of papillomas has been found in\nhumans and animals (15, 19, 24, 27), and histological exami-\nnation of the regressing lesions has revealed marked in\ufb01ltra-\ntion of lymphocytes in both the epithelium and the dermis.\nExperimentally regression of papillomas can be induced in\nanimals by immunization with de\ufb01ned viral antigens (2, 16, 26),\nand also in these cases, regression is accompanied by in\ufb01ltrates\nof immune cells. These results, coupled with the observation\nthat papillomas and other papillomavirus-induced lesions do\nnot regress in individuals whose cellular immune responses are\ncompromised (1), strongly suggest that cellular immunity plays\nan important role in their regression. However the precise\nimmunological basis for the rejection of papillomas is still\npoorly understood.\nBovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) infects the mucous\nepithelium of upper alimentary canal of cattle and induces\nbenign papillomas which in immunocompetent animals are\nrejected approximately 1 year after the onset of infection (15). 1n cattle chronically immunosuppressed by a diet of bracken\nfern, the papillomas spread and persist and become a focus for\nneoplastic progression to squamous cell carcinomas (3), con-\n\ufb01rming that the integrity of the immune system is pivotal to the\nability of the host to undergo tumor rejection. Experimental\nrejection of BPV-4 papillomas has been achieved by immuniz-\ning cattle with the viral protein E7 (2), and the regressing\npapillomas showed in\ufb01ltrates of immune cells similar to those\nobserved in naturally regressing tumors.\nThe BPV-4 system is the most extensively studied animal\nmodel of mucosal papillomavirus infection applicable to the\nanogenital and respiratory epithelia in humans. As the immune\nmechanisms that control BPV-4 infection in cattle are likely to\nbe similar to those in humans, an investigation of the events\noccurring during BPV-4 papilloma rejection should shed light\non the rejection processes occurring in humans. To this end,\nwe have analyzed the lymphocyte populations in\ufb01ltrating nat-\nurally regressing BPV-4 papillomas, and here we report on\ntheir phenotype and distribution within the lesions.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAnimals and infection with BPV-4. Young calves (8 to 12 weeks old) were\ninfected in the soft palate by intradermal inoculation of 1011 particles of BPV-4\nin 10 sites (1010 particles per site) (2). The mouths were examined for lesions at\nintervals of 4 to 6 weeks. After approximately 32 weeks, papillomas that were\ndeemed to be undergoing rejection by macroscopic criteria were biopsied with\nthe underlying derma. Biopsies from the soft palate of control noninfected\nanimals were also taken.\nHistology. Biopsies were bisected; one half were snap-frozen by immersion in\nliquid nitrogen for immunocytochemical analysis, the other half were \ufb01xed in\nbuffered formalin for subsequent embedding in paraf\ufb01n wax. Paraf\ufb01n blocks were\nsectioned and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin.\n* Corresponding author.

Cryostat sections were cut from the snap-frozen pap-\nillomas, air dried, and then stored at 2208C. Sections were thawed and \ufb01xed in\nchilled acetone before being stained with the following monoclonal antibodies\n(MAbs): CC30 (anti-CD4), CC63 (anti-CD8) (12), CC15 (anti-WC1 antigen of\ngd T cells [5]), and 1LA-111 (anti-a-chain interleukin-2 receptor [IL2-R] [22]).\nPrior to use on cryosections, all of these MAbs were shown by \ufb02uorescence-\nactivated cell sorting to be reactive against bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes\n(not shown). MAbs were incubated with sections for 1 h at room temperature in\na moist chamber. Sections were then washed three times with phosphate-buff-\nered saline, and bound antibodies were revealed by using peroxidase-conjugated\nreagents from a Vector ABC Elite kit speci\ufb01c for mouse antibodies, with dia-\nminobenzidine as the chromogen. The tissue sections counterstained with eosin.\nHematoxylin-and-eosin staining of two sections cut at the begiming and end\nof each run of frozen sections was used for measuring area and length of\nepithelium.\nEnumeration of cell types. The sections of papillomas and uninfected palate\nwere divided into four regions: region 1, the subepithelial derma; region 2, the\nbasal cell layer; region 3, the invaginations of the derma into the body of the\npapilloma (this region is contiguous with the subbasal region de\ufb01ned as region\n1); and region 4, the area above the basal cell layer (excluding region 3), pri-\nmarily comprising differentiating keratinocytes. 1n many sections, \ufb01xed bound-\naries of region 1 were often dif\ufb01cult to de\ufb01ne, and the lymphocytes were too\nnumerous to count; therefore numerical data from this region were not gener-\nated. 1n serial sections, regions 2, 3, and 4 formed relatively constant areas in\nwhich to count CD41, CD81, gd(WC11), and 1L2-R1 lymphocytes, and there-\nfore quantitative data are provided for these regions. For each biopsy specimen,\nthe areas of regions 3 and 4 and the length of the basal cell layer were calculated\nfrom two sections that were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The microscope\nslides were screened in a slide scamer; the image was manipulated by using\nAdobe Photoshop and analyzed by using an NIH package. A microscope slide\nwith a 1-mm line etched on it was used to calibrate the images. For each\nspecimen, the mean of the two slides was taken. The densities for each type of\nlymphocyte are expressed as cell numbers per square millimeter in regions 3 and\n4 and as cell numbers per millimeter in region 2.\nStatistical analysis of lymphocyte counts. Differences in the density of CD41,\nCD81, and gd(WC11) lymphocytes among regions 2, 3, and 4 were analyzed by\nusing paired t tests. Paired t tests are appropriate because the comparisons are\nbased on individual differences in cell counts between two regions within the\nsame specimen. The paired differences were then combined for the papillomas or\nuninfected palatine biopsies. Differences in density of lymphocyte subtypes in a\nparticular region between the papillomas and the uninfected palate samples were\nanalyzed by using an unpaired t test.\nRESULTS\nEleven papillomas and seven control palate samples were\nstained with the panel of MAbs; only photographs from rep-\nresentative papillomas are presented.\nHistological analysis. Histological examination of the pap-\nilloma biopsies clearly demonstrated mononuclear in\ufb01ltrates in\nall of them. 1n some biopsies, the in\ufb01ltration was particularly\nsevere, with large masses of lymphocytes in the subbasal derma\n(Fig. 1A). 1n contrast, no in\ufb01ltrate was observed in nonregress-\ning papillomas (Fig. 1B) or in noninfected palate (see Fig. 5).\nDistribution of lymphocyte subtypes in regressing papillo-\nmas. 1n regressing papillomas, the CD41 lymphocytes were\npredominantly distributed in regions 1 (cell counts not given)\nand 3, that is, in the derma and its invaginations. Few CD41\nlymphocytes were present in the basal layer (region 2), inter-\ndigitated with the epithelial cells, and were only sporadically\nfound in region 4 (Fig. 2B and Table 1). CD81 lymphocytes\nwere also found in regions 1, 2, and 3 and in relatively large\nnumbers also in region 4, among the keratinocytes of the su-\nprabasal layers (Fig. 2C and F and Table 1). The pattern of\ngd(WC11) lymphocytes distribution was similar to that of\nCD81 lymphocytes (Fig. 2D and Table 1). 1n contrast to the epithelial cells of the basal layers of the\npapilloma, the great majority of lymphocytes was negative for\nKi-67, a MAb speci\ufb01c for a nuclear antigen associated with cell\nproliferation (8) (Fig. 2E), indicating that the lymphocytes\nwere not proliferating in situ.\nThe mean densities of each type of lymphocyte in regions 2,\n3, and 4 are shown in Table 1. Within region 1, there was a\nlarger population of CD41 than of CD81 cells; although these\ncells were too numerous to count, this conclusion is con\ufb01rmed\nby the greater density of CD41 than of CD81 cells in region 3,\nwhich is contiguous with region 1. There were no signi\ufb01cant\ndifferences in the numbers of CD41 and CD81 cells within the\nbasal cell layer (region 2). 1n region 4, there were signi\ufb01cantly\nhigher densities of CD81 than of CD41 cells. The densities of\ngd(WC11) lymphocytes in regions 2, 3, and 4 were generally\nhigher than those of CD81 lymphocytes. The P values for these\ndifferences are shown in Table 2. 1n some papillomas, there were large foci of lymphocytes\nsituated either just beneath or straddling the basal cell layer.\nAlthough within each focus the densities of cells were too great\nto allow precise counts, it was obvious that the overwhelming\nmajority of cells consisted of CD41 lymphocytes (Fig. 3A).\nCD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes were also present, although\nthey were not evenly distributed within the cluster of CD41\ncells but restricted to the fringes of each focus (Fig. 3B and C). 1n two cases, as illustrated by papilloma 331/P1 in Fig. 4, these\nclusters of lymphocytes appeared to destroy the integrity of the\nbasal cell layer and to in\ufb01ltrate deep in the papilloma.\nDistribution of lymphocyte subtypes in uninfected palate.\nThe distribution and mean densities of lymphocytes in unin-\nfected palatine biopsies are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. There\nwere no appreciable lymphocyte deposits in the subepithelial\nderma. There were signi\ufb01cantly higher densities of CD81 than\nof CD41 cells in regions 2 and 4, and the gd(WC11) lympho-\ncytes were more numerous than CD41 cells in all regions\nand more numerous than CD81 cells in regions 2 and 3. The\nP values for the observed differences are shown in Table 2.\nFIG. 1. Hematoxylin-and-eosin staining of histological sections of regressing papilloma 78/P2 (A) and a nonregressing papilloma (B).

A comparison of the mean\ndensities of lymphocytes between regressing papillomas and\nuninfected palatine biopsies is shown with P values in Table 1.\nThe major differences in lymphocyte densities were found in\nregion 1, where no large deposits were seen in normal palatine\nbiopsies, and in region 4, where the densities of CD41, CD81,\nand gd(WC11) lymphocytes were signi\ufb01cantly higher in pap-\nillomas than in the uninfected palates. 1n regions 2 and 3, only\nthe densities of CD41 cells in papillomas exceeded that of\nuninfected palates, and there were no signi\ufb01cant differences in\nthe number of CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes in these\nregions.\nCD41, CD81, and gd1 lymphocytes express 1L2-R. Acti-\nvated lymphocytes express the a and b chains of 1L2-R (28).\nTo establish the state of activation of the lymphocyte subtypes\nin papillomas, sections were stained with MAb 1LA-111, which\nspeci\ufb01cally recognizes the a chain of 1L2-R.

First,\nthe ability to detect individual types of lymphocytes on sequen-\ntial sections was investigated. For one specimen, three sequen-\ntial sections were stained for CD41, CD81, and gd(WC11)\nlymphocytes (nine slides in all). Sections were photographed,\nand the positions of a minimum of 25 individual lymphocytes\n(often more if heavily in\ufb01ltrated) in the \ufb01rst section were\nnoted; these positions were then checked in the second and\nthird sections. The percentages detected for CD41, CD81, and\ngd(WC11) were 75, 60, and 82, respectively, in the second\nsection and 25, 24, and 26, respectively, in the third section.\nHaving veri\ufb01ed that most lymphocytes could be identi\ufb01ed in\npairs of serial sections, these sections were stained with 1LA-\n111 and either CC30 (IL2-R1 and CD41), CC63 (IL2-R1 and\nCD81), or CC15 [IL2-R1 and gd(WC11)]. Many lymphocytes\nin all regions of the papillomas, including the large foci in the\nsubepithelial derma, expressed 1L2-R (Fig. 3D and 4D and\nTable 1). 1L2-R1 lymphocytes were counted in regions 2 and 4.\nForty percent of CD41, 33% of CD81, and 62% of gd(WC11)\nlymphocytes were 1L2-R1, indicating that, allowing for the\npercentage of cells detected in the second section, approxi-\nmately half of CD41 and CD81 lymphocytes and three-quar-\nters of gd(WC11) lymphocytes expressed 1L2-R and were\ntherefore activated. 1n one papilloma, the lymphocytes ap-\npeared to be 1L2-R2; the signi\ufb01cance of this is not understood. 1n contrast to papillomas in which 1L2-R1 lymphocytes were\nfound in all areas, in normal palatine biopsies only lympho-\ncytes in region 2 were 1L2-R1 (Table 1).\nDISCUSSION\nNatural regression of papillomavirus-induced tumors is ac-\ncompanied by marked in\ufb01ltration of lymphocytes (6, 15, 23, 24,\n27). Similar in\ufb01ltrates have been observed in papillomas re-\ngressing as a result of either vaccination (16) or intralesion\nimmunotherapy with Corynebacterium parvum (9). The precise\nmechanism of rejection is not known, nor is it known whether\nthe lymphocytes are activated against viral or cellular antigens,\nalthough in the case of vaccine-induced regression, lympho-\ncytes proliferate in vitro in response to the immunizing viral\nantigen (20).\nAs part of our investigations into the mechanisms of papil-\nloma rejection in the BPV-4 system, we have analyzed the\nphenotype of the T lymphocytes in\ufb01ltrating naturally regress-\ning papillomas. We have repeatedly observed that natural re-\ngression of upper alimentary canal papillomas starts approxi-\nmately 8 to 12 months after infection. 1ndeed, papillomas that\nwere deemed to have entered rejection by visual inspection\nwere shown by histopathological analysis to be massively in\ufb01l-\ntrated by immune cells. This contrasts with the absence of such\nheavy in\ufb01ltrates in nonregressing papillomas and in uninfected\npalate, where many fewer lymphocytes can be detected. The\npresence of large numbers of lymphocytes does seem therefore\nto correlate with the regressing status of the lesions. A similar\nconclusion has been reached for regressing papillomas induced\nby cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (23) and for regressing gen-\nital condylomas in humans (6). 1n both cases, regressing lesions\nwere in\ufb01ltrated by lymphocytes, which were much more nu-\nmerous than in noninfected epithelium or nonregressing le-\nsions. As in regressing cottontail rabbit papillomavirus warts\n(23), the lymphocytes in regressing BPV-4 papillomas were not\nproliferating, suggesting that their activation and expansion\ntake place elsewhere. 1n regressing BPV-4 papillomas, there were discernible dif-\nferences in the types of lymphocytes that populated different\nregions of the lesions. The predominant subtype of T lympho-\ncyte in these papillomas was by far the CD41 cell. The great\nmajority of CD41 cells were present in the subepithelial\nderma, where they often formed clusters. Some CD41 cells\nwere also located interdigitating with the cells of the basal and\nsuprabasal layers, but in these regions, CD81 and gd(WC11)\nlymphocytes were more prominent. 1n one papilloma, the\nCD81 lymphocytes were found among the highly differentiated\nfrond keratinocytes, adjacent to the keratin layer. This differ-\nential distribution would suggest that either CD41 lympho-\ncytes are less able than other lymphocyte subtypes to migrate\nacross the basal cell layer and into the body of the papilloma or\nthat CD81 and gd(WC11) lymphocytes are speci\ufb01cally at-\ntracted into the suprabasal layers. Since CD81 lymphocytes are\ngenerally regarded as the major cytolytic cells, their proximity\nTABLE 1.

Lymphocytes were also found among the differ-\nentiated keratinocytes in regressing cottontail rabbit papillo-\nmavirus papillomas, but their phenotype was not established\n(23). 1n regressing genital condylomas in humans, large num-\nbers of CD41 and CD81 cells are found within both the stroma\nand the surface epithelium of the lesion, but gd lymphocytes\nwere not investigated (6). The preponderance of CD41 cells\nlead to the suggestion that regression of genital warts was\nmediated by CD41 lymphocytes and was probably due to a\ndelayed-type hypersensitivity response (6), in analogy to what\nwas previously observed in experimental systems (4, 21) and in\nrabbits with regressing papillomas (11). Also in regressing\nBPV-4 papillomas, the massive recruitment of CD41 lympho-\ncytes in the subbasal derma, and occasionally intraepithelially,\npoints to an important involvement of these cells in regression.\nRuminants have large amounts of gd lymphocytes both as\nnewborns and as adults (10). These cells are particularly prom-\nFIG. 3. Lymphocyte subtypes in a cell cluster in subbasal space of papilloma 78/P2.

They appear to have multiple roles (17): they can rec-\nognize antigen independently of major histocompatibility com-\nplex restriction (25), appear to be involved in delayed-type\nhypersensitivity responses (7), provide surveillance functions\nagainst microbes (14), and recently have been implicated in the\nmaintenance of epithelial integrity (18). 1n regressing BPV-4\npapillomas, gd(WC11) lymphocytes are found in even larger\nnumbers than CD81 cells and in the same location, although\nthey do not appear to migrate as far into the papilloma fronds\nas the latter. They are also more numerous than CD81 lym-\nphocytes in noninfected palate. 1t is not known what their role\nmay be in papilloma regression, but their recruitment into\nregressing lesions suggests that they may take part in the re-\ngression process, as suggested also by Hall et al. (9) in the case\nof bovine skin papillomas regressing after intralesional immu-\nnotherapy. Further investigation is needed to establish this\npoint.\nLarger clusters of lymphocytes are often found in the sub-\nbasal derma; all three subtypes of lymphocytes are found in the\nclusters, but intriguingly, CD41 cells, the most numerous, ap-\npear to position themselves in the middle of the cluster,\nwhereas CD81 and gd(WC11) cells position themselves at the\nperiphery. The signi\ufb01cance, if any, of this is unknown. 1n three\ncases of the present series of regressing papillomas, the integ-\nrity of the basal cell layer appeared destroyed and the lympho-\ncyte cluster, including CD41 cells, had penetrated into the\nsuprabasal layers of the papilloma. This situation may repre-\nsent one of the last stages of tumor regression. 1t is interesting\nthat as long as the basal layer maintains its integrity, very few\nCD41 lymphocytes are found within the keratinocytes, but\nonce the basal layer is breached, they migrate into the papil-\nloma in large numbers. The stimuli that trigger the clustering\nof lymphocytes in the subbasal space and the in\ufb01ltration of the\npapilloma are unknown.\nThe lymphocytes present in the papillomas are 1L2-R1 and\nare therefore activated. Whether they are activated by viral\nantigens, and if so which one, or by cellular antigens is not\nknown. Heavy in\ufb01ltration of lymphocytes has been observed in\nboth BPV-2 and BPV-4 papillomas regressing after vaccination\nwith the viral proteins L2 and E7, respectively (2, 16). 1n\nE7-vaccinated calves, T lymphocytes showed a proliferative\nresponse to the E7 antigen when challenged in vitro, both\nbefore and during papilloma regression (20), suggesting that\nE7-speci\ufb01c T cells played a role in the regression process. 1n\nthat study, it was also found that in control nonvaccinated\nanimals, E7-speci\ufb01c T lymphocytes were detected only at the\nlast stages of papilloma development, before natural regres-\nsion, again suggesting an involvement of E7-speci\ufb01c T cells in\npapilloma regression.\nFurther analysis needs to be conducted to determine wheth-\ner the immunological mechanisms of natural rejection are sim-\nFIG. 4.

Our results for nat-\nurally regressing papillomas and those of Hall et al. (9) for\nimmunotherapy-treated regressing papillomas suggest that this\ncould indeed be the case.

Kar,1 and Manoranjan Ranjit1*\nRegional Medical Research Centre (ICMR), Bhubaneswar 751023, Orissa, 1ndia,1 and SCB Medical College & Hospital,\nCuttack 753007, Orissa, 1ndia2\nReceived 22 January 2009/Returned for modi\ufb01cation 2 March 2009/Accepted 1 April 2009\nTo explore the hypothesis that susceptibility to cerebral malaria is in\ufb02uenced by genetic variation in\nendothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), we genotyped three commonly de\ufb01ned polymorphic loci of eNOS,\nGlu2983Asp, intron 4 variable number of tandem repeat region, and T-7863C, in 244 patients (mean age, 36.2\nyears) with mild malaria and 194 patients (mean age, 35.6 years) with severe malaria belonging to same ethnic\ngroup in Orissa, an eastern 1ndian state. We found that there was an association of the Glu2983Asp\nsubstitution (P \u0001 0.0037; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% con\ufb01dence interval, 1.2 to 3.0) and a single unique haplotype\nde\ufb01ned by \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d (Pcorrected \u0001 0.0024) for protection against cerebral malaria. Further, the median plasma\nlevel of nitrite-nitrate was found to be increased in individuals with the Glu2983Asp substitution and was\nsigni\ufb01cantly higher in the mild malaria group (P < 0.0001), but the increase was not signi\ufb01cant in the severe\nmalaria group (P \u0001 0.0528). These \ufb01ndings suggest that the Glu2983Asp substitution and the \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d\nhaplotype may enhance eNOS expression and NO production, which leads to protection against cerebral\nmalaria. These \ufb01ndings may increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of malaria.\nMalaria parasites are major human pathogens that annually\nare associated with 300 million to 500 million clinical cases\nworldwide and 1 million to 3 million deaths (2). Despite high\ninfection rates, only 1% to 2% of malaria patients develop\nlife-threatening complications, such as cerebral malaria and\nprofound anemia, so natural selection has likely operated, to a\nlarge extent, on severity (11). This has prompted the search for\nfactors involved in natural resistance to severe malaria. The\nseverity of malaria depends largely upon the capacity of Plas-\nmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (RBCs) to adhere to\nthe endothelia of microvessels (cytoadherence) and to form\nrosettes with uninfected RBCs (14). This results in a high\nparasite burden and severe proin\ufb02ammatory responses in lo-\ncalized areas, leading to endothelial damage and organ dys-\nfunction (7). Further, upregulation of endothelial cell adhesion\nmolecules in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha poten-\ntially augments the cytoadherence (22). However, in recent\nstudies, increased NO production has been shown to be ben-\ne\ufb01cial because of its antiparasitic and antidisease effect, al-\nthough this is controversial, (1). This effect is due to inhibition\nof the cytoadherence process through downregulation of the\nexpression of 1CAM1, VCAM1, and E-selectin, which are in-\nvolved in cytoadherence and microvascular sequestration of\nparasitized RBCs (18) and decreased production of tumor\nnecrosis factor by macrophages (9). NO is produced during the\nenzymatic conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by three iso-\nforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), namely inducible NOS,\nendothelial NOS (eNOS), and neuronal NOS (19). The eNOS-\nderived NO mediates vasodilation, inhibits platelet aggrega-\ntion and endothelial cell activation, and modulates expression\nof cell adhesion molecules (12). Further, endothelial dysfunc-\ntion in malaria is nearly universal when the disease is severe, is\nreversible with L-arginine, and likely contributes to pathogen-\nesis (27). Therefore, we hypothesized that functionally impor-\ntant variants of eNOS could in\ufb02uence individual susceptibility\nto malaria by altering the amount of NO generated by the\nendothelium.\nThe eNOS is constitutively expressed by vascular endothe-\nlium, and its gene is assigned to chromosome 7. This gene\ncontains 26 exons spanning \u000221 kb of genomic DNA and\nencodes an mRNA with 4,052 nucleotides, and a single copy is\npresent in the haploid genome (13). Several allelic variants of\nthe eNOS gene have been identi\ufb01ed, and a variant with a T/C\nsubstitution in the 5\u0003 \ufb02anking region near the promoter at\nposition \u0004786, a variant with a 27-bp variable number of tan-\ndem repeat (VNTR) region in intron 4, and a variant with a\nG/T substitution at position 894 in exon 7 that codes for re-\nplacement of glutamic acid by aspartic acid at residue 298 in\nthe mature eNOS protein, which together span \u00026.2 kb in the\nhuman genome, have been determined to be clinically impor-\ntant for several diseases. However, the mechanisms by which\nthese genetic variants can affect eNOS enzyme activity have\nnot been demonstrated. 1mpaired NO production as a result of\nthe polymorphism in exon 7 (8) and lower serum nitrite-nitrate\n(NOx) levels due to the \u0004786C variant have been observed (4,\n15). The VNTR polymorphism in intron 4 of eNOS (eNOS4b/a\npolymorphism) has been reported to be signi\ufb01cantly associated\nwith the plasma NOx concentration (25) and affects the tran-\nscription ef\ufb01ciency in a haplotype-speci\ufb01c fashion in linkage\ndisequilibrium with the T-786C polymorphism in the promoter\nregion (23). To the best of our knowledge, no other coding or\nfunctional variants in this region which impair endothelial NO\nproduction have been reported so far. Moreover, because of\ndifferent gene pools, lifestyles, and gene-environment interac-\n* Corresponding author.

Malaria is considered to be hyper-\nendemic in this state, and transmission occurs throughout the year, with a\nseasonal peak from July to October. All four species of human malaria organisms\nare found in Orissa, but \u000585% of all clinical malaria is due to P. falciparum (16.).\nPatients who were clinically suspected to have malaria were screened for P.\nfalciparum infection using both thick and thin \ufb01lm methods. The severity of\nmalaria was classi\ufb01ed using the de\ufb01nitions and associated characteristics de-\nscribed by the World Health Organization (26). The following criteria were used\nto identify uncomplicated malaria cases: an axillary temperature of \u000537.5\u00b0C or\nsymptoms of headache, fever, and myalgia, no schizontemia, no intake of anti-\nmalarial drugs in the preceding week, and no history of hospitalization (to\nexclude individuals who had already had a severe malarial attack). The criteria\nused for cerebral malaria cases were an unarousable coma for \u00056 h after severe\nconvulsions and no indication of other causes of cerebral involvement and an\naxillary temperature of \u000537.5\u00b0C. The criteria used for exclusion were (i) a\ncon\ufb01rmed diagnosis of coinfection with other Plasmodium species; (ii) symptoms\nof mild or severe malaria with other acute infections, including intestinal geo-\nhelminthic infections; (iii) chronic diseases like tuberculosis, leprosy, and mal-\nnutrition; (iv) genetic disorders like hemoglobinopathies and glucose-6-phos-\nphate dehydrogenase de\ufb01ciency; and (v) pregnancy, smokers, patients with\ncoronary artery diseases, and diabetes mellitus. Venous blood was collected in\nEDTA-containing vials after informed consent was obtained from all enrolled\npatients (patients with mild malaria as well as patients with severe malaria) and\nimmediately centrifuged at 1,000 \u0006 g for 3 min. Plasma aliquots were then\nremoved and stored at \u000470\u00b0C. Each patient was treated according to local\nguidelines, and care was provided until the patient was discharged from the\nhospital. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Regional\nMedical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar, 1ndia.\nDNA isolation and genotyping. Human genomic DNA was puri\ufb01ed from 200\n\u0007l of blood using the standard protocol (17). 1n brief, blood cells were lysed with\nlysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCI [pH 8.0], 0.1 M EDTA [pH 8.0], 0.5% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate, 20 \u0007g/ml pancreatic RNase) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, and then proteinase\nK (100 \u0007g/ml) was added and the lysate was incubated at 54\u00b0C for 3 h. DNA was\nobtained by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and then\nresuspended in 50 \u0007l of DNase-free water. The T3C transition at position \u0004786\nin the 5\u0003 \ufb02anking region of the eNOS gene was investigated by performing\nPCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using forward primer\n5\u0003-ATGCTCCCACCAGGGCATCA-3\u0003 and reverse primer 5\u0003-GTCCTTGAGT\nCTGACATTAGGG-3\u0003. The PCR fragment (236 bp) was digested with the\nNgOAIV restriction enzyme overnight at 37\u00b0C. The wild-type sequence (\u0004786T)\nwas not cut, whereas the mutant sequence (\u0004786C) was cleaved into two frag-\nments (203 and 33 bp). Genotyping of the Glu2983Asp polymorphism was done\nby PCR amplifying exon 7 using sense primer 5\u0003-CATGAGGCTCAGCCCCA\nGAAC-3\u0003 and antisense primer 5\u0003-AGTCAATCCCTTTGGTGCTCAC-3\u0003, fol-\nlowed by digestion with the MboI restriction enzyme overnight at 37\u00b0C (6). 1n the\npresence of a T at position 894, which corresponds to Asp298, the 206-bp PCR\nproduct was cleaved into two fragments (119 and 87 bp). The restriction enzyme-\ndigested products were separated by electrophoresis on 3% Neusive agarose and\nvisualized by ethidium bromide (0.5 \u0007g/ml) staining. The intron 4 VNTR poly-\nmorphism of the eNOS gene was detected by the method of Wang et al. (24),\nwith a slight modi\ufb01cation (28). Brie\ufb02y, DNA samples were ampli\ufb01ed by PCR\nusing sense (5\u0003-AGGCCCTAGGTAGTGCCTTT-3\u0003) and antisense (5\u0003-TCTCT\nTAGTGCT GTGGTAC-3\u0003) primers that \ufb02anked the region containing the\n27-bp direct repeat of the intron 4 VNTR. The ampli\ufb01ed DNAs were separated\non 3% Neusive agarose and visualized by ethidium bromide (0.5 \u0007g/ml) staining.\nTo ensure that there was no error in genotyping, about 10% of the randomly\nselected samples were regenotyped for intron 4 VNTR and T-7863C substitu-\ntion, whereas genotyping for the Glu2983Asp substitution was repeated for all of\nthe samples and the results were found to be 100% concordant.\nPlasma NOx assay. Plasma samples from patients with acute renal failure and\npatients who were taking medications, such as long-acting nitrates (sorbitate),\nwere excluded from the study as these factors would have interfered with plasma\nNOx measurement. Plasma from patients who had consumed low-nitrate food\n12 h before blood was collected were included, and to eliminate the possibility of\nnitrate contamination of EDTA tubes, the tubes were prewashed with Aqua Max\n(Younglin, South Korea) water. 1n addition, the EDTA solution that we used\nhad undetectable levels of nitrite. Plasma NO3\n\u0004 plus NO2\n\u0004 (NOx) was measured\nby measuring NO2\n\u0004 after enzymatic conversion of NO3\n\u0004 to NO2\n\u0004 by nitrate\nreductase in duplicate according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using a com-\nmercial method (R&D Systems, Minnesota).\nStatistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad\nPrism (version 4.0). The association of genotypes and allele frequencies between\nthe two clinical groups was determined by computing the odds ratio derived from\na \b2 test. The \b2 test was also used to test the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\nStatistical signi\ufb01cance was de\ufb01ned as a P value of \t0.05. Linkage disequilibrium\nwas examined by \b2 analysis, and the extent of disequilibrium was determined as\nfollows: D\u0003 \n D/Dmax. The SNP Alyze program (version 7.0), which uses the\nexpectation maximization algorithm, was used to estimate the maximum likeli-\nhood of haplotype frequencies in each group, and to identify which speci\ufb01c\nhaplotypes were associated with a clinical outcome of malaria, a P value of\n\t0.00625 (0.05/number of haplotypes) was considered signi\ufb01cant to correct for\nthe number of comparisons made. The plasma NOx levels were compared by\nusing the Mann-Whitney U test.\nRESULTS\nA total of 244 patients (mean age, 36.2 years) with mild\nmalaria and 194 patients (mean age, 35.6 years) with severe\nmalaria were enrolled in this study. All referred patients were\nnatives of Orissa, had permanent resident status, and belonged\nto the Hindu population. 1n the severe malaria group, all the\npatients had cerebral malaria. Of these, 6.7% had hyperpara-\nsitemia (\u000525,000 parasites/\u0007l), 20.1% had scizontemia, 32%\nhad generalized convulsions, and 85% had jaundice (Table 1).\nExcept for the Glu2983Asp substitution, which showed signif-\nicant deviation in the mild malaria group of patients (\b2 \n 5.5,\nP \t 0.05), the genotypic distribution of all the polymorphic loci\nstudied here showed no deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg\nTABLE 1.

The Glu2983Asp polymorphism was observed\nmore frequently in the group of patients with mild malaria than\nin the group of patients with severe malaria. When the geno-\ntype and allele frequencies for the three polymorphic sites of\nthe eNOS gene (Glu2983Asp, intron 4 VNTR, and T-7863C)\nwere compared for the groups of patients with mild and severe\nmalaria,\na\nsigni\ufb01cant\ndifference\nwas\nobserved\nonly\nfor\nGlu2983Asp polymorphism (Table 2). Further, comparison of\nthe allele and haplotype frequencies revealed that the eNOS\nT-7863C polymorphism was strongly and signi\ufb01cantly (D\u0003 \n0.74, P \t 0.0001) linked to the intron 4 VNTR a/b polymor-\nphism, with the \u201c4a\u201d allele preferentially found in a subgroup\nof individuals with at least one \u201cC-786C\u201d allele. 1nterestingly,\nwhen the overall frequency distributions for all eight eNOS\nhaplotypes were compared for the groups with mild and severe\nmalaria, the H8 haplotype (C-b-Asp) was found to be more\ncommon in the group of patients with mild malaria than in the\ngroup of patients with severe malaria (P \n 0.0003, Bonferroni\ncorrection; 0.0003 multiplied by the number of haplotypes,\nPcorrected \n 0.0024) (Fig. 1). Further, the median plasma level\nof NOx was found to be higher in individuals with the\nGlu2983Asp substitution and was signi\ufb01cantly higher in the\nmild malaria group (P \u0001 0.0001), but the increase was not\nsigni\ufb01cant (Table 3) in the severe malaria group (P \n 0.0528).\nNo differences were observed in plasma NOx concentrations\naccording to gender or age.\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study was the \ufb01rst study to evaluate and com-\npare the distributions of eNOS genotypes and haplotypes in\npatients with mild malaria and patients with severe malaria. To\nexplore the hypothesis that susceptibility to cerebral malaria is\nin\ufb02uenced by genetic variation in eNOS, we genotyped three\ncommonly de\ufb01ned polymorphic loci of eNOS, Glu2983Asp,\nintron 4 VNTR, and T-7863C. We found an association for\nthe Glu2983Asp substitution (P \n 0.0037) and a single hap-\nlotype uniquely de\ufb01ned by \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d (Pcorrected \n 0.0024) for\nprotection against cerebral malaria, even though its frequency\nis about 3% in the population studied. Further, the increased\nmedian plasma NOx level in individuals with the Glu2983Asp\nsubstitution and its signi\ufb01cant association with the mild ma-\nlaria group (P \u0001 0.0001) but not with the severe malaria group\n(P \n 0.0528) suggest that the Glu2983Asp substitution and the\n\u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype may enhance eNOS expression and NO\nproduction, which leads to protection against cerebral malaria,\nalthough an association of the plasma NOx level with different\nhaplotypes could not be established due to the low frequency\nof some of the haplotypes as a small number of patients were\nselected for measurement of plasma NOx levels.\nThere have been few studies of the speci\ufb01c association be-\ntween the genetic polymorphisms of eNOS and plasma NOx\nconcentrations in different diseases. To date, there is no clear\nevidence for impaired NO production as a result of the G/T\npolymorphism in exon 7 that codes for replacement of glutamic\nacid by aspartic acid at residue 298 in the mature eNOS protein\n(8).The Glu2983Asp change has been suggested to increase\nthe susceptibility to cleavage of the eNOS enzyme (20) and\nhence result in low levels of NO production. Other workers\nargue that cleavage is due to in vitro acidic hydrolysis during\nsample preparation and does not appear to in\ufb02uence the sta-\nbility, half-life, or biologic activity of the enzyme (8). However,\na relationship between increased plasma NOx levels and poly-\nmorphisms in the eNOS gene has been observed for the\nGlu2983Asp mutation (28). Studies examining the functional-\nity of T-786C have focused on eNOS expression. Lower eNOS\nFIG. 1.

FALCIPARUM 1NFECTION\n2945\n\nmRNA and serum NOx levels have been found in individuals\nwith the \u0004786C variant (15). However, an investigation by\nHassan et al. (10) showed that in subjects with the C/C geno-\ntype, the levels of nitrates in the blood serum were higher than\nthe levels in subjects with the T/T genotype of the eNOS gene\npromoter. Given the intron location of the intron 4 repeating\nunit, it is less likely to be functional. Some reports indicate that\nindividuals with intron 4 VNTR polymorphism have lower\nplasma NO levels and exhibit decreased protein expression\n(21). However, this \ufb01nding is not supported by all studies, and\nin healthy Caucasians an association between homozygosity for\nthe 4a allele in the eNOS gene and increased plasma NOx\nlevels has been detected (25). However, many epidemiological\nstudies at the population and tissue levels support the possi-\nbility that T-786C and the 27-bp repeat in intron 4, which are\nin close linkage disequilibrium, may function in quantitative\neNOS regulation. A recent study by Wang et al. (23) shows\nthat the 27-bp repeat from eNOS intron 4 has a cis-regulating\neffect on the eNOS promoter and appears to be haplotype\ndependent. The highest transcription activity level was found\nfor the eNOS promoter in the presence of the \u201c\u0004786C\u201d (mu-\ntant) allele in the promoter and the \u201cb\u201d allele for intron 4,\nwhich are precisely the alleles included in the protective H8\nhaplotype in the present study. Furthermore, the increased\nmedian plasma NOx levels in individuals with the Glu2983Asp\nsubstitution and the signi\ufb01cant association of this substitution\nwith the mild malaria group (P \n 0.0001) but not with the\nsevere\nmalaria\ngroup\n(P\n\n0.0528)\nsuggest\nthat\nthe\nGlu2983Asp substitution and the \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype may be\nassociated with increased eNOS expression and NO produc-\ntion, leading to protection against cerebral malaria. The de-\ncrease in the overall frequency of the \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype in\nthis population may be due to linkage disequilibrium of the\n\u201cC-786C\u201d allele and the \u201ca\u201d allele of intron 4 VNTR. More-\nover, the deviation of the Glu2983Asp substitution from Har-\ndy-Weinberg equilibrium only in patients with mild malaria\nre\ufb02ects the possibility that this locus is under selection pres-\nsure. 1t is not known whether Asp298 allele polymorphism\nunderlies the functional characteristics of the \u201cC-b\u201d haplotype.\nTo determine whether the Glu2983Asp substitution in\ufb02uences\nthe plasma NOx level with the \u201cC-b\u201d haplotype, gene expres-\nsion analysis and protein production are necessary. The geno-\ntypic distribution of Asp298 and \u0004786C homozygous in our\npopulation (0.45% and 1.8%, respectively), which best \ufb01ts the\nAsian-type distribution (3), shows that studies with very large\nsample sizes are needed to obtain reliable estimates of the\neffect of these polymorphisms in our populations. 1n\nconclusion,\nour\n\ufb01ndings\nsuggest\nthat\nthe\neNOS\nGlu2983Asp substitution and \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype have pro-\ntective effects against cerebral malaria and that the presence of\nAsp at position 298 may in\ufb02uence eNOS expression and NO\nproduction by the \u201cC-b\u201d haplotype. To evaluate the exact re-\nlationship between the eNOS polymorphisms and plasma NOx,\nit is necessary to explore and clarify the putative effects of the\nGlu2983Asp, T-786C, and intron 4 VNTR polymorphisms in-\ndividually and in combination on endothelial NO production\nand its function in terms of risk for malaria in different popu-\nlations where malaria is endemic.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the 1ndian Council of Medical Research, New\nDelhi, for \ufb01nancial support.

We found that there was an association of the Glu2983Asp\nsubstitution (P \u0001 0.0037; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% con\ufb01dence interval, 1.2 to 3.0) and a single unique haplotype\nde\ufb01ned by \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d (Pcorrected \u0001 0.0024) for protection against cerebral malaria. Further, the median plasma\nlevel of nitrite-nitrate was found to be increased in individuals with the Glu2983Asp substitution and was\nsigni\ufb01cantly higher in the mild malaria group (P < 0.0001), but the increase was not signi\ufb01cant in the severe\nmalaria group (P \u0001 0.0528). These \ufb01ndings suggest that the Glu2983Asp substitution and the \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d\nhaplotype may enhance eNOS expression and NO production, which leads to protection against cerebral\nmalaria. These \ufb01ndings may increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of malaria.\nMalaria parasites are major human pathogens that amually\nare associated with 300 million to 500 million clinical cases\nworldwide and 1 million to 3 million deaths (2). Despite high\ninfection rates, only 1% to 2% of malaria patients develop\nlife-threatening complications, such as cerebral malaria and\nprofound anemia, so natural selection has likely operated, to a\nlarge extent, on severity (11). This has prompted the search for\nfactors involved in natural resistance to severe malaria. The\nseverity of malaria depends largely upon the capacity of Plas-\nmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (RBCs) to adhere to\nthe endothelia of microvessels (cytoadherence) and to form\nrosettes with uninfected RBCs (14). This results in a high\nparasite burden and severe proin\ufb02ammatory responses in lo-\ncalized areas, leading to endothelial damage and organ dys-\nfunction (7). Further, upregulation of endothelial cell adhesion\nmolecules in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha poten-\ntially augments the cytoadherence (22). However, in recent\nstudies, increased NO production has been shown to be ben-\ne\ufb01cial because of its antiparasitic and antidisease effect, al-\nthough this is controversial, (1). This effect is due to inhibition\nof the cytoadherence process through downregulation of the\nexpression of ICAM1, VCAM1, and E-selectin, which are in-\nvolved in cytoadherence and microvascular sequestration of\nparasitized RBCs (18) and decreased production of tumor\nnecrosis factor by macrophages (9). NO is produced during the\nenzymatic conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by three iso-\nforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), namely inducible NOS,\nendothelial NOS (eNOS), and neuronal NOS (19). The eNOS-\nderived NO mediates vasodilation, inhibits platelet aggrega-\ntion and endothelial cell activation, and modulates expression\nof cell adhesion molecules (12). Further, endothelial dysfunc-\ntion in malaria is nearly universal when the disease is severe, is\nreversible with L-arginine, and likely contributes to pathogen-\nesis (27). Therefore, we hypothesized that functionally impor-\ntant variants of eNOS could in\ufb02uence individual susceptibility\nto malaria by altering the amount of NO generated by the\nendothelium.\nThe eNOS is constitutively expressed by vascular endothe-\nlium, and its gene is assigned to chromosome 7. This gene\ncontains 26 exons spaming \u000221 kb of genomic DNA and\nencodes an mRNA with 4,052 nucleotides, and a single copy is\npresent in the haploid genome (13). Several allelic variants of\nthe eNOS gene have been identi\ufb01ed, and a variant with a T/C\nsubstitution in the 5\u0003 \ufb02anking region near the promoter at\nposition \u0004786, a variant with a 27-bp variable number of tan-\ndem repeat (VNTR) region in intron 4, and a variant with a\nG/T substitution at position 894 in exon 7 that codes for re-\nplacement of glutamic acid by aspartic acid at residue 298 in\nthe mature eNOS protein, which together span \u00026.2 kb in the\nhuman genome, have been determined to be clinically impor-\ntant for several diseases. However, the mechanisms by which\nthese genetic variants can affect eNOS enzyme activity have\nnot been demonstrated. Impaired NO production as a result of\nthe polymorphism in exon 7 (8) and lower serum nitrite-nitrate\n(NOx) levels due to the \u0004786C variant have been observed (4,\n15). The VNTR polymorphism in intron 4 of eNOS (eNOS4b/a\npolymorphism) has been reported to be signi\ufb01cantly associated\nwith the plasma NOx concentration (25) and affects the tran-\nscription ef\ufb01ciency in a haplotype-speci\ufb01c fashion in linkage\ndisequilibrium with the T-786C polymorphism in the promoter\nregion (23). To the best of our knowledge, no other coding or\nfunctional variants in this region which impair endothelial NO\nproduction have been reported so far.

Malaria is considered to be hyper-\nendemic in this state, and transmission occurs throughout the year, with a\nseasonal peak from July to October. All four species of human malaria organisms\nare found in Orissa, but \u000585% of all clinical malaria is due to P. falciparum (16.).\nPatients who were clinically suspected to have malaria were screened for P.\nfalciparum infection using both thick and thin \ufb01lm methods. The severity of\nmalaria was classi\ufb01ed using the de\ufb01nitions and associated characteristics de-\nscribed by the World Health Organization (26). The following criteria were used\nto identify uncomplicated malaria cases: an axillary temperature of \u000537.5\u00b0C or\nsymptoms of headache, fever, and myalgia, no schizontemia, no intake of anti-\nmalarial drugs in the preceding week, and no history of hospitalization (to\nexclude individuals who had already had a severe malarial attack). The criteria\nused for cerebral malaria cases were an unarousable coma for \u00056 h after severe\nconvulsions and no indication of other causes of cerebral involvement and an\naxillary temperature of \u000537.5\u00b0C. The criteria used for exclusion were (i) a\ncon\ufb01rmed diagnosis of coinfection with other Plasmodium species; (ii) symptoms\nof mild or severe malaria with other acute infections, including intestinal geo-\nhelminthic infections; (iii) chronic diseases like tuberculosis, leprosy, and mal-\nnutrition; (iv) genetic disorders like hemoglobinopathies and glucose-6-phos-\nphate dehydrogenase de\ufb01ciency; and (v) pregnancy, smokers, patients with\ncoronary artery diseases, and diabetes mellitus. Venous blood was collected in\nEDTA-containing vials after informed consent was obtained from all enrolled\npatients (patients with mild malaria as well as patients with severe malaria) and\nimmediately centrifuged at 1,000 \u0006 g for 3 min. Plasma aliquots were then\nremoved and stored at \u000470\u00b0C. Each patient was treated according to local\nguidelines, and care was provided until the patient was discharged from the\nhospital. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Regional\nMedical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar, India.\nDNA isolation and genotyping. Human genomic DNA was puri\ufb01ed from 200\n\u0007l of blood using the standard protocol (17). In brief, blood cells were lysed with\nlysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCI [pH 8.0], 0.1 M EDTA [pH 8.0], 0.5% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate, 20 \u0007g/ml pancreatic RNase) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, and then proteinase\nK (100 \u0007g/ml) was added and the lysate was incubated at 54\u00b0C for 3 h. DNA was\nobtained by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and then\nresuspended in 50 \u0007l of DNase-free water. The T3C transition at position \u0004786\nin the 5\u0003 \ufb02anking region of the eNOS gene was investigated by performing\nPCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using forward primer\n5\u0003-ATGCTCCCACCAGGGCATCA-3\u0003 and reverse primer 5\u0003-GTCCTTGAGT\nCTGACATTAGGG-3\u0003. The PCR fragment (236 bp) was digested with the\nNgOAIV restriction enzyme overnight at 37\u00b0C. The wild-type sequence (\u0004786T)\nwas not cut, whereas the mutant sequence (\u0004786C) was cleaved into two frag-\nments (203 and 33 bp). Genotyping of the Glu2983Asp polymorphism was done\nby PCR amplifying exon 7 using sense primer 5\u0003-CATGAGGCTCAGCCCCA\nGAAC-3\u0003 and antisense primer 5\u0003-AGTCAATCCCTTTGGTGCTCAC-3\u0003, fol-\nlowed by digestion with the MboI restriction enzyme overnight at 37\u00b0C (6). In the\npresence of a T at position 894, which corresponds to Asp298, the 206-bp PCR\nproduct was cleaved into two fragments (119 and 87 bp). The restriction enzyme-\ndigested products were separated by electrophoresis on 3% Neusive agarose and\nvisualized by ethidium bromide (0.5 \u0007g/ml) staining. The intron 4 VNTR poly-\nmorphism of the eNOS gene was detected by the method of Wang et al. (24),\nwith a slight modi\ufb01cation (28). Brie\ufb02y, DNA samples were ampli\ufb01ed by PCR\nusing sense (5\u0003-AGGCCCTAGGTAGTGCCTTT-3\u0003) and antisense (5\u0003-TCTCT\nTAGTGCT GTGGTAC-3\u0003) primers that \ufb02anked the region containing the\n27-bp direct repeat of the intron 4 VNTR. The ampli\ufb01ed DNAs were separated\non 3% Neusive agarose and visualized by ethidium bromide (0.5 \u0007g/ml) staining.\nTo ensure that there was no error in genotyping, about 10% of the randomly\nselected samples were regenotyped for intron 4 VNTR and T-7863C substitu-\ntion, whereas genotyping for the Glu2983Asp substitution was repeated for all of\nthe samples and the results were found to be 100% concordant.\nPlasma NOx assay. Plasma samples from patients with acute renal failure and\npatients who were taking medications, such as long-acting nitrates (sorbitate),\nwere excluded from the study as these factors would have interfered with plasma\nNOx measurement. Plasma from patients who had consumed low-nitrate food\n12 h before blood was collected were included, and to eliminate the possibility of\nnitrate contamination of EDTA tubes, the tubes were prewashed with Aqua Max\n(Younglin, South Korea) water. In addition, the EDTA solution that we used\nhad undetectable levels of nitrite. Plasma NO3\n\u0004 plus NO2\n\u0004 (NOx) was measured\nby measuring NO2\n\u0004 after enzymatic conversion of NO3\n\u0004 to NO2\n\u0004 by nitrate\nreductase in duplicate according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using a com-\nmercial method (R&D Systems, Mimesota).\nStatistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad\nPrism (version 4.0). The association of genotypes and allele frequencies between\nthe two clinical groups was determined by computing the odds ratio derived from\na \b2 test. The \b2 test was also used to test the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\nStatistical signi\ufb01cance was de\ufb01ned as a P value of \t0.05. Linkage disequilibrium\nwas examined by \b2 analysis, and the extent of disequilibrium was determined as\nfollows: D\u0003 \n D/Dmax. The SNP Alyze program (version 7.0), which uses the\nexpectation maximization algorithm, was used to estimate the maximum likeli-\nhood of haplotype frequencies in each group, and to identify which speci\ufb01c\nhaplotypes were associated with a clinical outcome of malaria, a P value of\n\t0.00625 (0.05/number of haplotypes) was considered signi\ufb01cant to correct for\nthe number of comparisons made. The plasma NOx levels were compared by\nusing the Mam-Whitney U test.\nRESULTS\nA total of 244 patients (mean age, 36.2 years) with mild\nmalaria and 194 patients (mean age, 35.6 years) with severe\nmalaria were enrolled in this study. All referred patients were\nnatives of Orissa, had permanent resident status, and belonged\nto the Hindu population. In the severe malaria group, all the\npatients had cerebral malaria. Of these, 6.7% had hyperpara-\nsitemia (\u000525,000 parasites/\u0007l), 20.1% had scizontemia, 32%\nhad generalized convulsions, and 85% had jaundice (Table 1).\nExcept for the Glu2983Asp substitution, which showed signif-\nicant deviation in the mild malaria group of patients (\b2 \n 5.5,\nP \t 0.05), the genotypic distribution of all the polymorphic loci\nstudied here showed no deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg\nTABLE 1.

IMMUN.\n\nequilibrium. The Glu2983Asp polymorphism was observed\nmore frequently in the group of patients with mild malaria than\nin the group of patients with severe malaria. When the geno-\ntype and allele frequencies for the three polymorphic sites of\nthe eNOS gene (Glu2983Asp, intron 4 VNTR, and T-7863C)\nwere compared for the groups of patients with mild and severe\nmalaria,\na\nsigni\ufb01cant\ndifference\nwas\nobserved\nonly\nfor\nGlu2983Asp polymorphism (Table 2). Further, comparison of\nthe allele and haplotype frequencies revealed that the eNOS\nT-7863C polymorphism was strongly and signi\ufb01cantly (D\u0003 \n0.74, P \t 0.0001) linked to the intron 4 VNTR a/b polymor-\nphism, with the \u201c4a\u201d allele preferentially found in a subgroup\nof individuals with at least one \u201cC-786C\u201d allele. Interestingly,\nwhen the overall frequency distributions for all eight eNOS\nhaplotypes were compared for the groups with mild and severe\nmalaria, the H8 haplotype (C-b-Asp) was found to be more\ncommon in the group of patients with mild malaria than in the\ngroup of patients with severe malaria (P \n 0.0003, Bonferroni\ncorrection; 0.0003 multiplied by the number of haplotypes,\nPcorrected \n 0.0024) (Fig. 1). Further, the median plasma level\nof NOx was found to be higher in individuals with the\nGlu2983Asp substitution and was signi\ufb01cantly higher in the\nmild malaria group (P \u0001 0.0001), but the increase was not\nsigni\ufb01cant (Table 3) in the severe malaria group (P \n 0.0528).\nNo differences were observed in plasma NOx concentrations\naccording to gender or age.\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study was the \ufb01rst study to evaluate and com-\npare the distributions of eNOS genotypes and haplotypes in\npatients with mild malaria and patients with severe malaria. To\nexplore the hypothesis that susceptibility to cerebral malaria is\nin\ufb02uenced by genetic variation in eNOS, we genotyped three\ncommonly de\ufb01ned polymorphic loci of eNOS, Glu2983Asp,\nintron 4 VNTR, and T-7863C. We found an association for\nthe Glu2983Asp substitution (P \n 0.0037) and a single hap-\nlotype uniquely de\ufb01ned by \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d (Pcorrected \n 0.0024) for\nprotection against cerebral malaria, even though its frequency\nis about 3% in the population studied. Further, the increased\nmedian plasma NOx level in individuals with the Glu2983Asp\nsubstitution and its signi\ufb01cant association with the mild ma-\nlaria group (P \u0001 0.0001) but not with the severe malaria group\n(P \n 0.0528) suggest that the Glu2983Asp substitution and the\n\u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype may enhance eNOS expression and NO\nproduction, which leads to protection against cerebral malaria,\nalthough an association of the plasma NOx level with different\nhaplotypes could not be established due to the low frequency\nof some of the haplotypes as a small number of patients were\nselected for measurement of plasma NOx levels.\nThere have been few studies of the speci\ufb01c association be-\ntween the genetic polymorphisms of eNOS and plasma NOx\nconcentrations in different diseases. To date, there is no clear\nevidence for impaired NO production as a result of the G/T\npolymorphism in exon 7 that codes for replacement of glutamic\nacid by aspartic acid at residue 298 in the mature eNOS protein\n(8).The Glu2983Asp change has been suggested to increase\nthe susceptibility to cleavage of the eNOS enzyme (20) and\nhence result in low levels of NO production. Other workers\nargue that cleavage is due to in vitro acidic hydrolysis during\nsample preparation and does not appear to in\ufb02uence the sta-\nbility, half-life, or biologic activity of the enzyme (8). However,\na relationship between increased plasma NOx levels and poly-\nmorphisms in the eNOS gene has been observed for the\nGlu2983Asp mutation (28). Studies examining the functional-\nity of T-786C have focused on eNOS expression. Lower eNOS\nFIG. 1.

FALCIPARUM INFECTION\n2945\n\nmRNA and serum NOx levels have been found in individuals\nwith the \u0004786C variant (15). However, an investigation by\nHassan et al. (10) showed that in subjects with the C/C geno-\ntype, the levels of nitrates in the blood serum were higher than\nthe levels in subjects with the T/T genotype of the eNOS gene\npromoter. Given the intron location of the intron 4 repeating\nunit, it is less likely to be functional. Some reports indicate that\nindividuals with intron 4 VNTR polymorphism have lower\nplasma NO levels and exhibit decreased protein expression\n(21). However, this \ufb01nding is not supported by all studies, and\nin healthy Caucasians an association between homozygosity for\nthe 4a allele in the eNOS gene and increased plasma NOx\nlevels has been detected (25). However, many epidemiological\nstudies at the population and tissue levels support the possi-\nbility that T-786C and the 27-bp repeat in intron 4, which are\nin close linkage disequilibrium, may function in quantitative\neNOS regulation. A recent study by Wang et al. (23) shows\nthat the 27-bp repeat from eNOS intron 4 has a cis-regulating\neffect on the eNOS promoter and appears to be haplotype\ndependent. The highest transcription activity level was found\nfor the eNOS promoter in the presence of the \u201c\u0004786C\u201d (mu-\ntant) allele in the promoter and the \u201cb\u201d allele for intron 4,\nwhich are precisely the alleles included in the protective H8\nhaplotype in the present study. Furthermore, the increased\nmedian plasma NOx levels in individuals with the Glu2983Asp\nsubstitution and the signi\ufb01cant association of this substitution\nwith the mild malaria group (P \n 0.0001) but not with the\nsevere\nmalaria\ngroup\n(P\n\n0.0528)\nsuggest\nthat\nthe\nGlu2983Asp substitution and the \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype may be\nassociated with increased eNOS expression and NO produc-\ntion, leading to protection against cerebral malaria. The de-\ncrease in the overall frequency of the \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype in\nthis population may be due to linkage disequilibrium of the\n\u201cC-786C\u201d allele and the \u201ca\u201d allele of intron 4 VNTR. More-\nover, the deviation of the Glu2983Asp substitution from Har-\ndy-Weinberg equilibrium only in patients with mild malaria\nre\ufb02ects the possibility that this locus is under selection pres-\nsure. It is not known whether Asp298 allele polymorphism\nunderlies the functional characteristics of the \u201cC-b\u201d haplotype.\nTo determine whether the Glu2983Asp substitution in\ufb02uences\nthe plasma NOx level with the \u201cC-b\u201d haplotype, gene expres-\nsion analysis and protein production are necessary. The geno-\ntypic distribution of Asp298 and \u0004786C homozygous in our\npopulation (0.45% and 1.8%, respectively), which best \ufb01ts the\nAsian-type distribution (3), shows that studies with very large\nsample sizes are needed to obtain reliable estimates of the\neffect of these polymorphisms in our populations.\nIn\nconclusion,\nour\n\ufb01ndings\nsuggest\nthat\nthe\neNOS\nGlu2983Asp substitution and \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype have pro-\ntective effects against cerebral malaria and that the presence of\nAsp at position 298 may in\ufb02uence eNOS expression and NO\nproduction by the \u201cC-b\u201d haplotype. To evaluate the exact re-\nlationship between the eNOS polymorphisms and plasma NOx,\nit is necessary to explore and clarify the putative effects of the\nGlu2983Asp, T-786C, and intron 4 VNTR polymorphisms in-\ndividually and in combination on endothelial NO production\nand its function in terms of risk for malaria in different popu-\nlations where malaria is endemic.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the Indian Council of Medical Research, New\nDelhi, for \ufb01nancial support.

We found that there was an association of the Glu2983Asp\nsubstitution (P \u0001 0.0037; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% con\ufb01dence interval, 1.2 to 3.0) and a single unique haplotype\nde\ufb01ned by \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d (Pcorrected \u0001 0.0024) for protection against cerebral malaria. Further, the median plasma\nlevel of nitrite-nitrate was found to be increased in individuals with the Glu2983Asp substitution and was\nsigni\ufb01cantly higher in the mild malaria group (P < 0.0001), but the increase was not signi\ufb01cant in the severe\nmalaria group (P \u0001 0.0528). These \ufb01ndings suggest that the Glu2983Asp substitution and the \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d\nhaplotype may enhance eNOS expression and NO production, which leads to protection against cerebral\nmalaria. These \ufb01ndings may increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of malaria.\nMalaria parasites are major human pathogens that annually\nare associated with 300 million to 500 million clinical cases\nworldwide and 1 million to 3 million deaths (2). Despite high\ninfection rates, only 1% to 2% of malaria patients develop\nlife-threatening complications, such as cerebral malaria and\nprofound anemia, so natural selection has likely operated, to a\nlarge extent, on severity (11). This has prompted the search for\nfactors involved in natural resistance to severe malaria. The\nseverity of malaria depends largely upon the capacity of Plas-\nmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (RBCs) to adhere to\nthe endothelia of microvessels (cytoadherence) and to form\nrosettes with uninfected RBCs (14). This results in a high\nparasite burden and severe proin\ufb02ammatory responses in lo-\ncalized areas, leading to endothelial damage and organ dys-\nfunction (7). Further, upregulation of endothelial cell adhesion\nmolecules in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha poten-\ntially augments the cytoadherence (22). However, in recent\nstudies, increased NO production has been shown to be ben-\ne\ufb01cial because of its antiparasitic and antidisease effect, al-\nthough this is controversial, (1). This effect is due to inhibition\nof the cytoadherence process through downregulation of the\nexpression of ICAM1, VCAM1, and E-selectin, which are in-\nvolved in cytoadherence and microvascular sequestration of\nparasitized RBCs (18) and decreased production of tumor\nnecrosis factor by macrophages (9). NO is produced during the\nenzymatic conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by three iso-\nforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), namely inducible NOS,\nendothelial NOS (eNOS), and neuronal NOS (19). The eNOS-\nderived NO mediates vasodilation, inhibits platelet aggrega-\ntion and endothelial cell activation, and modulates expression\nof cell adhesion molecules (12). Further, endothelial dysfunc-\ntion in malaria is nearly universal when the disease is severe, is\nreversible with L-arginine, and likely contributes to pathogen-\nesis (27). Therefore, we hypothesized that functionally impor-\ntant variants of eNOS could in\ufb02uence individual susceptibility\nto malaria by altering the amount of NO generated by the\nendothelium.\nThe eNOS is constitutively expressed by vascular endothe-\nlium, and its gene is assigned to chromosome 7. This gene\ncontains 26 exons spanning \u000221 kb of genomic DNA and\nencodes an mRNA with 4,052 nucleotides, and a single copy is\npresent in the haploid genome (13). Several allelic variants of\nthe eNOS gene have been identi\ufb01ed, and a variant with a T/C\nsubstitution in the 5\u0003 \ufb02anking region near the promoter at\nposition \u0004786, a variant with a 27-bp variable number of tan-\ndem repeat (VNTR) region in intron 4, and a variant with a\nG/T substitution at position 894 in exon 7 that codes for re-\nplacement of glutamic acid by aspartic acid at residue 298 in\nthe mature eNOS protein, which together span \u00026.2 kb in the\nhuman genome, have been determined to be clinically impor-\ntant for several diseases. However, the mechanisms by which\nthese genetic variants can affect eNOS enzyme activity have\nnot been demonstrated. Impaired NO production as a result of\nthe polymorphism in exon 7 (8) and lower serum nitrite-nitrate\n(NOx) levels due to the \u0004786C variant have been observed (4,\n15). The VNTR polymorphism in intron 4 of eNOS (eNOS4b/a\npolymorphism) has been reported to be signi\ufb01cantly associated\nwith the plasma NOx concentration (25) and affects the tran-\nscription ef\ufb01ciency in a haplotype-speci\ufb01c fashion in linkage\ndisequilibrium with the T-786C polymorphism in the promoter\nregion (23). To the best of our knowledge, no other coding or\nfunctional variants in this region which impair endothelial NO\nproduction have been reported so far. Moreover, because of\ndifferent gene pools, lifestyles, and gene-environment interac-\n* Corresponding author.

Malaria is considered to be hyper-\nendemic in this state, and transmission occurs throughout the year, with a\nseasonal peak from July to October. All four species of human malaria organisms\nare found in Orissa, but \u000585% of all clinical malaria is due to P. falciparum (16.).\nPatients who were clinically suspected to have malaria were screened for P.\nfalciparum infection using both thick and thin \ufb01lm methods. The severity of\nmalaria was classi\ufb01ed using the de\ufb01nitions and associated characteristics de-\nscribed by the World Health Organization (26). The following criteria were used\nto identify uncomplicated malaria cases: an axillary temperature of \u000537.5\u00b0C or\nsymptoms of headache, fever, and myalgia, no schizontemia, no intake of anti-\nmalarial drugs in the preceding week, and no history of hospitalization (to\nexclude individuals who had already had a severe malarial attack). The criteria\nused for cerebral malaria cases were an unarousable coma for \u00056 h after severe\nconvulsions and no indication of other causes of cerebral involvement and an\naxillary temperature of \u000537.5\u00b0C. The criteria used for exclusion were (i) a\ncon\ufb01rmed diagnosis of coinfection with other Plasmodium species; (ii) symptoms\nof mild or severe malaria with other acute infections, including intestinal geo-\nhelminthic infections; (iii) chronic diseases like tuberculosis, leprosy, and mal-\nnutrition; (iv) genetic disorders like hemoglobinopathies and glucose-6-phos-\nphate dehydrogenase de\ufb01ciency; and (v) pregnancy, smokers, patients with\ncoronary artery diseases, and diabetes mellitus. Venous blood was collected in\nEDTA-containing vials after informed consent was obtained from all enrolled\npatients (patients with mild malaria as well as patients with severe malaria) and\nimmediately centrifuged at 1,000 \u0006 g for 3 min. Plasma aliquots were then\nremoved and stored at \u000470\u00b0C. Each patient was treated according to local\nguidelines, and care was provided until the patient was discharged from the\nhospital. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Regional\nMedical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar, India.\nDNA isolation and genotyping. Human genomic DNA was puri\ufb01ed from 200\n\u0007l of blood using the standard protocol (17). In brief, blood cells were lysed with\nlysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCI [pH 8.0], 0.1 M EDTA [pH 8.0], 0.5% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate, 20 \u0007g/ml pancreatic RNase) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, and then proteinase\nK (100 \u0007g/ml) was added and the lysate was incubated at 54\u00b0C for 3 h. DNA was\nobtained by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and then\nresuspended in 50 \u0007l of DNase-free water. The T3C transition at position \u0004786\nin the 5\u0003 \ufb02anking region of the eNOS gene was investigated by performing\nPCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using forward primer\n5\u0003-ATGCTCCCACCAGGGCATCA-3\u0003 and reverse primer 5\u0003-GTCCTTGAGT\nCTGACATTAGGG-3\u0003. The PCR fragment (236 bp) was digested with the\nNgOAIV restriction enzyme overnight at 37\u00b0C. The wild-type sequence (\u0004786T)\nwas not cut, whereas the mutant sequence (\u0004786C) was cleaved into two frag-\nments (203 and 33 bp). Genotyping of the Glu2983Asp polymorphism was done\nby PCR amplifying exon 7 using sense primer 5\u0003-CATGAGGCTCAGCCCCA\nGAAC-3\u0003 and antisense primer 5\u0003-AGTCAATCCCTTTGGTGCTCAC-3\u0003, fol-\nlowed by digestion with the MboI restriction enzyme overnight at 37\u00b0C (6). In the\npresence of a T at position 894, which corresponds to Asp298, the 206-bp PCR\nproduct was cleaved into two fragments (119 and 87 bp). The restriction enzyme-\ndigested products were separated by electrophoresis on 3% Neusive agarose and\nvisualized by ethidium bromide (0.5 \u0007g/ml) staining. The intron 4 VNTR poly-\nmorphism of the eNOS gene was detected by the method of Wang et al. (24),\nwith a slight modi\ufb01cation (28). Brie\ufb02y, DNA samples were ampli\ufb01ed by PCR\nusing sense (5\u0003-AGGCCCTAGGTAGTGCCTTT-3\u0003) and antisense (5\u0003-TCTCT\nTAGTGCT GTGGTAC-3\u0003) primers that \ufb02anked the region containing the\n27-bp direct repeat of the intron 4 VNTR. The ampli\ufb01ed DNAs were separated\non 3% Neusive agarose and visualized by ethidium bromide (0.5 \u0007g/ml) staining.\nTo ensure that there was no error in genotyping, about 10% of the randomly\nselected samples were regenotyped for intron 4 VNTR and T-7863C substitu-\ntion, whereas genotyping for the Glu2983Asp substitution was repeated for all of\nthe samples and the results were found to be 100% concordant.\nPlasma NOx assay. Plasma samples from patients with acute renal failure and\npatients who were taking medications, such as long-acting nitrates (sorbitate),\nwere excluded from the study as these factors would have interfered with plasma\nNOx measurement. Plasma from patients who had consumed low-nitrate food\n12 h before blood was collected were included, and to eliminate the possibility of\nnitrate contamination of EDTA tubes, the tubes were prewashed with Aqua Max\n(Younglin, South Korea) water. In addition, the EDTA solution that we used\nhad undetectable levels of nitrite. Plasma NO3\n\u0004 plus NO2\n\u0004 (NOx) was measured\nby measuring NO2\n\u0004 after enzymatic conversion of NO3\n\u0004 to NO2\n\u0004 by nitrate\nreductase in duplicate according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using a com-\nmercial method (R&D Systems, Minnesota).\nStatistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad\nPrism (version 4.0). The association of genotypes and allele frequencies between\nthe two clinical groups was determined by computing the odds ratio derived from\na \b2 test. The \b2 test was also used to test the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\nStatistical signi\ufb01cance was de\ufb01ned as a P value of \t0.05. Linkage disequilibrium\nwas examined by \b2 analysis, and the extent of disequilibrium was determined as\nfollows: D\u0003 \n D/Dmax. The SNP Alyze program (version 7.0), which uses the\nexpectation maximization algorithm, was used to estimate the maximum likeli-\nhood of haplotype frequencies in each group, and to identify which speci\ufb01c\nhaplotypes were associated with a clinical outcome of malaria, a P value of\n\t0.00625 (0.05/number of haplotypes) was considered signi\ufb01cant to correct for\nthe number of comparisons made. The plasma NOx levels were compared by\nusing the Mann-Whitney U test.\nRESULTS\nA total of 244 patients (mean age, 36.2 years) with mild\nmalaria and 194 patients (mean age, 35.6 years) with severe\nmalaria were enrolled in this study. All referred patients were\nnatives of Orissa, had permanent resident status, and belonged\nto the Hindu population. In the severe malaria group, all the\npatients had cerebral malaria. Of these, 6.7% had hyperpara-\nsitemia (\u000525,000 parasites/\u0007l), 20.1% had scizontemia, 32%\nhad generalized convulsions, and 85% had jaundice (Table 1).\nExcept for the Glu2983Asp substitution, which showed signif-\nicant deviation in the mild malaria group of patients (\b2 \n 5.5,\nP \t 0.05), the genotypic distribution of all the polymorphic loci\nstudied here showed no deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg\nTABLE 1.

IMMUN.\n\nequilibrium. The Glu2983Asp polymorphism was observed\nmore frequently in the group of patients with mild malaria than\nin the group of patients with severe malaria. When the geno-\ntype and allele frequencies for the three polymorphic sites of\nthe eNOS gene (Glu2983Asp, intron 4 VNTR, and T-7863C)\nwere compared for the groups of patients with mild and severe\nmalaria,\na\nsigni\ufb01cant\ndifference\nwas\nobserved\nonly\nfor\nGlu2983Asp polymorphism (Table 2). Further, comparison of\nthe allele and haplotype frequencies revealed that the eNOS\nT-7863C polymorphism was strongly and signi\ufb01cantly (D\u0003 \n0.74, P \t 0.0001) linked to the intron 4 VNTR a/b polymor-\nphism, with the \u201c4a\u201d allele preferentially found in a subgroup\nof individuals with at least one \u201cC-786C\u201d allele. Interestingly,\nwhen the overall frequency distributions for all eight eNOS\nhaplotypes were compared for the groups with mild and severe\nmalaria, the H8 haplotype (C-b-Asp) was found to be more\ncommon in the group of patients with mild malaria than in the\ngroup of patients with severe malaria (P \n 0.0003, Bonferroni\ncorrection; 0.0003 multiplied by the number of haplotypes,\nPcorrected \n 0.0024) (Fig. 1). Further, the median plasma level\nof NOx was found to be higher in individuals with the\nGlu2983Asp substitution and was signi\ufb01cantly higher in the\nmild malaria group (P \u0001 0.0001), but the increase was not\nsigni\ufb01cant (Table 3) in the severe malaria group (P \n 0.0528).\nNo differences were observed in plasma NOx concentrations\naccording to gender or age.\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study was the \ufb01rst study to evaluate and com-\npare the distributions of eNOS genotypes and haplotypes in\npatients with mild malaria and patients with severe malaria. To\nexplore the hypothesis that susceptibility to cerebral malaria is\nin\ufb02uenced by genetic variation in eNOS, we genotyped three\ncommonly de\ufb01ned polymorphic loci of eNOS, Glu2983Asp,\nintron 4 VNTR, and T-7863C. We found an association for\nthe Glu2983Asp substitution (P \n 0.0037) and a single hap-\nlotype uniquely de\ufb01ned by \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d (Pcorrected \n 0.0024) for\nprotection against cerebral malaria, even though its frequency\nis about 3% in the population studied. Further, the increased\nmedian plasma NOx level in individuals with the Glu2983Asp\nsubstitution and its signi\ufb01cant association with the mild ma-\nlaria group (P \u0001 0.0001) but not with the severe malaria group\n(P \n 0.0528) suggest that the Glu2983Asp substitution and the\n\u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype may enhance eNOS expression and NO\nproduction, which leads to protection against cerebral malaria,\nalthough an association of the plasma NOx level with different\nhaplotypes could not be established due to the low frequency\nof some of the haplotypes as a small number of patients were\nselected for measurement of plasma NOx levels.\nThere have been few studies of the speci\ufb01c association be-\ntween the genetic polymorphisms of eNOS and plasma NOx\nconcentrations in different diseases. To date, there is no clear\nevidence for impaired NO production as a result of the G/T\npolymorphism in exon 7 that codes for replacement of glutamic\nacid by aspartic acid at residue 298 in the mature eNOS protein\n(8).The Glu2983Asp change has been suggested to increase\nthe susceptibility to cleavage of the eNOS enzyme (20) and\nhence result in low levels of NO production. Other workers\nargue that cleavage is due to in vitro acidic hydrolysis during\nsample preparation and does not appear to in\ufb02uence the sta-\nbility, half-life, or biologic activity of the enzyme (8). However,\na relationship between increased plasma NOx levels and poly-\nmorphisms in the eNOS gene has been observed for the\nGlu2983Asp mutation (28). Studies examining the functional-\nity of T-786C have focused on eNOS expression. Lower eNOS\nFIG. 1.

FALCIPARUM INFECTION\n2945\n\nmRNA and serum NOx levels have been found in individuals\nwith the \u0004786C variant (15). However, an investigation by\nHassan et al. (10) showed that in subjects with the C/C geno-\ntype, the levels of nitrates in the blood serum were higher than\nthe levels in subjects with the T/T genotype of the eNOS gene\npromoter. Given the intron location of the intron 4 repeating\nunit, it is less likely to be functional. Some reports indicate that\nindividuals with intron 4 VNTR polymorphism have lower\nplasma NO levels and exhibit decreased protein expression\n(21). However, this \ufb01nding is not supported by all studies, and\nin healthy Caucasians an association between homozygosity for\nthe 4a allele in the eNOS gene and increased plasma NOx\nlevels has been detected (25). However, many epidemiological\nstudies at the population and tissue levels support the possi-\nbility that T-786C and the 27-bp repeat in intron 4, which are\nin close linkage disequilibrium, may function in quantitative\neNOS regulation. A recent study by Wang et al. (23) shows\nthat the 27-bp repeat from eNOS intron 4 has a cis-regulating\neffect on the eNOS promoter and appears to be haplotype\ndependent. The highest transcription activity level was found\nfor the eNOS promoter in the presence of the \u201c\u0004786C\u201d (mu-\ntant) allele in the promoter and the \u201cb\u201d allele for intron 4,\nwhich are precisely the alleles included in the protective H8\nhaplotype in the present study. Furthermore, the increased\nmedian plasma NOx levels in individuals with the Glu2983Asp\nsubstitution and the signi\ufb01cant association of this substitution\nwith the mild malaria group (P \n 0.0001) but not with the\nsevere\nmalaria\ngroup\n(P\n\n0.0528)\nsuggest\nthat\nthe\nGlu2983Asp substitution and the \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype may be\nassociated with increased eNOS expression and NO produc-\ntion, leading to protection against cerebral malaria. The de-\ncrease in the overall frequency of the \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype in\nthis population may be due to linkage disequilibrium of the\n\u201cC-786C\u201d allele and the \u201ca\u201d allele of intron 4 VNTR. More-\nover, the deviation of the Glu2983Asp substitution from Har-\ndy-Weinberg equilibrium only in patients with mild malaria\nre\ufb02ects the possibility that this locus is under selection pres-\nsure. It is not known whether Asp298 allele polymorphism\nunderlies the functional characteristics of the \u201cC-b\u201d haplotype.\nTo determine whether the Glu2983Asp substitution in\ufb02uences\nthe plasma NOx level with the \u201cC-b\u201d haplotype, gene expres-\nsion analysis and protein production are necessary. The geno-\ntypic distribution of Asp298 and \u0004786C homozygous in our\npopulation (0.45% and 1.8%, respectively), which best \ufb01ts the\nAsian-type distribution (3), shows that studies with very large\nsample sizes are needed to obtain reliable estimates of the\neffect of these polymorphisms in our populations.\nIn\nconclusion,\nour\n\ufb01ndings\nsuggest\nthat\nthe\neNOS\nGlu2983Asp substitution and \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype have pro-\ntective effects against cerebral malaria and that the presence of\nAsp at position 298 may in\ufb02uence eNOS expression and NO\nproduction by the \u201cC-b\u201d haplotype. To evaluate the exact re-\nlationship between the eNOS polymorphisms and plasma NOx,\nit is necessary to explore and clarify the putative effects of the\nGlu2983Asp, T-786C, and intron 4 VNTR polymorphisms in-\ndividually and in combination on endothelial NO production\nand its function in terms of risk for malaria in different popu-\nlations where malaria is endemic.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the Indian Council of Medical Research, New\nDelhi, for \ufb01nancial support.

Kar,1 and Manoranjan Ranjit1*\nRegional Medical Research Centre (ICMR), Bhubaneswar 751023, Orissa, 1ndia,1 and SCB Medical College & Hospital,\nCuttack 753007, Orissa, 1ndia2\nReceived 22 January 2009/Returned for modi\ufb01cation 2 March 2009/Accepted 1 April 2009\nTo explore the hypothesis that susceptibility to cerebral malaria is in\ufb02uenced by genetic variation in\nendothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), we genotyped three commonly de\ufb01ned polymorphic loci of eNOS,\nGlu2983Asp, intron 4 variable number of tandem repeat region, and T-7863C, in 244 patients (mean age, 36.2\nyears) with mild malaria and 194 patients (mean age, 35.6 years) with severe malaria belonging to same ethnic\ngroup in Orissa, an eastern 1ndian state. We found that there was an association of the Glu2983Asp\nsubstitution (P \u0001 0.0037; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% con\ufb01dence interval, 1.2 to 3.0) and a single unique haplotype\nde\ufb01ned by \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d (Pcorrected \u0001 0.0024) for protection against cerebral malaria. Further, the median plasma\nlevel of nitrite-nitrate was found to be increased in individuals with the Glu2983Asp substitution and was\nsigni\ufb01cantly higher in the mild malaria group (P < 0.0001), but the increase was not signi\ufb01cant in the severe\nmalaria group (P \u0001 0.0528). These \ufb01ndings suggest that the Glu2983Asp substitution and the \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d\nhaplotype may enhance eNOS expression and NO production, which leads to protection against cerebral\nmalaria. These \ufb01ndings may increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of malaria.\nMalaria parasites are major human pathogens that amually\nare associated with 300 million to 500 million clinical cases\nworldwide and 1 million to 3 million deaths (2). Despite high\ninfection rates, only 1% to 2% of malaria patients develop\nlife-threatening complications, such as cerebral malaria and\nprofound anemia, so natural selection has likely operated, to a\nlarge extent, on severity (11). This has prompted the search for\nfactors involved in natural resistance to severe malaria. The\nseverity of malaria depends largely upon the capacity of Plas-\nmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (RBCs) to adhere to\nthe endothelia of microvessels (cytoadherence) and to form\nrosettes with uninfected RBCs (14). This results in a high\nparasite burden and severe proin\ufb02ammatory responses in lo-\ncalized areas, leading to endothelial damage and organ dys-\nfunction (7). Further, upregulation of endothelial cell adhesion\nmolecules in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha poten-\ntially augments the cytoadherence (22). However, in recent\nstudies, increased NO production has been shown to be ben-\ne\ufb01cial because of its antiparasitic and antidisease effect, al-\nthough this is controversial, (1). This effect is due to inhibition\nof the cytoadherence process through downregulation of the\nexpression of 1CAM1, VCAM1, and E-selectin, which are in-\nvolved in cytoadherence and microvascular sequestration of\nparasitized RBCs (18) and decreased production of tumor\nnecrosis factor by macrophages (9). NO is produced during the\nenzymatic conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by three iso-\nforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), namely inducible NOS,\nendothelial NOS (eNOS), and neuronal NOS (19). The eNOS-\nderived NO mediates vasodilation, inhibits platelet aggrega-\ntion and endothelial cell activation, and modulates expression\nof cell adhesion molecules (12). Further, endothelial dysfunc-\ntion in malaria is nearly universal when the disease is severe, is\nreversible with L-arginine, and likely contributes to pathogen-\nesis (27). Therefore, we hypothesized that functionally impor-\ntant variants of eNOS could in\ufb02uence individual susceptibility\nto malaria by altering the amount of NO generated by the\nendothelium.\nThe eNOS is constitutively expressed by vascular endothe-\nlium, and its gene is assigned to chromosome 7. This gene\ncontains 26 exons spaming \u000221 kb of genomic DNA and\nencodes an mRNA with 4,052 nucleotides, and a single copy is\npresent in the haploid genome (13). Several allelic variants of\nthe eNOS gene have been identi\ufb01ed, and a variant with a T/C\nsubstitution in the 5\u0003 \ufb02anking region near the promoter at\nposition \u0004786, a variant with a 27-bp variable number of tan-\ndem repeat (VNTR) region in intron 4, and a variant with a\nG/T substitution at position 894 in exon 7 that codes for re-\nplacement of glutamic acid by aspartic acid at residue 298 in\nthe mature eNOS protein, which together span \u00026.2 kb in the\nhuman genome, have been determined to be clinically impor-\ntant for several diseases. However, the mechanisms by which\nthese genetic variants can affect eNOS enzyme activity have\nnot been demonstrated. 1mpaired NO production as a result of\nthe polymorphism in exon 7 (8) and lower serum nitrite-nitrate\n(NOx) levels due to the \u0004786C variant have been observed (4,\n15). The VNTR polymorphism in intron 4 of eNOS (eNOS4b/a\npolymorphism) has been reported to be signi\ufb01cantly associated\nwith the plasma NOx concentration (25) and affects the tran-\nscription ef\ufb01ciency in a haplotype-speci\ufb01c fashion in linkage\ndisequilibrium with the T-786C polymorphism in the promoter\nregion (23). To the best of our knowledge, no other coding or\nfunctional variants in this region which impair endothelial NO\nproduction have been reported so far.

Malaria is considered to be hyper-\nendemic in this state, and transmission occurs throughout the year, with a\nseasonal peak from July to October. All four species of human malaria organisms\nare found in Orissa, but \u000585% of all clinical malaria is due to P. falciparum (16.).\nPatients who were clinically suspected to have malaria were screened for P.\nfalciparum infection using both thick and thin \ufb01lm methods. The severity of\nmalaria was classi\ufb01ed using the de\ufb01nitions and associated characteristics de-\nscribed by the World Health Organization (26). The following criteria were used\nto identify uncomplicated malaria cases: an axillary temperature of \u000537.5\u00b0C or\nsymptoms of headache, fever, and myalgia, no schizontemia, no intake of anti-\nmalarial drugs in the preceding week, and no history of hospitalization (to\nexclude individuals who had already had a severe malarial attack). The criteria\nused for cerebral malaria cases were an unarousable coma for \u00056 h after severe\nconvulsions and no indication of other causes of cerebral involvement and an\naxillary temperature of \u000537.5\u00b0C. The criteria used for exclusion were (i) a\ncon\ufb01rmed diagnosis of coinfection with other Plasmodium species; (ii) symptoms\nof mild or severe malaria with other acute infections, including intestinal geo-\nhelminthic infections; (iii) chronic diseases like tuberculosis, leprosy, and mal-\nnutrition; (iv) genetic disorders like hemoglobinopathies and glucose-6-phos-\nphate dehydrogenase de\ufb01ciency; and (v) pregnancy, smokers, patients with\ncoronary artery diseases, and diabetes mellitus. Venous blood was collected in\nEDTA-containing vials after informed consent was obtained from all enrolled\npatients (patients with mild malaria as well as patients with severe malaria) and\nimmediately centrifuged at 1,000 \u0006 g for 3 min. Plasma aliquots were then\nremoved and stored at \u000470\u00b0C. Each patient was treated according to local\nguidelines, and care was provided until the patient was discharged from the\nhospital. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Regional\nMedical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar, 1ndia.\nDNA isolation and genotyping. Human genomic DNA was puri\ufb01ed from 200\n\u0007l of blood using the standard protocol (17). 1n brief, blood cells were lysed with\nlysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCI [pH 8.0], 0.1 M EDTA [pH 8.0], 0.5% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate, 20 \u0007g/ml pancreatic RNase) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, and then proteinase\nK (100 \u0007g/ml) was added and the lysate was incubated at 54\u00b0C for 3 h. DNA was\nobtained by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and then\nresuspended in 50 \u0007l of DNase-free water. The T3C transition at position \u0004786\nin the 5\u0003 \ufb02anking region of the eNOS gene was investigated by performing\nPCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using forward primer\n5\u0003-ATGCTCCCACCAGGGCATCA-3\u0003 and reverse primer 5\u0003-GTCCTTGAGT\nCTGACATTAGGG-3\u0003. The PCR fragment (236 bp) was digested with the\nNgOAIV restriction enzyme overnight at 37\u00b0C. The wild-type sequence (\u0004786T)\nwas not cut, whereas the mutant sequence (\u0004786C) was cleaved into two frag-\nments (203 and 33 bp). Genotyping of the Glu2983Asp polymorphism was done\nby PCR amplifying exon 7 using sense primer 5\u0003-CATGAGGCTCAGCCCCA\nGAAC-3\u0003 and antisense primer 5\u0003-AGTCAATCCCTTTGGTGCTCAC-3\u0003, fol-\nlowed by digestion with the MboI restriction enzyme overnight at 37\u00b0C (6). 1n the\npresence of a T at position 894, which corresponds to Asp298, the 206-bp PCR\nproduct was cleaved into two fragments (119 and 87 bp). The restriction enzyme-\ndigested products were separated by electrophoresis on 3% Neusive agarose and\nvisualized by ethidium bromide (0.5 \u0007g/ml) staining. The intron 4 VNTR poly-\nmorphism of the eNOS gene was detected by the method of Wang et al. (24),\nwith a slight modi\ufb01cation (28). Brie\ufb02y, DNA samples were ampli\ufb01ed by PCR\nusing sense (5\u0003-AGGCCCTAGGTAGTGCCTTT-3\u0003) and antisense (5\u0003-TCTCT\nTAGTGCT GTGGTAC-3\u0003) primers that \ufb02anked the region containing the\n27-bp direct repeat of the intron 4 VNTR. The ampli\ufb01ed DNAs were separated\non 3% Neusive agarose and visualized by ethidium bromide (0.5 \u0007g/ml) staining.\nTo ensure that there was no error in genotyping, about 10% of the randomly\nselected samples were regenotyped for intron 4 VNTR and T-7863C substitu-\ntion, whereas genotyping for the Glu2983Asp substitution was repeated for all of\nthe samples and the results were found to be 100% concordant.\nPlasma NOx assay. Plasma samples from patients with acute renal failure and\npatients who were taking medications, such as long-acting nitrates (sorbitate),\nwere excluded from the study as these factors would have interfered with plasma\nNOx measurement. Plasma from patients who had consumed low-nitrate food\n12 h before blood was collected were included, and to eliminate the possibility of\nnitrate contamination of EDTA tubes, the tubes were prewashed with Aqua Max\n(Younglin, South Korea) water. 1n addition, the EDTA solution that we used\nhad undetectable levels of nitrite. Plasma NO3\n\u0004 plus NO2\n\u0004 (NOx) was measured\nby measuring NO2\n\u0004 after enzymatic conversion of NO3\n\u0004 to NO2\n\u0004 by nitrate\nreductase in duplicate according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using a com-\nmercial method (R&D Systems, Mimesota).\nStatistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad\nPrism (version 4.0). The association of genotypes and allele frequencies between\nthe two clinical groups was determined by computing the odds ratio derived from\na \b2 test. The \b2 test was also used to test the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\nStatistical signi\ufb01cance was de\ufb01ned as a P value of \t0.05. Linkage disequilibrium\nwas examined by \b2 analysis, and the extent of disequilibrium was determined as\nfollows: D\u0003 \n D/Dmax. The SNP Alyze program (version 7.0), which uses the\nexpectation maximization algorithm, was used to estimate the maximum likeli-\nhood of haplotype frequencies in each group, and to identify which speci\ufb01c\nhaplotypes were associated with a clinical outcome of malaria, a P value of\n\t0.00625 (0.05/number of haplotypes) was considered signi\ufb01cant to correct for\nthe number of comparisons made. The plasma NOx levels were compared by\nusing the Mam-Whitney U test.\nRESULTS\nA total of 244 patients (mean age, 36.2 years) with mild\nmalaria and 194 patients (mean age, 35.6 years) with severe\nmalaria were enrolled in this study. All referred patients were\nnatives of Orissa, had permanent resident status, and belonged\nto the Hindu population. 1n the severe malaria group, all the\npatients had cerebral malaria. Of these, 6.7% had hyperpara-\nsitemia (\u000525,000 parasites/\u0007l), 20.1% had scizontemia, 32%\nhad generalized convulsions, and 85% had jaundice (Table 1).\nExcept for the Glu2983Asp substitution, which showed signif-\nicant deviation in the mild malaria group of patients (\b2 \n 5.5,\nP \t 0.05), the genotypic distribution of all the polymorphic loci\nstudied here showed no deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg\nTABLE 1.

The Glu2983Asp polymorphism was observed\nmore frequently in the group of patients with mild malaria than\nin the group of patients with severe malaria. When the geno-\ntype and allele frequencies for the three polymorphic sites of\nthe eNOS gene (Glu2983Asp, intron 4 VNTR, and T-7863C)\nwere compared for the groups of patients with mild and severe\nmalaria,\na\nsigni\ufb01cant\ndifference\nwas\nobserved\nonly\nfor\nGlu2983Asp polymorphism (Table 2). Further, comparison of\nthe allele and haplotype frequencies revealed that the eNOS\nT-7863C polymorphism was strongly and signi\ufb01cantly (D\u0003 \n0.74, P \t 0.0001) linked to the intron 4 VNTR a/b polymor-\nphism, with the \u201c4a\u201d allele preferentially found in a subgroup\nof individuals with at least one \u201cC-786C\u201d allele. 1nterestingly,\nwhen the overall frequency distributions for all eight eNOS\nhaplotypes were compared for the groups with mild and severe\nmalaria, the H8 haplotype (C-b-Asp) was found to be more\ncommon in the group of patients with mild malaria than in the\ngroup of patients with severe malaria (P \n 0.0003, Bonferroni\ncorrection; 0.0003 multiplied by the number of haplotypes,\nPcorrected \n 0.0024) (Fig. 1). Further, the median plasma level\nof NOx was found to be higher in individuals with the\nGlu2983Asp substitution and was signi\ufb01cantly higher in the\nmild malaria group (P \u0001 0.0001), but the increase was not\nsigni\ufb01cant (Table 3) in the severe malaria group (P \n 0.0528).\nNo differences were observed in plasma NOx concentrations\naccording to gender or age.\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study was the \ufb01rst study to evaluate and com-\npare the distributions of eNOS genotypes and haplotypes in\npatients with mild malaria and patients with severe malaria. To\nexplore the hypothesis that susceptibility to cerebral malaria is\nin\ufb02uenced by genetic variation in eNOS, we genotyped three\ncommonly de\ufb01ned polymorphic loci of eNOS, Glu2983Asp,\nintron 4 VNTR, and T-7863C. We found an association for\nthe Glu2983Asp substitution (P \n 0.0037) and a single hap-\nlotype uniquely de\ufb01ned by \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d (Pcorrected \n 0.0024) for\nprotection against cerebral malaria, even though its frequency\nis about 3% in the population studied. Further, the increased\nmedian plasma NOx level in individuals with the Glu2983Asp\nsubstitution and its signi\ufb01cant association with the mild ma-\nlaria group (P \u0001 0.0001) but not with the severe malaria group\n(P \n 0.0528) suggest that the Glu2983Asp substitution and the\n\u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype may enhance eNOS expression and NO\nproduction, which leads to protection against cerebral malaria,\nalthough an association of the plasma NOx level with different\nhaplotypes could not be established due to the low frequency\nof some of the haplotypes as a small number of patients were\nselected for measurement of plasma NOx levels.\nThere have been few studies of the speci\ufb01c association be-\ntween the genetic polymorphisms of eNOS and plasma NOx\nconcentrations in different diseases. To date, there is no clear\nevidence for impaired NO production as a result of the G/T\npolymorphism in exon 7 that codes for replacement of glutamic\nacid by aspartic acid at residue 298 in the mature eNOS protein\n(8).The Glu2983Asp change has been suggested to increase\nthe susceptibility to cleavage of the eNOS enzyme (20) and\nhence result in low levels of NO production. Other workers\nargue that cleavage is due to in vitro acidic hydrolysis during\nsample preparation and does not appear to in\ufb02uence the sta-\nbility, half-life, or biologic activity of the enzyme (8). However,\na relationship between increased plasma NOx levels and poly-\nmorphisms in the eNOS gene has been observed for the\nGlu2983Asp mutation (28). Studies examining the functional-\nity of T-786C have focused on eNOS expression. Lower eNOS\nFIG. 1.

FALCIPARUM 1NFECTION\n2945\n\nmRNA and serum NOx levels have been found in individuals\nwith the \u0004786C variant (15). However, an investigation by\nHassan et al. (10) showed that in subjects with the C/C geno-\ntype, the levels of nitrates in the blood serum were higher than\nthe levels in subjects with the T/T genotype of the eNOS gene\npromoter. Given the intron location of the intron 4 repeating\nunit, it is less likely to be functional. Some reports indicate that\nindividuals with intron 4 VNTR polymorphism have lower\nplasma NO levels and exhibit decreased protein expression\n(21). However, this \ufb01nding is not supported by all studies, and\nin healthy Caucasians an association between homozygosity for\nthe 4a allele in the eNOS gene and increased plasma NOx\nlevels has been detected (25). However, many epidemiological\nstudies at the population and tissue levels support the possi-\nbility that T-786C and the 27-bp repeat in intron 4, which are\nin close linkage disequilibrium, may function in quantitative\neNOS regulation. A recent study by Wang et al. (23) shows\nthat the 27-bp repeat from eNOS intron 4 has a cis-regulating\neffect on the eNOS promoter and appears to be haplotype\ndependent. The highest transcription activity level was found\nfor the eNOS promoter in the presence of the \u201c\u0004786C\u201d (mu-\ntant) allele in the promoter and the \u201cb\u201d allele for intron 4,\nwhich are precisely the alleles included in the protective H8\nhaplotype in the present study. Furthermore, the increased\nmedian plasma NOx levels in individuals with the Glu2983Asp\nsubstitution and the signi\ufb01cant association of this substitution\nwith the mild malaria group (P \n 0.0001) but not with the\nsevere\nmalaria\ngroup\n(P\n\n0.0528)\nsuggest\nthat\nthe\nGlu2983Asp substitution and the \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype may be\nassociated with increased eNOS expression and NO produc-\ntion, leading to protection against cerebral malaria. The de-\ncrease in the overall frequency of the \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype in\nthis population may be due to linkage disequilibrium of the\n\u201cC-786C\u201d allele and the \u201ca\u201d allele of intron 4 VNTR. More-\nover, the deviation of the Glu2983Asp substitution from Har-\ndy-Weinberg equilibrium only in patients with mild malaria\nre\ufb02ects the possibility that this locus is under selection pres-\nsure. 1t is not known whether Asp298 allele polymorphism\nunderlies the functional characteristics of the \u201cC-b\u201d haplotype.\nTo determine whether the Glu2983Asp substitution in\ufb02uences\nthe plasma NOx level with the \u201cC-b\u201d haplotype, gene expres-\nsion analysis and protein production are necessary. The geno-\ntypic distribution of Asp298 and \u0004786C homozygous in our\npopulation (0.45% and 1.8%, respectively), which best \ufb01ts the\nAsian-type distribution (3), shows that studies with very large\nsample sizes are needed to obtain reliable estimates of the\neffect of these polymorphisms in our populations. 1n\nconclusion,\nour\n\ufb01ndings\nsuggest\nthat\nthe\neNOS\nGlu2983Asp substitution and \u201cC-b-Asp\u201d haplotype have pro-\ntective effects against cerebral malaria and that the presence of\nAsp at position 298 may in\ufb02uence eNOS expression and NO\nproduction by the \u201cC-b\u201d haplotype. To evaluate the exact re-\nlationship between the eNOS polymorphisms and plasma NOx,\nit is necessary to explore and clarify the putative effects of the\nGlu2983Asp, T-786C, and intron 4 VNTR polymorphisms in-\ndividually and in combination on endothelial NO production\nand its function in terms of risk for malaria in different popu-\nlations where malaria is endemic.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the 1ndian Council of Medical Research, New\nDelhi, for \ufb01nancial support.

Glick\nDepartment of Biology, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L 3G1\nReceived 7 December 2001/Accepted 12 May 2002\nMany plant-associated bacteria synthesize the phytohormone indoleacetic acid (IAA). While 1AA produced\nby phytopathogenic bacteria, mainly by the indoleacetamide pathway, has been implicated in the induction of\nplant tumors, it is not clear whether 1AA synthesized by bene\ufb01cial bacteria, usually via the indolepyruvic acid\npathway, is involved in plant growth promotion. To determine whether bacterial 1AA enhances root develop-\nment in host plants, the ipdc gene that encodes indolepyruvate decarboxylase, a key enzyme in the indolepyruvic\nacid pathway, was isolated from the plant growth-promoting bacterium Pseudomonas putida GR12-2 and an 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant constructed by insertional mutagenesis. The canola seedling primary roots from seeds\ntreated with wild-type P. putida GR12-2 were on average 35 to 50% longer than the roots from seeds treated with\nthe 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant and the roots from uninoculated seeds. 1n addition, exposing mung bean cuttings to\nhigh levels of 1AA by soaking them in a suspension of the wild-type strain stimulated the formation of many,\nvery small, adventitious roots. Formation of fewer roots was stimulated by treatment with the 1AA-de\ufb01cient\nmutant. These results suggest that bacterial 1AA plays a major role in the development of the host plant root\nsystem.\nBacteria that inhabit the rhizosphere may in\ufb02uence plant\ngrowth by contributing to a host plant\u2019s endogenous pool of\nphytohormones, such as auxins. Production of the auxin in-\ndoleacetic acid (IAA) is widespread among plant-associated\nbacteria (36). 1n phytopathogenic bacteria, such as Agrobacte-\nrium tumefaciens and pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae, 1AA\nis produced from tryptophan via the intermediate indoleacet-\namide and has been implicated in the induction of plant tu-\nmors. Bene\ufb01cial bacteria synthesize 1AA predominantly by an\nalternate tryptophan-dependant pathway, through indolepyru-\nvic acid; however, the role of bacterial 1AA in plant growth\npromotion remains undetermined.\nPromotion of root growth is one of the major markers by\nwhich the bene\ufb01cial effect of plant growth-promoting bacteria\nis measured (15). Rapid establishment of roots, whether by\nelongation of primary roots or by proliferation of lateral and\nadventitious roots, is advantageous for young seedlings as it\nincreases their ability to anchor themselves to the soil and to\nobtain water and nutrients from their environment, thus en-\nhancing their chances for survival. Most root-promoting bac-\nteria synthesize 1AA, and their effect on plants mimics that of\nexogenous 1AA.\nPlants generally grow one or more primary roots from which\nlateral roots emerge by division of speci\ufb01c pericycle cells. Ad-\nventitious roots are a type of lateral root that arise from non-\nroot tissue, such as the tissue at the base of the stem or on\ncuttings. Whereas lateral and adventitious roots are induced by\nhigh concentrations of exogenous 1AA, a feature exploited in\nhorticulture by applying natural and synthetic auxins, primary\nroot growth is stimulated by application of relatively low levels\nof 1AA, typically between 10\u00029 and 10\u000212 M (2, 35, 39), and is\ninhibited by higher 1AA concentrations, likely via auxin-in-\nduced ethylene (37).\nTwo different approaches have been taken to test for a\nsimilar trend in the effect of bacterial 1AA on plant growth. 1n\none method the effects of inoculating roots with bacterial mu-\ntants that produce different levels of 1AA are compared. 1n the\nsecond approach the size of the inoculum of a single strain is\nvaried; the rationale for this approach is that a higher inoculum\ndensity means that more 1AA is available to the plant. While\ndemonstrating that bacterial mutants that overproduce 1AA\nhave a root growth-inhibiting effect has been relatively straight-\nforward (30, 42, 49), establishing a direct relationship between\nenhanced root growth and bacterial 1AA has proven to be\nmore elusive, given the dif\ufb01culty of isolating bacterial mutants\nthat are completely de\ufb01cient in 1AA synthesis (1, 8, 29, 31).\nThe rhizobacterium Pseudomonas putida GR12-2 is a strong\ncandidate for development as a soil inoculant to enhance crop\nyields. 1noculation of canola, tomato, and other agriculturally\nimportant plants with this strain results in substantial promo-\ntion of seedling root growth (7, 18). Characteristics that may\ncontribute to the ability of P. putida GR12-2 to enhance plant\ngrowth include the capacity to synthesize siderophores and\nthereby provide iron for the plant (7), the capacity to lower\ngrowth-inhibiting levels of ethylene in plant tissues by produc-\ntion of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deami-\nnase (16, 21), and the capacity to secrete 1AA (49).\nTo determine if 1AA is involved in the stimulation of root\ngrowth by P. putida GR12-2, the ipdc gene encoding indo-\nlepyruvate decarboxylase, which catalyzes a key step in the\nindolepyruvic acid pathway for 1AA synthesis, was isolated,\nand an 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant was constructed by insertional\nmutagenesis of ipdc. Changes in root development as a conse-\nquence of root interactions with this mutant were documented\nand compared to the effects of the wild-type bacterium.\n* Corresponding author.

(Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada) and\nwas routinely grown at 27\u00b0C in 3.6% tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Difco). The DF\nsalts minimal medium of Dworkin and Foster (12) was also used for propagation\nof P. putida GR12-2 as indicated below. Escherichia coli DH5\u0003 (19) was grown\nat 37\u00b0C in 2% Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Difco). 1solation of the ipdc gene by PCR. The following PCR primers were designed\nfrom the previously published Enterobacter cloacae FERM BP-1529 ipdc gene\nsequence (24) to span the entire open reading frame: forward primer 5\u0004 GAA\nGGATCCCTGTTATGCGAACC 3\u0004 and reverse primer 5\u0004 CTGGGGATCCG\nACAAGTAATCAGGC 3\u0004 (MOBIX, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario,\nCanada). A BamHI restriction site (underlined) was incorporated into the 5\u0004 end\nof both the forward and reverse primers in order to facilitate subsequent sub-\ncloning of PCR products. These primers were used to amplify the ipdc gene from\nboth lysed cells of P. putida GR12-2 and puri\ufb01ed P. putida GR12-2 genomic\nDNA. PCR products were sequenced (MOBIX, McMaster University), and the\nsequence was analyzed by using the algorithms BLAST (National Center for\nBiotechnology 1nformation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]) and ClustalW (EMBL\n[http://www.ebi.ac.uk]).\nMarker exchange mutagenesis. The ipdc sequence was subcloned into the\nsuicide vector pJQ200 (40) and then disrupted by insertion of a gene for kana-\nmycin resistance carried on a 2.3-kb EcoRI fragment from pHP45\u0005-Km (14) into\nthe unique PmlI site roughly in the middle of ipdc. The resultant plasmid,\npJQIPDC-Kan, was \ufb01rst introduced into E. coli S17.1 (45) competent cells and\nselected for by resistance to gentamicin (30 \u0006g/ml) and kanamycin (50 \u0006g/ml),\nand then it was transferred to P. putida GR12-2 by \ufb01lter mating. Transconjugants\nwere identi\ufb01ed by growth on Simmons citrate agar supplemented with kanamy-\ncin and then on DF salts minimal medium agar plus kanamycin for veri\ufb01cation.\nTo select for transconjugants in which the functional ipdc gene in the chromo-\nsome was replaced by the disrupted ipdc gene from the plasmid by double\ncrossover between homologous ipdc sequences, colonies resistant to the lethal\neffects of the vector-encoded sacB gene product in the presence of sucrose were\nidenti\ufb01ed on tryptic soy agar containing kanamycin and 5% (wt/vol) sucrose. 1n\naddition, these colonies were plated on tryptic soy agar supplemented with\ngentamicin; lack of growth con\ufb01rmed the absence of gentamicin acetyltrans-\nferase also encoded on the vector. 1nsertion of the kanamycin resistance gene\ninto the chromosomal ipdc gene was veri\ufb01ed by PCR and by Southern hybrid-\nization.\nQuanti\ufb01cation of 1AA production. Wild-type and 1AA-de\ufb01cient P. putida\nGR12-2 were propagated overnight in 5 ml of DF salts minimal media, and then\n20-\u0006l aliquots were transferred into 5 ml of DF salts minimal media supple-\nmented with the following concentrations of L-tryptophan (from a \ufb01lter-sterilized\n2-mg/ml stock prepared in warm water; Sigma): 0, 50, 100, 200, and 500 \u0006g/ml.\nAfter incubation for 42 h, the density of each culture was measured spectropho-\ntometrically at 600 nm, and then the bacterial cells were removed from the\nculture medium by centrifugation (5,500 \u0007 g, 10 min). A 1-ml aliquot of the\nsupernatant was mixed vigorously with 4 ml of Salkowski\u2019s reagent (150 ml of\nconcentrated H2SO4, 250 ml of distilled H2O, 7.5 ml of 0.5 M FeCl3\u00b76H2O [17])\nand allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min before the absorbance at\n535 nm was measured. The concentration of 1AA in each culture medium was\ndetermined by comparison with a standard curve.\nTo con\ufb01rm that the mutant strain does not produce 1AA when high concen-\ntrations of tryptophan are present, the 1AA levels in the supernatants from\nwild-type and mutant cultures grown in the DF salts minimal medium containing\n500 \u0006g of L-tryptophan per ml were measured by high-performance liquid chro-\nmatography (HPLC). Filtered supernatant was analyzed by using a Hewlett-\nPackard model 1100 HPLC equipped with an Ultrasphere reverse-phase C18\ncolumn (5 \u0006m; 4.6 by 150 mm); the mobile phase was acetonitrile\u201350 mM\nKH2PO4 (pH 3) (30/70) at a \ufb02ow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluates were detected at 220\nnm, and 1AA was quanti\ufb01ed by integrating the areas under the peaks; authentic 1AA (Sigma) was used as a standard. The 1AA produced by each strain was\nmeasured in triplicate.\nRoot elongation assay. Cultures of wild-type and 1AA-de\ufb01cient P. putida\nGR12-2 were grown overnight from single colonies in 5 ml of DF salts minimal\nmedia without and with kanamycin, respectively. After approximately 24 h, 20 \u0006l\nof each culture was transferred to 5 ml of DF salts minimal medium supple-\nmented with tryptophan (200 \u0006g/ml) to induce 1AA production and incubated\nfor an additional 42 h. The turbidities of the cultures were measured spectro-\nphotometrically at 600 nm before the bacterial cells were separated from the\nculture medium by centrifugation. Each supernatant was immediately assayed to\ndetermine the 1AA concentration by Salkowski\u2019s assay as described above. Cells\nwere washed twice in 5 ml of sterile 0.03 M MgSO4, and the \ufb01nal suspension\nwas adjusted to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5 with 0.03 M MgSO4.\nCanola seeds (Hyola 401), kindly provided by J. Omielan (University of\nGuelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada), were prepared and inoculated by the meth-\nod outlined by Lifshitz et al. (28), with some modi\ufb01cations (7). Approximately\n300 seeds, previously stored in a desiccator at 4\u00b0C, were surface sterilized by\nsoaking them in 10 ml of 70% ethanol for 1 min and then in 10 ml of 1% sodium\nhypochlorite (bleach) for 10 min. To remove the residual bleach, the seeds were\nwashed \ufb01ve times with sterile distilled water. For each treatment, approximately\n100 seeds were transferred aseptically to sterile polystyrene petri dishes and\nincubated with 5 ml of either the wild-type or mutant bacterial suspension at\nroom temperature for 1 h to allow the bacteria to bind to the seed coat and for\nseed imbibition. Seeds were also incubated in 5 ml of 0.03 M MgSO4 under the\nsame conditions as a control.\nSix seeds were aseptically placed in each growth pouch (Mega 1nterna-\ntional, Minneapolis, Minn.), which had been previously \ufb01lled with 10 ml of\ndistilled water and autoclaved. For each treatment, 10 pouches were pre-\npared. The pouches were placed upright in metal racks, with one treatment\nper rack to prevent cross-contamination, and there were two empty pouches\nat each end, of each rack. The racks were set in a plastic bin containing about\n3 cm of deionized water and covered loosely with plastic wrap to prevent\ndehydration. The pouches were incubated in a growth chamber at 20\u00b0C with\na daily cycle consisting of 12 h of darkness followed by 12 h of light (18 \u0006mol\nof photons/m2/s). For the \ufb01rst 2 days, the seeds were kept in the dark by\ncovering the pouches with aluminum foil. After 5 days, shoot and primary\nroot lengths were measured and analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (F\nvalues are indicated below). Seeds that had failed to germinate 3 days after\nthey were sown were marked, and shoots and roots that subsequently devel-\noped from these seeds were not measured.\nColonization assay. To determine if the 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida\nGR12-2 is impaired in the ability to colonize roots, canola seeds were inoculated\nwith either wild-type P. putida GR12-2 or the 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida\nGR12-2 or with a 1:1 mixture of the wild-type and mutant strains. Bacteria and\nseeds were prepared, inoculated, and incubated as described above for the root\nelongation assay. After 7 days, bacteria were extracted from six roots for each\ntreatment (two roots from each of three growth pouches) by brie\ufb02y rinsing the\nroots in sterile water and then suspending the roots in 1 ml of phosphate buffer\n(25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM Na2HPO4; pH 7.0) and shaking the preparations\nvigorously for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Dilutions were prepared in phosphate buffer and spread\nonto LB agar to determine total bacterial counts and onto LB agar containing\nkanamycin (50 \u0006g/ml) to determine mutant counts.\nRooting assay. The effects of wild-type P. putida GR12-2 and the 1AA-de\ufb01-\ncient mutant of P. putida GR12-2 on the development of adventitious roots\non mung bean cuttings were assessed by using the method outlined by Mayak\net al. (33). Mung bean (Vigna radiata) seeds were surface sterilized in a\nmanner similar to that used for canola seeds as described above. Seeds were\nimbibed for 1 h in sterile distilled water, sown in sterile vermiculite, and then\nincubated in a growth chamber as described above. After 7 days, the portions of\nthe seedlings above the surface of the vermiculite were excised with a razor blade\nand placed immediately in either water or a bacterial suspension prepared as\nfollows.\nFive milliliters of DF salts minimal medium was inoculated with the wild-\ntype or the 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida GR12-2 and incubated over-\nnight. Eighty microliters of each overnight culture was transferred to 20 ml of\nDF salts minimal medium containing tryptophan (200 \u0006g/ml) and incubated\nfor an additional 42 h. Cells were washed twice with sterile distilled water and\nresuspended in sterile water to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5.\nThree milliliters of each bacterial preparation was transferred to each of 10\nborosilicate glass tubes (10 by 75 mm), and 10 additional tubes were \ufb01lled\nwith 3 ml of sterile distilled water. One mung bean cutting was placed in each\ntube (a total of 10 cuttings per treatment), and the tubes were placed in a\nrack, covered loosely with plastic wrap to prevent evaporation, and incubated\nin the growth chamber under the conditions described above. After 8 days,\nthe cuttings were rinsed brie\ufb02y with distilled water, and the numbers and\nlengths of adventitious roots were measured by using a magnifying glass; the\ndata were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (F values are indicated\nbelow).\nNucleotide sequence accession number. The sequence of the P. putida GR12-2\nipdc gene reported in this paper has been deposited in the GenBank database\nunder accession number AF285632.\n3796\nPATTEN AND GLICK\nAPPL. ENVIRON. MICROBIOL.\n\nRESULTS 1solation of the ipdc gene. Hybridization of a P. putida\nGR12-2 genomic library (prepared by ligation of Sau3AI-di-\ngested fragments of total DNA with pUC19 and transforma-\ntion of E. coli DH5\u0003) with the indolepyruvate decarboxylase\n(ipdc) gene from E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 (24) revealed a\nsingle colony carrying 200 bp of the ipdc sequence. The se-\nquence was 98% identical at the nucleotide level to the 3\u0004 end\nof the E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 ipdc gene. The region down-\nstream of the ipdc gene contains a putative transcription ter-\nmination signal, identi\ufb01ed by the presence of sequences capa-\nble of forming a stable stem-loop structure in the mRNA and\na sequence 72% identical at the nucleotide level to an open\nreading frame in E. coli of unknown function (accession no.\nAE000327) on the opposite strand. Working on the assump-\ntion that the high degree of identity between the 3\u0004 ends of the\nP. putida GR12-2 and E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 ipdc se-\nquences could be extended to the entire gene, we designed\nPCR primers from the previously published E. cloacae FERM\nBP-1529 sequence to amplify the entire open reading frame.\nElectrophoresis of the PCR products obtained by using P.\nputida GR12-2 genomic DNA or cell lysates as templates re-\nvealed a single band of the expected size, about 1.7 kb. Se-\nquence analysis of the PCR products and alignment of the\nnucleotide sequence with the ipdc gene from E. cloacae FERM\nBP-1529 con\ufb01rmed that the P. putida GR12-2 ipdc gene had\nindeed been isolated. Furthermore, the translated amino acid\nsequence is similar to the amino acid sequences of other\nknown bacterial indolepyruvate decarboxylases (Fig. 1).\nThe P. putida GR12-2 indolepyruvate decarboxylase is also\nsimilar to pyruvate decarboxylases from Zymomonas mobilis\nand Saccharomyces cerevisiae, exhibiting substantial levels of\nidentity (33 and 36%, respectively) and similarity (51 and 53%,\nrespectively) in the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). Four of the\nsix residues believed to be involved in substrate binding and\ncatalysis of pyruvate decarboxylase are conserved in the in-\ndolepyruvate decarboxylase sequence; residues Asp29, His115,\nHis116, and Glu468 of indolepyruvate decarboxylase from P. pu-\ntida GR12-2 correspond to residues Asp27, His113, His114, and\nGlu473 in the active site of Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase\n(11) (Fig. 1). 1n addition, most of the residues known to bind\nthe cofactors Mg2\u0001 and thiamine diphosphate in pyruvate de-\ncarboxylase are conserved in indolepyruvate decarboxylase;\nthese residues include Glu52, Gly408, Asp435, Asn462, and\nGly464.\nConstruction of an 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant. Vector pJQ200\n(40) was used to deliver the ipdc sequence, disrupted by inser-\ntion of a gene for kanamycin resistance, into the genome of P.\nputida GR12-2. This plasmid has an origin of transfer (oriT)\nand mob genes from plasmid RP4, enabling transfer of the\nvector from E. coli S17.1 (45) into P. putida GR12-2 via con-\njugation. However, once in P. putida GR12-2, the vector can-\nnot replicate because it has an origin of replication derived\nfrom pACYC184 that is functional only in enterobacteria (40).\nThus, following transfer of the vector to P. putida GR12-2,\nkanamycin-resistant cells can arise only if the kanamycin resis-\ntance gene is inserted into the ipdc gene in the genome by\nhomologous recombination between the ipdc sequences on the\nplasmid and in the chromosome. 1n addition, because genta-\nmicin acetyltransferase and SacB are encoded on the vector,\nselection for the absence of these traits (that is, selection for\nsensitivity to gentamicin and resistance to the lethal effects of\nSacB in the presence of sucrose) selects against the incorpo-\nration of the entire plasmid into the genome that would result\nfrom a single crossover event.\nFollowing the transfer of pJQIPDC-Kan from E. coli S17.1\nto P. putida GR12-2 by conjugation, transconjugants were ini-\ntially selected on Simmons citrate agar (on which E. coli donor\ncells cannot grow) containing kanamycin (on which nontrans-\nformed P. putida GR12-2 cells cannot grow). Several colonies\nwere picked and subcultured on DF salts minimal agar (on\nwhich E. coli cannot grow) containing kanamycin to con\ufb01rm\nthat they were indeed derived from P. putida GR12-2. Growth\non TSB agar containing kanamycin and 5% sucrose and the\nlack of growth on TSB agar containing gentamicin indicated\nthat the kanamycin resistance gene, but not the remainder of\nthe plasmid, had been inserted into the chromosome in all\nselected transconjugants. Replacement of the functional ipdc\ngene in the chromosome of P. putida GR12-2 with the\nipdc gene disrupted by the kanamycin resistance gene from\npJQIPDC-Kan was con\ufb01rmed by PCR by using primers de-\nsigned to amplify the ipdc gene and whole-cell lysates of\ntransconjugants and wild-type P. putida GR12-2 as templates.\nThe PCR products from transconjugants were 2.3 kb larger,\ncorresponding to the size of the kanamycin resistance gene\nfragment, than the PCR products from the wild-type strain\n(data not shown); the PCR products were con\ufb01rmed to contain\nthe ipdc sequence by Southern hybridization (data not shown). 1n addition, Southern hybridization con\ufb01rmed the presence of\na larger EcoRI fragment carrying the ipdc gene in the chro-\nmosome of the mutant strain than in the chromosome of the\nwild-type bacterium (data not shown).\nQuanti\ufb01cation of 1AA production. 1n the absence of trypto-\nphan supplements, both the 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant and wild-\ntype P. putida GR12-2 produced very low levels of 1AA (Table\n1). However, when both strains were grown in the presence of\n50 \u0006g of tryptophan per ml for approximately 42 h, wild-type\nP. putida GR12-2 responded by producing higher levels of 1AA, while the mutant was not capable of producing signi\ufb01cant\namounts of 1AA (Table 1). As the concentration of tryptophan\nin the growth medium was increased, 1AA production by the\nwild-type strain increased. 1n contrast, 1AA production by the\nmutant strain remained very low. Measurement of 1AA by\nHPLC con\ufb01rmed that in the presence of a high concentration\nof tryptophan (500 \u0006g/ml), the wild-type bacterium produced\nhigh levels of 1AA (68.3 \b 2.2 \u0006g/ml/OD600 unit), while 1AA\nwas not detected in the medium from mutant cells (\t1 \u0006g/ml/\nOD600 unit). The apparent slight increase in 1AA concentra-\ntion in the medium in mutant cultures containing 500 \u0006g of\ntryptophan per ml, as measured colorimetrically by reaction\nwith Salkowski\u2019s reagent (Table 1), may have been due to\naccumulation of indolepyruvic acid, which can also react with\nSalkowski\u2019s reagent, albeit to a much lesser extent than 1AA\n(data not shown). 1ndolepyruvic acid is the product of catalysis\nof tryptophan by tryptophan transaminase, the \ufb01rst step in the 1AA biosynthetic pathway, and is the substrate for indolepyru-\nvate decarboxylase, which is not functional in the mutant.\nGrowth of the mutant and wild-type P. putida GR12-2 was not\nVOL. 68, 2002\nROLE OF P.

Whereas the roots from seeds treated with wild-type\nP. putida GR12-2 were on average 35% longer than the roots\nfrom uninoculated control seeds after 5 days (P \t 0.01; F1/8 \n30.1), the lengths of roots from seeds treated with the 1AA-\nde\ufb01cient mutant were not different from the lengths of roots\nfrom uninoculated control seeds (P \t 0.01; F1/8 \n 4.3) (Table\n2). 1AA produced by the wild-type strain had no effect on shoot\nlength, as the lengths of shoots from seeds inoculated with\nwild-type P. putida GR12-2 were not different from the lengths\nof shoots from uninoculated seeds (F1/4 \n 5.1) (Table 2). Thus,\nas expected, eliminating 1AA production did not affect shoot\nlength (F1/4 \n 3.9).\nThe loss of the capacity to synthesize 1AA did not reduce the\nability of 1AA-de\ufb01cient P. putida GR12-2 to colonize canola\nseedling roots. The population size attained by the mutant\nbacterium on the surface of roots 7 days after seed inoculation\nwas similar to that attained by the wild-type strain when it was\ninoculated alone (Table 3). 1n addition, the relative population\nsizes were maintained on the roots when the seeds were coin-\noculated with equal amounts of the two strains (Table 3).\nRooting assay. Mung bean cuttings that were excised above\nthe roots after 7 days of growth in vermiculite and placed in\neither water or a bacterial suspension had visible roots at the\nbase of the stem after 5 days. After 8 days, the cuttings in water\nhad a few long roots (on average, about seven 3.4-mm-long\nroots growing just above the base) (Table 4). More than three\ntimes as many adventitious roots developed on cuttings placed\nin a suspension of wild-type P. putida GR12-2. Most of these\nroots were very small (less than 1 mm long) and were distrib-\nuted over several centimeters up from the base of the stem;\nsometimes there were a few longer roots right at the base.\nRoots that developed in the suspension of the 1AA-de\ufb01cient\nmutant of P. putida GR12-2 were both abundant and long; this\nis likely the best situation for propagation of cuttings in the\nlong term. Twice as many roots were present on these cuttings\nas on the cuttings growing in water, and the roots were gener-\nally longer than those that developed in the wild-type bacterial\nsuspension (Table 4).\nDISCUSSION\nThe amino acid sequence determined from the ipdc gene\nisolated from P. putida GR12-2 reveals a 552-amino-acid pro-\ntein with a predicted molecular weight of approximately\n60,000. This protein is not transcribed from an operon con-\ntaining the other genes involved in the biosynthesis of 1AA by\nthe indolepyruvic acid pathway as it is transcribed from its own\npromoter (unpublished data) and has a transcription termina-\ntion sequence just downstream of the translation stop codon. 1t\nis reasonable to conclude that the enzymes involved in the\nindolepyruvic acid pathway are not expressed from an operon\nbecause multiple copies of the gene encoding the \ufb01rst enzyme\nin the pathway, an aromatic aminotransferase, are often pres-\nent in a single bacterium, and the enzyme prefers amino acid\nsubstrates other than tryptophan (22, 23, 46). Thus, this aro-\nmatic aminotransferase is not solely an 1AA biosynthesis en-\nzyme.\nThe sequence of indolepyruvate decarboxylase from P. pu-\ntida GR12-2 is similar to the sequence of indolepyruvate de-\ncarboxylase from E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 (99% identity),\nwhich was isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumber (24), and\nto the sequence of the same protein from Erwinia herbicola\n299R (57% identity and 71% similarity), an epiphytic bacte-\nrium isolated from pear (5). The sequences of the indolepyru-\nvate decarboxylases from two Azospirillum brasilense strains,\nSp245 and Sp7 (10, 50), are somewhat different from the se-\nquences of these enzymes from the bacteria mentioned above,\nTABLE 3.

PUTIDA 1AA 1N ROOT DEVELOPMENT\n3799\n\nincluding P. putida GR12-2 (29% identity and 44% similarity),\nalthough identi\ufb01ed conserved regions are present.\nTo understand how microbial 1AA in\ufb02uences plant growth,\nmutants with signi\ufb01cantly reduced levels of 1AA have been\ngenerated for the phytopathogens P. syringae (9, 34), A. tume-\nfaciens (29), and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (8) and for the\nplant growth-promoting bacterium Azosprillum lipoferum (1). 1nsertional mutagenesis of the ipdc gene was used here to\nsuccessfully generate a mutant of P. putida GR12-2 that is\nde\ufb01cient in 1AA production even in the presence of trypto-\nphan, conditions under which the wild-type strain produces\ncopious amounts of 1AA.\nThe loss of the ability to produce 1AA following disruption\nof the ipdc gene con\ufb01rms that P. putida GR12-2 produces 1AA\nvia the indolepyruvic acid pathway. This provides more support\nfor the hypothesis (36) that plant growth-promoting bacteria,\nsuch as Azospirillum spp. (10) and E. cloacae (24), produce 1AA via the indolepyruvic acid pathway, in contrast to plant\npathogens, which seem to preferentially synthesize 1AA via the\nindoleacetamide pathway (25, 48). 1ndeed, rendering the ipdc\ngene inactive by insertional mutagenesis and thereby eliminat-\ning 1AA production by this pathway signi\ufb01cantly reduces the\nability of P. putida GR12-2 to promote primary root growth in\ncanola seedlings. 1t is known from application of exogenous 1AA (13, 47) or application of diluted culture extracts or low-\ndensity inocula of bacteria that produce high levels of 1AA (20,\n43) that low concentrations of 1AA can stimulate primary root\nelongation; here we demonstrate directly that bacterial 1AA\nplays a major role in promotion of root elongation when a\nbacterium is associated with its host plant. 1AA secreted by a bacterium may promote root growth\ndirectly by stimulating plant cell elongation or cell division or\nindirectly by in\ufb02uencing bacterial ACC deaminase activity.\nACC deaminase, produced by many plant growth-promoting\nbacteria (16, 44), including P. putida GR12-2 (21), is involved\nin the stimulation of root elongation in seedlings (27). ACC\ndeaminase hydrolyzes plant ACC, the immediate precursor of\nthe phytohormone ethylene, and thereby prevents the produc-\ntion of plant growth-inhibiting levels of ethylene (38). Mutants\nof plant growth-promoting bacteria that do not produce ACC\ndeaminase have lost the ability to stimulate root elongation\n(27). 1t is possible that 1AA and ACC deaminase work in\nconcert to stimulate root elongation. Exogenous 1AA is known\nto increase transcription and activity of ACC synthase (37),\nwhich catalyzes the production of ACC in plants. ACC stimu-\nlates ACC deaminase activity in bacteria (21, 26).\nThe reduced ability of 1AA-de\ufb01cient P. putida GR12-2 to\npromote canola root growth cannot be attributed to defective\ncolonization. Although Brandl and Lindow (6) showed that an 1AA mutant of E. herbicola 299R was less competitive than the\nwild-type strain for colonization of bean leaves and pear \ufb02ow-\ners, the P. putida GR12-2 1AA mutant was able to colonize\ncanola roots to the same extent as the wild-type strain follow-\ning seed inoculation.\nWhile low levels of 1AA stimulate root elongation, high\nlevels of bacterial 1AA, whether from 1AA-overproducing mu-\ntants or strains that naturally secrete high levels or from high-\ndensity inocula, stimulate the formation of lateral and adven-\ntitious roots (3, 4, 30, 33, 42, 49). P. putida GR12-2 cells that\nproduce wild-type levels of 1AA stimulated the formation of\nmany short adventitious roots on mung bean cuttings, and an 1AA-overproducing mutant stimulated the formation of even\nmore adventitious roots than the wild-type strain (33). 1n con-\ntrast, the 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida GR12-2 stimulated\nthe formation of fewer roots than the wild-type bacterium, and\nthe roots were generally longer than those induced by the\nwild-type strain. 1nitiation of adventitious and lateral roots may be mediated\nby 1AA-induced ethylene. An ACC deaminase-negative mu-\ntant of P. putida GR12-2 which cannot reduce ethylene levels\nin plants stimulated the formation of more small adventitious\nroots than the wild-type strain (33). The increase in the num-\nber of roots on the cuttings correlated with an increase in\nethylene production. The 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida\nGR12-2 may not stimulate the formation of ACC synthase and\ntherefore ethylene synthesis in plants; thus, fewer adventitious\nroots were initiated on the cuttings.\nHigh levels of exogenous or bacterial 1AA, and therefore\nhigh levels of ethylene, have also been shown to inhibit elon-\ngation growth in roots (4, 30, 41, 42, 49). Thus, while adventi-\ntious roots that formed on mung bean cuttings inoculated with\nwild-type P. putida GR12-2 were very short (most were less\nthan 1 mm long), the roots whose formation was stimulated by\nthe 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant strain were longer. The cuttings were\nexposed to a high inoculum density continuously for an ex-\ntended period of time; therefore, cuttings treated with the\nwild-type bacterium were exposed to a high level of 1AA.\nFrom a practical point of view, treatment of cuttings with an 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant may be a bene\ufb01cial method for propa-\ngation of plants. Certainly, while many adventitious roots are\ndesirable, longer roots with more surface area through which\nthe plants can absorb nutrients and water from the soil would\nbe advantageous. Treatment with the 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant of\nP. putida GR12-2 provides just such a compromise between the\nmany short roots whose formation is stimulated by the wild-\ntype strain and the few long roots produced by treatment with\nwater.\nProduction of 1AA, a plant hormone that does not appar-\nently function as a hormone in bacterial cells, may have\nevolved in bacteria because it is important in the bacterium-\nplant relationship. 1n this research we showed that bacterial 1AA stimulates the development of the host plant root system.\nThe advantage for root-associated bacteria is a rich supply of\nnutrients, as much of the metabolic products of the carbon\n\ufb01xed by plants is lost from roots and moves into the rhizo-\nsphere as exudates, lysates, and mucilage (32).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Alberto Mendoza Herrera, Centro de Biotecnolog\u0131\n\u00b4a Ge-\nno\n\u00b4mica, Reynosa, Tampico, Mexico, for HPLC measurements of 1AA.\nThis work was supported by grants to B.R.G. and by a scholarship to\nC.L.P. from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council\nof Canada and by an Ontario Graduate Scholarship in Science and\nTechnology to C.L.P.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Glick\nDepartment of Biology, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L 3G1\nReceived 7 December 2001/Accepted 12 May 2002\nMany plant-associated bacteria synthesize the phytohormone indoleacetic acid (IAA). While IAA produced\nby phytopathogenic bacteria, mainly by the indoleacetamide pathway, has been implicated in the induction of\nplant tumors, it is not clear whether IAA synthesized by bene\ufb01cial bacteria, usually via the indolepyruvic acid\npathway, is involved in plant growth promotion. To determine whether bacterial IAA enhances root develop-\nment in host plants, the ipdc gene that encodes indolepyruvate decarboxylase, a key enzyme in the indolepyruvic\nacid pathway, was isolated from the plant growth-promoting bacterium Pseudomonas putida GR12-2 and an\nIAA-de\ufb01cient mutant constructed by insertional mutagenesis. The canola seedling primary roots from seeds\ntreated with wild-type P. putida GR12-2 were on average 35 to 50% longer than the roots from seeds treated with\nthe IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant and the roots from uninoculated seeds. In addition, exposing mung bean cuttings to\nhigh levels of IAA by soaking them in a suspension of the wild-type strain stimulated the formation of many,\nvery small, adventitious roots. Formation of fewer roots was stimulated by treatment with the IAA-de\ufb01cient\nmutant. These results suggest that bacterial IAA plays a major role in the development of the host plant root\nsystem.\nBacteria that inhabit the rhizosphere may in\ufb02uence plant\ngrowth by contributing to a host plant\u2019s endogenous pool of\nphytohormones, such as auxins. Production of the auxin in-\ndoleacetic acid (IAA) is widespread among plant-associated\nbacteria (36). In phytopathogenic bacteria, such as Agrobacte-\nrium tumefaciens and pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae, IAA\nis produced from tryptophan via the intermediate indoleacet-\namide and has been implicated in the induction of plant tu-\nmors. Bene\ufb01cial bacteria synthesize IAA predominantly by an\nalternate tryptophan-dependant pathway, through indolepyru-\nvic acid; however, the role of bacterial IAA in plant growth\npromotion remains undetermined.\nPromotion of root growth is one of the major markers by\nwhich the bene\ufb01cial effect of plant growth-promoting bacteria\nis measured (15). Rapid establishment of roots, whether by\nelongation of primary roots or by proliferation of lateral and\nadventitious roots, is advantageous for young seedlings as it\nincreases their ability to anchor themselves to the soil and to\nobtain water and nutrients from their environment, thus en-\nhancing their chances for survival. Most root-promoting bac-\nteria synthesize IAA, and their effect on plants mimics that of\nexogenous IAA.\nPlants generally grow one or more primary roots from which\nlateral roots emerge by division of speci\ufb01c pericycle cells. Ad-\nventitious roots are a type of lateral root that arise from non-\nroot tissue, such as the tissue at the base of the stem or on\ncuttings. Whereas lateral and adventitious roots are induced by\nhigh concentrations of exogenous IAA, a feature exploited in\nhorticulture by applying natural and synthetic auxins, primary\nroot growth is stimulated by application of relatively low levels\nof IAA, typically between 10\u00029 and 10\u000212 M (2, 35, 39), and is\ninhibited by higher IAA concentrations, likely via auxin-in-\nduced ethylene (37).\nTwo different approaches have been taken to test for a\nsimilar trend in the effect of bacterial IAA on plant growth. In\none method the effects of inoculating roots with bacterial mu-\ntants that produce different levels of IAA are compared. In the\nsecond approach the size of the inoculum of a single strain is\nvaried; the rationale for this approach is that a higher inoculum\ndensity means that more IAA is available to the plant. While\ndemonstrating that bacterial mutants that overproduce IAA\nhave a root growth-inhibiting effect has been relatively straight-\nforward (30, 42, 49), establishing a direct relationship between\nenhanced root growth and bacterial IAA has proven to be\nmore elusive, given the dif\ufb01culty of isolating bacterial mutants\nthat are completely de\ufb01cient in IAA synthesis (1, 8, 29, 31).\nThe rhizobacterium Pseudomonas putida GR12-2 is a strong\ncandidate for development as a soil inoculant to enhance crop\nyields. Inoculation of canola, tomato, and other agriculturally\nimportant plants with this strain results in substantial promo-\ntion of seedling root growth (7, 18). Characteristics that may\ncontribute to the ability of P. putida GR12-2 to enhance plant\ngrowth include the capacity to synthesize siderophores and\nthereby provide iron for the plant (7), the capacity to lower\ngrowth-inhibiting levels of ethylene in plant tissues by produc-\ntion of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deami-\nnase (16, 21), and the capacity to secrete IAA (49).\nTo determine if IAA is involved in the stimulation of root\ngrowth by P. putida GR12-2, the ipdc gene encoding indo-\nlepyruvate decarboxylase, which catalyzes a key step in the\nindolepyruvic acid pathway for IAA synthesis, was isolated,\nand an IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant was constructed by insertional\nmutagenesis of ipdc. Changes in root development as a conse-\nquence of root interactions with this mutant were documented\nand compared to the effects of the wild-type bacterium.\n* Corresponding author.

(Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada) and\nwas routinely grown at 27\u00b0C in 3.6% tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Difco). The DF\nsalts minimal medium of Dworkin and Foster (12) was also used for propagation\nof P. putida GR12-2 as indicated below. Escherichia coli DH5\u0003 (19) was grown\nat 37\u00b0C in 2% Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Difco).\nIsolation of the ipdc gene by PCR. The following PCR primers were designed\nfrom the previously published Enterobacter cloacae FERM BP-1529 ipdc gene\nsequence (24) to span the entire open reading frame: forward primer 5\u0004 GAA\nGGATCCCTGTTATGCGAACC 3\u0004 and reverse primer 5\u0004 CTGGGGATCCG\nACAAGTAATCAGGC 3\u0004 (MOBIX, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario,\nCanada). A BamHI restriction site (underlined) was incorporated into the 5\u0004 end\nof both the forward and reverse primers in order to facilitate subsequent sub-\ncloning of PCR products. These primers were used to amplify the ipdc gene from\nboth lysed cells of P. putida GR12-2 and puri\ufb01ed P. putida GR12-2 genomic\nDNA. PCR products were sequenced (MOBIX, McMaster University), and the\nsequence was analyzed by using the algorithms BLAST (National Center for\nBiotechnology Information [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]) and ClustalW (EMBL\n[http://www.ebi.ac.uk]).\nMarker exchange mutagenesis. The ipdc sequence was subcloned into the\nsuicide vector pJQ200 (40) and then disrupted by insertion of a gene for kana-\nmycin resistance carried on a 2.3-kb EcoRI fragment from pHP45\u0005-Km (14) into\nthe unique PmlI site roughly in the middle of ipdc. The resultant plasmid,\npJQIPDC-Kan, was \ufb01rst introduced into E. coli S17.1 (45) competent cells and\nselected for by resistance to gentamicin (30 \u0006g/ml) and kanamycin (50 \u0006g/ml),\nand then it was transferred to P. putida GR12-2 by \ufb01lter mating. Transconjugants\nwere identi\ufb01ed by growth on Simmons citrate agar supplemented with kanamy-\ncin and then on DF salts minimal medium agar plus kanamycin for veri\ufb01cation.\nTo select for transconjugants in which the functional ipdc gene in the chromo-\nsome was replaced by the disrupted ipdc gene from the plasmid by double\ncrossover between homologous ipdc sequences, colonies resistant to the lethal\neffects of the vector-encoded sacB gene product in the presence of sucrose were\nidenti\ufb01ed on tryptic soy agar containing kanamycin and 5% (wt/vol) sucrose. In\naddition, these colonies were plated on tryptic soy agar supplemented with\ngentamicin; lack of growth con\ufb01rmed the absence of gentamicin acetyltrans-\nferase also encoded on the vector. Insertion of the kanamycin resistance gene\ninto the chromosomal ipdc gene was veri\ufb01ed by PCR and by Southern hybrid-\nization.\nQuanti\ufb01cation of IAA production. Wild-type and IAA-de\ufb01cient P. putida\nGR12-2 were propagated overnight in 5 ml of DF salts minimal media, and then\n20-\u0006l aliquots were transferred into 5 ml of DF salts minimal media supple-\nmented with the following concentrations of L-tryptophan (from a \ufb01lter-sterilized\n2-mg/ml stock prepared in warm water; Sigma): 0, 50, 100, 200, and 500 \u0006g/ml.\nAfter incubation for 42 h, the density of each culture was measured spectropho-\ntometrically at 600 nm, and then the bacterial cells were removed from the\nculture medium by centrifugation (5,500 \u0007 g, 10 min). A 1-ml aliquot of the\nsupernatant was mixed vigorously with 4 ml of Salkowski\u2019s reagent (150 ml of\nconcentrated H2SO4, 250 ml of distilled H2O, 7.5 ml of 0.5 M FeCl3\u00b76H2O [17])\nand allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min before the absorbance at\n535 nm was measured. The concentration of IAA in each culture medium was\ndetermined by comparison with a standard curve.\nTo con\ufb01rm that the mutant strain does not produce IAA when high concen-\ntrations of tryptophan are present, the IAA levels in the supernatants from\nwild-type and mutant cultures grown in the DF salts minimal medium containing\n500 \u0006g of L-tryptophan per ml were measured by high-performance liquid chro-\nmatography (HPLC). Filtered supernatant was analyzed by using a Hewlett-\nPackard model 1100 HPLC equipped with an Ultrasphere reverse-phase C18\ncolumn (5 \u0006m; 4.6 by 150 mm); the mobile phase was acetonitrile\u201350 mM\nKH2PO4 (pH 3) (30/70) at a \ufb02ow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluates were detected at 220\nnm, and IAA was quanti\ufb01ed by integrating the areas under the peaks; authentic\nIAA (Sigma) was used as a standard. The IAA produced by each strain was\nmeasured in triplicate.\nRoot elongation assay. Cultures of wild-type and IAA-de\ufb01cient P. putida\nGR12-2 were grown overnight from single colonies in 5 ml of DF salts minimal\nmedia without and with kanamycin, respectively. After approximately 24 h, 20 \u0006l\nof each culture was transferred to 5 ml of DF salts minimal medium supple-\nmented with tryptophan (200 \u0006g/ml) to induce IAA production and incubated\nfor an additional 42 h. The turbidities of the cultures were measured spectro-\nphotometrically at 600 nm before the bacterial cells were separated from the\nculture medium by centrifugation. Each supernatant was immediately assayed to\ndetermine the IAA concentration by Salkowski\u2019s assay as described above. Cells\nwere washed twice in 5 ml of sterile 0.03 M MgSO4, and the \ufb01nal suspension\nwas adjusted to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5 with 0.03 M MgSO4.\nCanola seeds (Hyola 401), kindly provided by J. Omielan (University of\nGuelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada), were prepared and inoculated by the meth-\nod outlined by Lifshitz et al. (28), with some modi\ufb01cations (7). Approximately\n300 seeds, previously stored in a desiccator at 4\u00b0C, were surface sterilized by\nsoaking them in 10 ml of 70% ethanol for 1 min and then in 10 ml of 1% sodium\nhypochlorite (bleach) for 10 min. To remove the residual bleach, the seeds were\nwashed \ufb01ve times with sterile distilled water. For each treatment, approximately\n100 seeds were transferred aseptically to sterile polystyrene petri dishes and\nincubated with 5 ml of either the wild-type or mutant bacterial suspension at\nroom temperature for 1 h to allow the bacteria to bind to the seed coat and for\nseed imbibition. Seeds were also incubated in 5 ml of 0.03 M MgSO4 under the\nsame conditions as a control.\nSix seeds were aseptically placed in each growth pouch (Mega Interna-\ntional, Mimeapolis, Mim.), which had been previously \ufb01lled with 10 ml of\ndistilled water and autoclaved. For each treatment, 10 pouches were pre-\npared. The pouches were placed upright in metal racks, with one treatment\nper rack to prevent cross-contamination, and there were two empty pouches\nat each end, of each rack. The racks were set in a plastic bin containing about\n3 cm of deionized water and covered loosely with plastic wrap to prevent\ndehydration. The pouches were incubated in a growth chamber at 20\u00b0C with\na daily cycle consisting of 12 h of darkness followed by 12 h of light (18 \u0006mol\nof photons/m2/s). For the \ufb01rst 2 days, the seeds were kept in the dark by\ncovering the pouches with aluminum foil. After 5 days, shoot and primary\nroot lengths were measured and analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (F\nvalues are indicated below). Seeds that had failed to germinate 3 days after\nthey were sown were marked, and shoots and roots that subsequently devel-\noped from these seeds were not measured.\nColonization assay. To determine if the IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida\nGR12-2 is impaired in the ability to colonize roots, canola seeds were inoculated\nwith either wild-type P. putida GR12-2 or the IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida\nGR12-2 or with a 1:1 mixture of the wild-type and mutant strains. Bacteria and\nseeds were prepared, inoculated, and incubated as described above for the root\nelongation assay. After 7 days, bacteria were extracted from six roots for each\ntreatment (two roots from each of three growth pouches) by brie\ufb02y rinsing the\nroots in sterile water and then suspending the roots in 1 ml of phosphate buffer\n(25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM Na2HPO4; pH 7.0) and shaking the preparations\nvigorously for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Dilutions were prepared in phosphate buffer and spread\nonto LB agar to determine total bacterial counts and onto LB agar containing\nkanamycin (50 \u0006g/ml) to determine mutant counts.\nRooting assay. The effects of wild-type P. putida GR12-2 and the IAA-de\ufb01-\ncient mutant of P. putida GR12-2 on the development of adventitious roots\non mung bean cuttings were assessed by using the method outlined by Mayak\net al. (33). Mung bean (Vigna radiata) seeds were surface sterilized in a\nmamer similar to that used for canola seeds as described above. Seeds were\nimbibed for 1 h in sterile distilled water, sown in sterile vermiculite, and then\nincubated in a growth chamber as described above. After 7 days, the portions of\nthe seedlings above the surface of the vermiculite were excised with a razor blade\nand placed immediately in either water or a bacterial suspension prepared as\nfollows.\nFive milliliters of DF salts minimal medium was inoculated with the wild-\ntype or the IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida GR12-2 and incubated over-\nnight. Eighty microliters of each overnight culture was transferred to 20 ml of\nDF salts minimal medium containing tryptophan (200 \u0006g/ml) and incubated\nfor an additional 42 h. Cells were washed twice with sterile distilled water and\nresuspended in sterile water to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5.\nThree milliliters of each bacterial preparation was transferred to each of 10\nborosilicate glass tubes (10 by 75 mm), and 10 additional tubes were \ufb01lled\nwith 3 ml of sterile distilled water. One mung bean cutting was placed in each\ntube (a total of 10 cuttings per treatment), and the tubes were placed in a\nrack, covered loosely with plastic wrap to prevent evaporation, and incubated\nin the growth chamber under the conditions described above. After 8 days,\nthe cuttings were rinsed brie\ufb02y with distilled water, and the numbers and\nlengths of adventitious roots were measured by using a magnifying glass; the\ndata were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (F values are indicated\nbelow).\nNucleotide sequence accession number. The sequence of the P. putida GR12-2\nipdc gene reported in this paper has been deposited in the GenBank database\nunder accession number AF285632.\n3796\nPATTEN AND GLICK\nAPPL. ENVIRON. MICROBIOL.\n\nRESULTS\nIsolation of the ipdc gene. Hybridization of a P. putida\nGR12-2 genomic library (prepared by ligation of Sau3AI-di-\ngested fragments of total DNA with pUC19 and transforma-\ntion of E. coli DH5\u0003) with the indolepyruvate decarboxylase\n(ipdc) gene from E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 (24) revealed a\nsingle colony carrying 200 bp of the ipdc sequence. The se-\nquence was 98% identical at the nucleotide level to the 3\u0004 end\nof the E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 ipdc gene. The region down-\nstream of the ipdc gene contains a putative transcription ter-\nmination signal, identi\ufb01ed by the presence of sequences capa-\nble of forming a stable stem-loop structure in the mRNA and\na sequence 72% identical at the nucleotide level to an open\nreading frame in E. coli of unknown function (accession no.\nAE000327) on the opposite strand. Working on the assump-\ntion that the high degree of identity between the 3\u0004 ends of the\nP. putida GR12-2 and E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 ipdc se-\nquences could be extended to the entire gene, we designed\nPCR primers from the previously published E. cloacae FERM\nBP-1529 sequence to amplify the entire open reading frame.\nElectrophoresis of the PCR products obtained by using P.\nputida GR12-2 genomic DNA or cell lysates as templates re-\nvealed a single band of the expected size, about 1.7 kb. Se-\nquence analysis of the PCR products and alignment of the\nnucleotide sequence with the ipdc gene from E. cloacae FERM\nBP-1529 con\ufb01rmed that the P. putida GR12-2 ipdc gene had\nindeed been isolated. Furthermore, the translated amino acid\nsequence is similar to the amino acid sequences of other\nknown bacterial indolepyruvate decarboxylases (Fig. 1).\nThe P. putida GR12-2 indolepyruvate decarboxylase is also\nsimilar to pyruvate decarboxylases from Zymomonas mobilis\nand Saccharomyces cerevisiae, exhibiting substantial levels of\nidentity (33 and 36%, respectively) and similarity (51 and 53%,\nrespectively) in the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). Four of the\nsix residues believed to be involved in substrate binding and\ncatalysis of pyruvate decarboxylase are conserved in the in-\ndolepyruvate decarboxylase sequence; residues Asp29, His115,\nHis116, and Glu468 of indolepyruvate decarboxylase from P. pu-\ntida GR12-2 correspond to residues Asp27, His113, His114, and\nGlu473 in the active site of Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase\n(11) (Fig. 1). In addition, most of the residues known to bind\nthe cofactors Mg2\u0001 and thiamine diphosphate in pyruvate de-\ncarboxylase are conserved in indolepyruvate decarboxylase;\nthese residues include Glu52, Gly408, Asp435, Asn462, and\nGly464.\nConstruction of an IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant. Vector pJQ200\n(40) was used to deliver the ipdc sequence, disrupted by inser-\ntion of a gene for kanamycin resistance, into the genome of P.\nputida GR12-2. This plasmid has an origin of transfer (oriT)\nand mob genes from plasmid RP4, enabling transfer of the\nvector from E. coli S17.1 (45) into P. putida GR12-2 via con-\njugation. However, once in P. putida GR12-2, the vector can-\nnot replicate because it has an origin of replication derived\nfrom pACYC184 that is functional only in enterobacteria (40).\nThus, following transfer of the vector to P. putida GR12-2,\nkanamycin-resistant cells can arise only if the kanamycin resis-\ntance gene is inserted into the ipdc gene in the genome by\nhomologous recombination between the ipdc sequences on the\nplasmid and in the chromosome. In addition, because genta-\nmicin acetyltransferase and SacB are encoded on the vector,\nselection for the absence of these traits (that is, selection for\nsensitivity to gentamicin and resistance to the lethal effects of\nSacB in the presence of sucrose) selects against the incorpo-\nration of the entire plasmid into the genome that would result\nfrom a single crossover event.\nFollowing the transfer of pJQIPDC-Kan from E. coli S17.1\nto P. putida GR12-2 by conjugation, transconjugants were ini-\ntially selected on Simmons citrate agar (on which E. coli donor\ncells camot grow) containing kanamycin (on which nontrans-\nformed P. putida GR12-2 cells camot grow). Several colonies\nwere picked and subcultured on DF salts minimal agar (on\nwhich E. coli camot grow) containing kanamycin to con\ufb01rm\nthat they were indeed derived from P. putida GR12-2. Growth\non TSB agar containing kanamycin and 5% sucrose and the\nlack of growth on TSB agar containing gentamicin indicated\nthat the kanamycin resistance gene, but not the remainder of\nthe plasmid, had been inserted into the chromosome in all\nselected transconjugants. Replacement of the functional ipdc\ngene in the chromosome of P. putida GR12-2 with the\nipdc gene disrupted by the kanamycin resistance gene from\npJQIPDC-Kan was con\ufb01rmed by PCR by using primers de-\nsigned to amplify the ipdc gene and whole-cell lysates of\ntransconjugants and wild-type P. putida GR12-2 as templates.\nThe PCR products from transconjugants were 2.3 kb larger,\ncorresponding to the size of the kanamycin resistance gene\nfragment, than the PCR products from the wild-type strain\n(data not shown); the PCR products were con\ufb01rmed to contain\nthe ipdc sequence by Southern hybridization (data not shown).\nIn addition, Southern hybridization con\ufb01rmed the presence of\na larger EcoRI fragment carrying the ipdc gene in the chro-\nmosome of the mutant strain than in the chromosome of the\nwild-type bacterium (data not shown).\nQuanti\ufb01cation of IAA production. In the absence of trypto-\nphan supplements, both the IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant and wild-\ntype P. putida GR12-2 produced very low levels of IAA (Table\n1). However, when both strains were grown in the presence of\n50 \u0006g of tryptophan per ml for approximately 42 h, wild-type\nP. putida GR12-2 responded by producing higher levels of\nIAA, while the mutant was not capable of producing signi\ufb01cant\namounts of IAA (Table 1). As the concentration of tryptophan\nin the growth medium was increased, IAA production by the\nwild-type strain increased. In contrast, IAA production by the\nmutant strain remained very low. Measurement of IAA by\nHPLC con\ufb01rmed that in the presence of a high concentration\nof tryptophan (500 \u0006g/ml), the wild-type bacterium produced\nhigh levels of IAA (68.3 \b 2.2 \u0006g/ml/OD600 unit), while IAA\nwas not detected in the medium from mutant cells (\t1 \u0006g/ml/\nOD600 unit). The apparent slight increase in IAA concentra-\ntion in the medium in mutant cultures containing 500 \u0006g of\ntryptophan per ml, as measured colorimetrically by reaction\nwith Salkowski\u2019s reagent (Table 1), may have been due to\naccumulation of indolepyruvic acid, which can also react with\nSalkowski\u2019s reagent, albeit to a much lesser extent than IAA\n(data not shown). Indolepyruvic acid is the product of catalysis\nof tryptophan by tryptophan transaminase, the \ufb01rst step in the\nIAA biosynthetic pathway, and is the substrate for indolepyru-\nvate decarboxylase, which is not functional in the mutant.\nGrowth of the mutant and wild-type P. putida GR12-2 was not\nVOL. 68, 2002\nROLE OF P.

IAA produced by P. putida\nGR12-2 has a signi\ufb01cant impact on the ability of this bacterium\nto stimulate the growth of the primary roots of canola seed-\nlings. Whereas the roots from seeds treated with wild-type\nP. putida GR12-2 were on average 35% longer than the roots\nfrom uninoculated control seeds after 5 days (P \t 0.01; F1/8 \n30.1), the lengths of roots from seeds treated with the IAA-\nde\ufb01cient mutant were not different from the lengths of roots\nfrom uninoculated control seeds (P \t 0.01; F1/8 \n 4.3) (Table\n2). IAA produced by the wild-type strain had no effect on shoot\nlength, as the lengths of shoots from seeds inoculated with\nwild-type P. putida GR12-2 were not different from the lengths\nof shoots from uninoculated seeds (F1/4 \n 5.1) (Table 2). Thus,\nas expected, eliminating IAA production did not affect shoot\nlength (F1/4 \n 3.9).\nThe loss of the capacity to synthesize IAA did not reduce the\nability of IAA-de\ufb01cient P. putida GR12-2 to colonize canola\nseedling roots. The population size attained by the mutant\nbacterium on the surface of roots 7 days after seed inoculation\nwas similar to that attained by the wild-type strain when it was\ninoculated alone (Table 3). In addition, the relative population\nsizes were maintained on the roots when the seeds were coin-\noculated with equal amounts of the two strains (Table 3).\nRooting assay. Mung bean cuttings that were excised above\nthe roots after 7 days of growth in vermiculite and placed in\neither water or a bacterial suspension had visible roots at the\nbase of the stem after 5 days. After 8 days, the cuttings in water\nhad a few long roots (on average, about seven 3.4-mm-long\nroots growing just above the base) (Table 4). More than three\ntimes as many adventitious roots developed on cuttings placed\nin a suspension of wild-type P. putida GR12-2. Most of these\nroots were very small (less than 1 mm long) and were distrib-\nuted over several centimeters up from the base of the stem;\nsometimes there were a few longer roots right at the base.\nRoots that developed in the suspension of the IAA-de\ufb01cient\nmutant of P. putida GR12-2 were both abundant and long; this\nis likely the best situation for propagation of cuttings in the\nlong term. Twice as many roots were present on these cuttings\nas on the cuttings growing in water, and the roots were gener-\nally longer than those that developed in the wild-type bacterial\nsuspension (Table 4).\nDISCUSSION\nThe amino acid sequence determined from the ipdc gene\nisolated from P. putida GR12-2 reveals a 552-amino-acid pro-\ntein with a predicted molecular weight of approximately\n60,000. This protein is not transcribed from an operon con-\ntaining the other genes involved in the biosynthesis of IAA by\nthe indolepyruvic acid pathway as it is transcribed from its own\npromoter (unpublished data) and has a transcription termina-\ntion sequence just downstream of the translation stop codon. It\nis reasonable to conclude that the enzymes involved in the\nindolepyruvic acid pathway are not expressed from an operon\nbecause multiple copies of the gene encoding the \ufb01rst enzyme\nin the pathway, an aromatic aminotransferase, are often pres-\nent in a single bacterium, and the enzyme prefers amino acid\nsubstrates other than tryptophan (22, 23, 46). Thus, this aro-\nmatic aminotransferase is not solely an IAA biosynthesis en-\nzyme.\nThe sequence of indolepyruvate decarboxylase from P. pu-\ntida GR12-2 is similar to the sequence of indolepyruvate de-\ncarboxylase from E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 (99% identity),\nwhich was isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumber (24), and\nto the sequence of the same protein from Erwinia herbicola\n299R (57% identity and 71% similarity), an epiphytic bacte-\nrium isolated from pear (5). The sequences of the indolepyru-\nvate decarboxylases from two Azospirillum brasilense strains,\nSp245 and Sp7 (10, 50), are somewhat different from the se-\nquences of these enzymes from the bacteria mentioned above,\nTABLE 3.

PUTIDA IAA IN ROOT DEVELOPMENT\n3799\n\nincluding P. putida GR12-2 (29% identity and 44% similarity),\nalthough identi\ufb01ed conserved regions are present.\nTo understand how microbial IAA in\ufb02uences plant growth,\nmutants with signi\ufb01cantly reduced levels of IAA have been\ngenerated for the phytopathogens P. syringae (9, 34), A. tume-\nfaciens (29), and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (8) and for the\nplant growth-promoting bacterium Azosprillum lipoferum (1).\nInsertional mutagenesis of the ipdc gene was used here to\nsuccessfully generate a mutant of P. putida GR12-2 that is\nde\ufb01cient in IAA production even in the presence of trypto-\nphan, conditions under which the wild-type strain produces\ncopious amounts of IAA.\nThe loss of the ability to produce IAA following disruption\nof the ipdc gene con\ufb01rms that P. putida GR12-2 produces IAA\nvia the indolepyruvic acid pathway. This provides more support\nfor the hypothesis (36) that plant growth-promoting bacteria,\nsuch as Azospirillum spp. (10) and E. cloacae (24), produce\nIAA via the indolepyruvic acid pathway, in contrast to plant\npathogens, which seem to preferentially synthesize IAA via the\nindoleacetamide pathway (25, 48). Indeed, rendering the ipdc\ngene inactive by insertional mutagenesis and thereby eliminat-\ning IAA production by this pathway signi\ufb01cantly reduces the\nability of P. putida GR12-2 to promote primary root growth in\ncanola seedlings. It is known from application of exogenous\nIAA (13, 47) or application of diluted culture extracts or low-\ndensity inocula of bacteria that produce high levels of IAA (20,\n43) that low concentrations of IAA can stimulate primary root\nelongation; here we demonstrate directly that bacterial IAA\nplays a major role in promotion of root elongation when a\nbacterium is associated with its host plant.\nIAA secreted by a bacterium may promote root growth\ndirectly by stimulating plant cell elongation or cell division or\nindirectly by in\ufb02uencing bacterial ACC deaminase activity.\nACC deaminase, produced by many plant growth-promoting\nbacteria (16, 44), including P. putida GR12-2 (21), is involved\nin the stimulation of root elongation in seedlings (27). ACC\ndeaminase hydrolyzes plant ACC, the immediate precursor of\nthe phytohormone ethylene, and thereby prevents the produc-\ntion of plant growth-inhibiting levels of ethylene (38). Mutants\nof plant growth-promoting bacteria that do not produce ACC\ndeaminase have lost the ability to stimulate root elongation\n(27). It is possible that IAA and ACC deaminase work in\nconcert to stimulate root elongation. Exogenous IAA is known\nto increase transcription and activity of ACC synthase (37),\nwhich catalyzes the production of ACC in plants. ACC stimu-\nlates ACC deaminase activity in bacteria (21, 26).\nThe reduced ability of IAA-de\ufb01cient P. putida GR12-2 to\npromote canola root growth camot be attributed to defective\ncolonization. Although Brandl and Lindow (6) showed that an\nIAA mutant of E. herbicola 299R was less competitive than the\nwild-type strain for colonization of bean leaves and pear \ufb02ow-\ners, the P. putida GR12-2 IAA mutant was able to colonize\ncanola roots to the same extent as the wild-type strain follow-\ning seed inoculation.\nWhile low levels of IAA stimulate root elongation, high\nlevels of bacterial IAA, whether from IAA-overproducing mu-\ntants or strains that naturally secrete high levels or from high-\ndensity inocula, stimulate the formation of lateral and adven-\ntitious roots (3, 4, 30, 33, 42, 49). P. putida GR12-2 cells that\nproduce wild-type levels of IAA stimulated the formation of\nmany short adventitious roots on mung bean cuttings, and an\nIAA-overproducing mutant stimulated the formation of even\nmore adventitious roots than the wild-type strain (33). In con-\ntrast, the IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida GR12-2 stimulated\nthe formation of fewer roots than the wild-type bacterium, and\nthe roots were generally longer than those induced by the\nwild-type strain.\nInitiation of adventitious and lateral roots may be mediated\nby IAA-induced ethylene. An ACC deaminase-negative mu-\ntant of P. putida GR12-2 which camot reduce ethylene levels\nin plants stimulated the formation of more small adventitious\nroots than the wild-type strain (33). The increase in the num-\nber of roots on the cuttings correlated with an increase in\nethylene production. The IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida\nGR12-2 may not stimulate the formation of ACC synthase and\ntherefore ethylene synthesis in plants; thus, fewer adventitious\nroots were initiated on the cuttings.\nHigh levels of exogenous or bacterial IAA, and therefore\nhigh levels of ethylene, have also been shown to inhibit elon-\ngation growth in roots (4, 30, 41, 42, 49). Thus, while adventi-\ntious roots that formed on mung bean cuttings inoculated with\nwild-type P. putida GR12-2 were very short (most were less\nthan 1 mm long), the roots whose formation was stimulated by\nthe IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant strain were longer. The cuttings were\nexposed to a high inoculum density continuously for an ex-\ntended period of time; therefore, cuttings treated with the\nwild-type bacterium were exposed to a high level of IAA.\nFrom a practical point of view, treatment of cuttings with an\nIAA-de\ufb01cient mutant may be a bene\ufb01cial method for propa-\ngation of plants. Certainly, while many adventitious roots are\ndesirable, longer roots with more surface area through which\nthe plants can absorb nutrients and water from the soil would\nbe advantageous. Treatment with the IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant of\nP. putida GR12-2 provides just such a compromise between the\nmany short roots whose formation is stimulated by the wild-\ntype strain and the few long roots produced by treatment with\nwater.\nProduction of IAA, a plant hormone that does not appar-\nently function as a hormone in bacterial cells, may have\nevolved in bacteria because it is important in the bacterium-\nplant relationship. In this research we showed that bacterial\nIAA stimulates the development of the host plant root system.\nThe advantage for root-associated bacteria is a rich supply of\nnutrients, as much of the metabolic products of the carbon\n\ufb01xed by plants is lost from roots and moves into the rhizo-\nsphere as exudates, lysates, and mucilage (32).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Alberto Mendoza Herrera, Centro de Biotecnolog\u0131\n\u00b4a Ge-\nno\n\u00b4mica, Reynosa, Tampico, Mexico, for HPLC measurements of IAA.\nThis work was supported by grants to B.R.G. and by a scholarship to\nC.L.P. from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council\nof Canada and by an Ontario Graduate Scholarship in Science and\nTechnology to C.L.P.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Glick\nDepartment of Biology, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L 3G1\nReceived 7 December 2001/Accepted 12 May 2002\nMany plant-associated bacteria synthesize the phytohormone indoleacetic acid (IAA). While IAA produced\nby phytopathogenic bacteria, mainly by the indoleacetamide pathway, has been implicated in the induction of\nplant tumors, it is not clear whether IAA synthesized by bene\ufb01cial bacteria, usually via the indolepyruvic acid\npathway, is involved in plant growth promotion. To determine whether bacterial IAA enhances root develop-\nment in host plants, the ipdc gene that encodes indolepyruvate decarboxylase, a key enzyme in the indolepyruvic\nacid pathway, was isolated from the plant growth-promoting bacterium Pseudomonas putida GR12-2 and an\nIAA-de\ufb01cient mutant constructed by insertional mutagenesis. The canola seedling primary roots from seeds\ntreated with wild-type P. putida GR12-2 were on average 35 to 50% longer than the roots from seeds treated with\nthe IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant and the roots from uninoculated seeds. In addition, exposing mung bean cuttings to\nhigh levels of IAA by soaking them in a suspension of the wild-type strain stimulated the formation of many,\nvery small, adventitious roots. Formation of fewer roots was stimulated by treatment with the IAA-de\ufb01cient\nmutant. These results suggest that bacterial IAA plays a major role in the development of the host plant root\nsystem.\nBacteria that inhabit the rhizosphere may in\ufb02uence plant\ngrowth by contributing to a host plant\u2019s endogenous pool of\nphytohormones, such as auxins. Production of the auxin in-\ndoleacetic acid (IAA) is widespread among plant-associated\nbacteria (36). In phytopathogenic bacteria, such as Agrobacte-\nrium tumefaciens and pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae, IAA\nis produced from tryptophan via the intermediate indoleacet-\namide and has been implicated in the induction of plant tu-\nmors. Bene\ufb01cial bacteria synthesize IAA predominantly by an\nalternate tryptophan-dependant pathway, through indolepyru-\nvic acid; however, the role of bacterial IAA in plant growth\npromotion remains undetermined.\nPromotion of root growth is one of the major markers by\nwhich the bene\ufb01cial effect of plant growth-promoting bacteria\nis measured (15). Rapid establishment of roots, whether by\nelongation of primary roots or by proliferation of lateral and\nadventitious roots, is advantageous for young seedlings as it\nincreases their ability to anchor themselves to the soil and to\nobtain water and nutrients from their environment, thus en-\nhancing their chances for survival. Most root-promoting bac-\nteria synthesize IAA, and their effect on plants mimics that of\nexogenous IAA.\nPlants generally grow one or more primary roots from which\nlateral roots emerge by division of speci\ufb01c pericycle cells. Ad-\nventitious roots are a type of lateral root that arise from non-\nroot tissue, such as the tissue at the base of the stem or on\ncuttings. Whereas lateral and adventitious roots are induced by\nhigh concentrations of exogenous IAA, a feature exploited in\nhorticulture by applying natural and synthetic auxins, primary\nroot growth is stimulated by application of relatively low levels\nof IAA, typically between 10\u00029 and 10\u000212 M (2, 35, 39), and is\ninhibited by higher IAA concentrations, likely via auxin-in-\nduced ethylene (37).\nTwo different approaches have been taken to test for a\nsimilar trend in the effect of bacterial IAA on plant growth. In\none method the effects of inoculating roots with bacterial mu-\ntants that produce different levels of IAA are compared. In the\nsecond approach the size of the inoculum of a single strain is\nvaried; the rationale for this approach is that a higher inoculum\ndensity means that more IAA is available to the plant. While\ndemonstrating that bacterial mutants that overproduce IAA\nhave a root growth-inhibiting effect has been relatively straight-\nforward (30, 42, 49), establishing a direct relationship between\nenhanced root growth and bacterial IAA has proven to be\nmore elusive, given the dif\ufb01culty of isolating bacterial mutants\nthat are completely de\ufb01cient in IAA synthesis (1, 8, 29, 31).\nThe rhizobacterium Pseudomonas putida GR12-2 is a strong\ncandidate for development as a soil inoculant to enhance crop\nyields. Inoculation of canola, tomato, and other agriculturally\nimportant plants with this strain results in substantial promo-\ntion of seedling root growth (7, 18). Characteristics that may\ncontribute to the ability of P. putida GR12-2 to enhance plant\ngrowth include the capacity to synthesize siderophores and\nthereby provide iron for the plant (7), the capacity to lower\ngrowth-inhibiting levels of ethylene in plant tissues by produc-\ntion of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deami-\nnase (16, 21), and the capacity to secrete IAA (49).\nTo determine if IAA is involved in the stimulation of root\ngrowth by P. putida GR12-2, the ipdc gene encoding indo-\nlepyruvate decarboxylase, which catalyzes a key step in the\nindolepyruvic acid pathway for IAA synthesis, was isolated,\nand an IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant was constructed by insertional\nmutagenesis of ipdc. Changes in root development as a conse-\nquence of root interactions with this mutant were documented\nand compared to the effects of the wild-type bacterium.\n* Corresponding author.

(Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada) and\nwas routinely grown at 27\u00b0C in 3.6% tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Difco). The DF\nsalts minimal medium of Dworkin and Foster (12) was also used for propagation\nof P. putida GR12-2 as indicated below. Escherichia coli DH5\u0003 (19) was grown\nat 37\u00b0C in 2% Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Difco).\nIsolation of the ipdc gene by PCR. The following PCR primers were designed\nfrom the previously published Enterobacter cloacae FERM BP-1529 ipdc gene\nsequence (24) to span the entire open reading frame: forward primer 5\u0004 GAA\nGGATCCCTGTTATGCGAACC 3\u0004 and reverse primer 5\u0004 CTGGGGATCCG\nACAAGTAATCAGGC 3\u0004 (MOBIX, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario,\nCanada). A BamHI restriction site (underlined) was incorporated into the 5\u0004 end\nof both the forward and reverse primers in order to facilitate subsequent sub-\ncloning of PCR products. These primers were used to amplify the ipdc gene from\nboth lysed cells of P. putida GR12-2 and puri\ufb01ed P. putida GR12-2 genomic\nDNA. PCR products were sequenced (MOBIX, McMaster University), and the\nsequence was analyzed by using the algorithms BLAST (National Center for\nBiotechnology Information [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]) and ClustalW (EMBL\n[http://www.ebi.ac.uk]).\nMarker exchange mutagenesis. The ipdc sequence was subcloned into the\nsuicide vector pJQ200 (40) and then disrupted by insertion of a gene for kana-\nmycin resistance carried on a 2.3-kb EcoRI fragment from pHP45\u0005-Km (14) into\nthe unique PmlI site roughly in the middle of ipdc. The resultant plasmid,\npJQIPDC-Kan, was \ufb01rst introduced into E. coli S17.1 (45) competent cells and\nselected for by resistance to gentamicin (30 \u0006g/ml) and kanamycin (50 \u0006g/ml),\nand then it was transferred to P. putida GR12-2 by \ufb01lter mating. Transconjugants\nwere identi\ufb01ed by growth on Simmons citrate agar supplemented with kanamy-\ncin and then on DF salts minimal medium agar plus kanamycin for veri\ufb01cation.\nTo select for transconjugants in which the functional ipdc gene in the chromo-\nsome was replaced by the disrupted ipdc gene from the plasmid by double\ncrossover between homologous ipdc sequences, colonies resistant to the lethal\neffects of the vector-encoded sacB gene product in the presence of sucrose were\nidenti\ufb01ed on tryptic soy agar containing kanamycin and 5% (wt/vol) sucrose. In\naddition, these colonies were plated on tryptic soy agar supplemented with\ngentamicin; lack of growth con\ufb01rmed the absence of gentamicin acetyltrans-\nferase also encoded on the vector. Insertion of the kanamycin resistance gene\ninto the chromosomal ipdc gene was veri\ufb01ed by PCR and by Southern hybrid-\nization.\nQuanti\ufb01cation of IAA production. Wild-type and IAA-de\ufb01cient P. putida\nGR12-2 were propagated overnight in 5 ml of DF salts minimal media, and then\n20-\u0006l aliquots were transferred into 5 ml of DF salts minimal media supple-\nmented with the following concentrations of L-tryptophan (from a \ufb01lter-sterilized\n2-mg/ml stock prepared in warm water; Sigma): 0, 50, 100, 200, and 500 \u0006g/ml.\nAfter incubation for 42 h, the density of each culture was measured spectropho-\ntometrically at 600 nm, and then the bacterial cells were removed from the\nculture medium by centrifugation (5,500 \u0007 g, 10 min). A 1-ml aliquot of the\nsupernatant was mixed vigorously with 4 ml of Salkowski\u2019s reagent (150 ml of\nconcentrated H2SO4, 250 ml of distilled H2O, 7.5 ml of 0.5 M FeCl3\u00b76H2O [17])\nand allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min before the absorbance at\n535 nm was measured. The concentration of IAA in each culture medium was\ndetermined by comparison with a standard curve.\nTo con\ufb01rm that the mutant strain does not produce IAA when high concen-\ntrations of tryptophan are present, the IAA levels in the supernatants from\nwild-type and mutant cultures grown in the DF salts minimal medium containing\n500 \u0006g of L-tryptophan per ml were measured by high-performance liquid chro-\nmatography (HPLC). Filtered supernatant was analyzed by using a Hewlett-\nPackard model 1100 HPLC equipped with an Ultrasphere reverse-phase C18\ncolumn (5 \u0006m; 4.6 by 150 mm); the mobile phase was acetonitrile\u201350 mM\nKH2PO4 (pH 3) (30/70) at a \ufb02ow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluates were detected at 220\nnm, and IAA was quanti\ufb01ed by integrating the areas under the peaks; authentic\nIAA (Sigma) was used as a standard. The IAA produced by each strain was\nmeasured in triplicate.\nRoot elongation assay. Cultures of wild-type and IAA-de\ufb01cient P. putida\nGR12-2 were grown overnight from single colonies in 5 ml of DF salts minimal\nmedia without and with kanamycin, respectively. After approximately 24 h, 20 \u0006l\nof each culture was transferred to 5 ml of DF salts minimal medium supple-\nmented with tryptophan (200 \u0006g/ml) to induce IAA production and incubated\nfor an additional 42 h. The turbidities of the cultures were measured spectro-\nphotometrically at 600 nm before the bacterial cells were separated from the\nculture medium by centrifugation. Each supernatant was immediately assayed to\ndetermine the IAA concentration by Salkowski\u2019s assay as described above. Cells\nwere washed twice in 5 ml of sterile 0.03 M MgSO4, and the \ufb01nal suspension\nwas adjusted to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5 with 0.03 M MgSO4.\nCanola seeds (Hyola 401), kindly provided by J. Omielan (University of\nGuelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada), were prepared and inoculated by the meth-\nod outlined by Lifshitz et al. (28), with some modi\ufb01cations (7). Approximately\n300 seeds, previously stored in a desiccator at 4\u00b0C, were surface sterilized by\nsoaking them in 10 ml of 70% ethanol for 1 min and then in 10 ml of 1% sodium\nhypochlorite (bleach) for 10 min. To remove the residual bleach, the seeds were\nwashed \ufb01ve times with sterile distilled water. For each treatment, approximately\n100 seeds were transferred aseptically to sterile polystyrene petri dishes and\nincubated with 5 ml of either the wild-type or mutant bacterial suspension at\nroom temperature for 1 h to allow the bacteria to bind to the seed coat and for\nseed imbibition. Seeds were also incubated in 5 ml of 0.03 M MgSO4 under the\nsame conditions as a control.\nSix seeds were aseptically placed in each growth pouch (Mega Interna-\ntional, Minneapolis, Minn.), which had been previously \ufb01lled with 10 ml of\ndistilled water and autoclaved. For each treatment, 10 pouches were pre-\npared. The pouches were placed upright in metal racks, with one treatment\nper rack to prevent cross-contamination, and there were two empty pouches\nat each end, of each rack. The racks were set in a plastic bin containing about\n3 cm of deionized water and covered loosely with plastic wrap to prevent\ndehydration. The pouches were incubated in a growth chamber at 20\u00b0C with\na daily cycle consisting of 12 h of darkness followed by 12 h of light (18 \u0006mol\nof photons/m2/s). For the \ufb01rst 2 days, the seeds were kept in the dark by\ncovering the pouches with aluminum foil. After 5 days, shoot and primary\nroot lengths were measured and analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (F\nvalues are indicated below). Seeds that had failed to germinate 3 days after\nthey were sown were marked, and shoots and roots that subsequently devel-\noped from these seeds were not measured.\nColonization assay. To determine if the IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida\nGR12-2 is impaired in the ability to colonize roots, canola seeds were inoculated\nwith either wild-type P. putida GR12-2 or the IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida\nGR12-2 or with a 1:1 mixture of the wild-type and mutant strains. Bacteria and\nseeds were prepared, inoculated, and incubated as described above for the root\nelongation assay. After 7 days, bacteria were extracted from six roots for each\ntreatment (two roots from each of three growth pouches) by brie\ufb02y rinsing the\nroots in sterile water and then suspending the roots in 1 ml of phosphate buffer\n(25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM Na2HPO4; pH 7.0) and shaking the preparations\nvigorously for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Dilutions were prepared in phosphate buffer and spread\nonto LB agar to determine total bacterial counts and onto LB agar containing\nkanamycin (50 \u0006g/ml) to determine mutant counts.\nRooting assay. The effects of wild-type P. putida GR12-2 and the IAA-de\ufb01-\ncient mutant of P. putida GR12-2 on the development of adventitious roots\non mung bean cuttings were assessed by using the method outlined by Mayak\net al. (33). Mung bean (Vigna radiata) seeds were surface sterilized in a\nmanner similar to that used for canola seeds as described above. Seeds were\nimbibed for 1 h in sterile distilled water, sown in sterile vermiculite, and then\nincubated in a growth chamber as described above. After 7 days, the portions of\nthe seedlings above the surface of the vermiculite were excised with a razor blade\nand placed immediately in either water or a bacterial suspension prepared as\nfollows.\nFive milliliters of DF salts minimal medium was inoculated with the wild-\ntype or the IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida GR12-2 and incubated over-\nnight. Eighty microliters of each overnight culture was transferred to 20 ml of\nDF salts minimal medium containing tryptophan (200 \u0006g/ml) and incubated\nfor an additional 42 h. Cells were washed twice with sterile distilled water and\nresuspended in sterile water to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5.\nThree milliliters of each bacterial preparation was transferred to each of 10\nborosilicate glass tubes (10 by 75 mm), and 10 additional tubes were \ufb01lled\nwith 3 ml of sterile distilled water. One mung bean cutting was placed in each\ntube (a total of 10 cuttings per treatment), and the tubes were placed in a\nrack, covered loosely with plastic wrap to prevent evaporation, and incubated\nin the growth chamber under the conditions described above. After 8 days,\nthe cuttings were rinsed brie\ufb02y with distilled water, and the numbers and\nlengths of adventitious roots were measured by using a magnifying glass; the\ndata were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (F values are indicated\nbelow).\nNucleotide sequence accession number. The sequence of the P. putida GR12-2\nipdc gene reported in this paper has been deposited in the GenBank database\nunder accession number AF285632.\n3796\nPATTEN AND GLICK\nAPPL. ENVIRON. MICROBIOL.\n\nRESULTS\nIsolation of the ipdc gene. Hybridization of a P. putida\nGR12-2 genomic library (prepared by ligation of Sau3AI-di-\ngested fragments of total DNA with pUC19 and transforma-\ntion of E. coli DH5\u0003) with the indolepyruvate decarboxylase\n(ipdc) gene from E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 (24) revealed a\nsingle colony carrying 200 bp of the ipdc sequence. The se-\nquence was 98% identical at the nucleotide level to the 3\u0004 end\nof the E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 ipdc gene. The region down-\nstream of the ipdc gene contains a putative transcription ter-\nmination signal, identi\ufb01ed by the presence of sequences capa-\nble of forming a stable stem-loop structure in the mRNA and\na sequence 72% identical at the nucleotide level to an open\nreading frame in E. coli of unknown function (accession no.\nAE000327) on the opposite strand. Working on the assump-\ntion that the high degree of identity between the 3\u0004 ends of the\nP. putida GR12-2 and E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 ipdc se-\nquences could be extended to the entire gene, we designed\nPCR primers from the previously published E. cloacae FERM\nBP-1529 sequence to amplify the entire open reading frame.\nElectrophoresis of the PCR products obtained by using P.\nputida GR12-2 genomic DNA or cell lysates as templates re-\nvealed a single band of the expected size, about 1.7 kb. Se-\nquence analysis of the PCR products and alignment of the\nnucleotide sequence with the ipdc gene from E. cloacae FERM\nBP-1529 con\ufb01rmed that the P. putida GR12-2 ipdc gene had\nindeed been isolated. Furthermore, the translated amino acid\nsequence is similar to the amino acid sequences of other\nknown bacterial indolepyruvate decarboxylases (Fig. 1).\nThe P. putida GR12-2 indolepyruvate decarboxylase is also\nsimilar to pyruvate decarboxylases from Zymomonas mobilis\nand Saccharomyces cerevisiae, exhibiting substantial levels of\nidentity (33 and 36%, respectively) and similarity (51 and 53%,\nrespectively) in the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). Four of the\nsix residues believed to be involved in substrate binding and\ncatalysis of pyruvate decarboxylase are conserved in the in-\ndolepyruvate decarboxylase sequence; residues Asp29, His115,\nHis116, and Glu468 of indolepyruvate decarboxylase from P. pu-\ntida GR12-2 correspond to residues Asp27, His113, His114, and\nGlu473 in the active site of Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase\n(11) (Fig. 1). In addition, most of the residues known to bind\nthe cofactors Mg2\u0001 and thiamine diphosphate in pyruvate de-\ncarboxylase are conserved in indolepyruvate decarboxylase;\nthese residues include Glu52, Gly408, Asp435, Asn462, and\nGly464.\nConstruction of an IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant. Vector pJQ200\n(40) was used to deliver the ipdc sequence, disrupted by inser-\ntion of a gene for kanamycin resistance, into the genome of P.\nputida GR12-2. This plasmid has an origin of transfer (oriT)\nand mob genes from plasmid RP4, enabling transfer of the\nvector from E. coli S17.1 (45) into P. putida GR12-2 via con-\njugation. However, once in P. putida GR12-2, the vector can-\nnot replicate because it has an origin of replication derived\nfrom pACYC184 that is functional only in enterobacteria (40).\nThus, following transfer of the vector to P. putida GR12-2,\nkanamycin-resistant cells can arise only if the kanamycin resis-\ntance gene is inserted into the ipdc gene in the genome by\nhomologous recombination between the ipdc sequences on the\nplasmid and in the chromosome. In addition, because genta-\nmicin acetyltransferase and SacB are encoded on the vector,\nselection for the absence of these traits (that is, selection for\nsensitivity to gentamicin and resistance to the lethal effects of\nSacB in the presence of sucrose) selects against the incorpo-\nration of the entire plasmid into the genome that would result\nfrom a single crossover event.\nFollowing the transfer of pJQIPDC-Kan from E. coli S17.1\nto P. putida GR12-2 by conjugation, transconjugants were ini-\ntially selected on Simmons citrate agar (on which E. coli donor\ncells cannot grow) containing kanamycin (on which nontrans-\nformed P. putida GR12-2 cells cannot grow). Several colonies\nwere picked and subcultured on DF salts minimal agar (on\nwhich E. coli cannot grow) containing kanamycin to con\ufb01rm\nthat they were indeed derived from P. putida GR12-2. Growth\non TSB agar containing kanamycin and 5% sucrose and the\nlack of growth on TSB agar containing gentamicin indicated\nthat the kanamycin resistance gene, but not the remainder of\nthe plasmid, had been inserted into the chromosome in all\nselected transconjugants. Replacement of the functional ipdc\ngene in the chromosome of P. putida GR12-2 with the\nipdc gene disrupted by the kanamycin resistance gene from\npJQIPDC-Kan was con\ufb01rmed by PCR by using primers de-\nsigned to amplify the ipdc gene and whole-cell lysates of\ntransconjugants and wild-type P. putida GR12-2 as templates.\nThe PCR products from transconjugants were 2.3 kb larger,\ncorresponding to the size of the kanamycin resistance gene\nfragment, than the PCR products from the wild-type strain\n(data not shown); the PCR products were con\ufb01rmed to contain\nthe ipdc sequence by Southern hybridization (data not shown).\nIn addition, Southern hybridization con\ufb01rmed the presence of\na larger EcoRI fragment carrying the ipdc gene in the chro-\nmosome of the mutant strain than in the chromosome of the\nwild-type bacterium (data not shown).\nQuanti\ufb01cation of IAA production. In the absence of trypto-\nphan supplements, both the IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant and wild-\ntype P. putida GR12-2 produced very low levels of IAA (Table\n1). However, when both strains were grown in the presence of\n50 \u0006g of tryptophan per ml for approximately 42 h, wild-type\nP. putida GR12-2 responded by producing higher levels of\nIAA, while the mutant was not capable of producing signi\ufb01cant\namounts of IAA (Table 1). As the concentration of tryptophan\nin the growth medium was increased, IAA production by the\nwild-type strain increased. In contrast, IAA production by the\nmutant strain remained very low. Measurement of IAA by\nHPLC con\ufb01rmed that in the presence of a high concentration\nof tryptophan (500 \u0006g/ml), the wild-type bacterium produced\nhigh levels of IAA (68.3 \b 2.2 \u0006g/ml/OD600 unit), while IAA\nwas not detected in the medium from mutant cells (\t1 \u0006g/ml/\nOD600 unit). The apparent slight increase in IAA concentra-\ntion in the medium in mutant cultures containing 500 \u0006g of\ntryptophan per ml, as measured colorimetrically by reaction\nwith Salkowski\u2019s reagent (Table 1), may have been due to\naccumulation of indolepyruvic acid, which can also react with\nSalkowski\u2019s reagent, albeit to a much lesser extent than IAA\n(data not shown).

IAA produced by P. putida\nGR12-2 has a signi\ufb01cant impact on the ability of this bacterium\nto stimulate the growth of the primary roots of canola seed-\nlings. Whereas the roots from seeds treated with wild-type\nP. putida GR12-2 were on average 35% longer than the roots\nfrom uninoculated control seeds after 5 days (P \t 0.01; F1/8 \n30.1), the lengths of roots from seeds treated with the IAA-\nde\ufb01cient mutant were not different from the lengths of roots\nfrom uninoculated control seeds (P \t 0.01; F1/8 \n 4.3) (Table\n2). IAA produced by the wild-type strain had no effect on shoot\nlength, as the lengths of shoots from seeds inoculated with\nwild-type P. putida GR12-2 were not different from the lengths\nof shoots from uninoculated seeds (F1/4 \n 5.1) (Table 2). Thus,\nas expected, eliminating IAA production did not affect shoot\nlength (F1/4 \n 3.9).\nThe loss of the capacity to synthesize IAA did not reduce the\nability of IAA-de\ufb01cient P. putida GR12-2 to colonize canola\nseedling roots. The population size attained by the mutant\nbacterium on the surface of roots 7 days after seed inoculation\nwas similar to that attained by the wild-type strain when it was\ninoculated alone (Table 3). In addition, the relative population\nsizes were maintained on the roots when the seeds were coin-\noculated with equal amounts of the two strains (Table 3).\nRooting assay. Mung bean cuttings that were excised above\nthe roots after 7 days of growth in vermiculite and placed in\neither water or a bacterial suspension had visible roots at the\nbase of the stem after 5 days. After 8 days, the cuttings in water\nhad a few long roots (on average, about seven 3.4-mm-long\nroots growing just above the base) (Table 4). More than three\ntimes as many adventitious roots developed on cuttings placed\nin a suspension of wild-type P. putida GR12-2. Most of these\nroots were very small (less than 1 mm long) and were distrib-\nuted over several centimeters up from the base of the stem;\nsometimes there were a few longer roots right at the base.\nRoots that developed in the suspension of the IAA-de\ufb01cient\nmutant of P. putida GR12-2 were both abundant and long; this\nis likely the best situation for propagation of cuttings in the\nlong term. Twice as many roots were present on these cuttings\nas on the cuttings growing in water, and the roots were gener-\nally longer than those that developed in the wild-type bacterial\nsuspension (Table 4).\nDISCUSSION\nThe amino acid sequence determined from the ipdc gene\nisolated from P. putida GR12-2 reveals a 552-amino-acid pro-\ntein with a predicted molecular weight of approximately\n60,000. This protein is not transcribed from an operon con-\ntaining the other genes involved in the biosynthesis of IAA by\nthe indolepyruvic acid pathway as it is transcribed from its own\npromoter (unpublished data) and has a transcription termina-\ntion sequence just downstream of the translation stop codon. It\nis reasonable to conclude that the enzymes involved in the\nindolepyruvic acid pathway are not expressed from an operon\nbecause multiple copies of the gene encoding the \ufb01rst enzyme\nin the pathway, an aromatic aminotransferase, are often pres-\nent in a single bacterium, and the enzyme prefers amino acid\nsubstrates other than tryptophan (22, 23, 46). Thus, this aro-\nmatic aminotransferase is not solely an IAA biosynthesis en-\nzyme.\nThe sequence of indolepyruvate decarboxylase from P. pu-\ntida GR12-2 is similar to the sequence of indolepyruvate de-\ncarboxylase from E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 (99% identity),\nwhich was isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumber (24), and\nto the sequence of the same protein from Erwinia herbicola\n299R (57% identity and 71% similarity), an epiphytic bacte-\nrium isolated from pear (5). The sequences of the indolepyru-\nvate decarboxylases from two Azospirillum brasilense strains,\nSp245 and Sp7 (10, 50), are somewhat different from the se-\nquences of these enzymes from the bacteria mentioned above,\nTABLE 3.

PUTIDA IAA IN ROOT DEVELOPMENT\n3799\n\nincluding P. putida GR12-2 (29% identity and 44% similarity),\nalthough identi\ufb01ed conserved regions are present.\nTo understand how microbial IAA in\ufb02uences plant growth,\nmutants with signi\ufb01cantly reduced levels of IAA have been\ngenerated for the phytopathogens P. syringae (9, 34), A. tume-\nfaciens (29), and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (8) and for the\nplant growth-promoting bacterium Azosprillum lipoferum (1).\nInsertional mutagenesis of the ipdc gene was used here to\nsuccessfully generate a mutant of P. putida GR12-2 that is\nde\ufb01cient in IAA production even in the presence of trypto-\nphan, conditions under which the wild-type strain produces\ncopious amounts of IAA.\nThe loss of the ability to produce IAA following disruption\nof the ipdc gene con\ufb01rms that P. putida GR12-2 produces IAA\nvia the indolepyruvic acid pathway. This provides more support\nfor the hypothesis (36) that plant growth-promoting bacteria,\nsuch as Azospirillum spp. (10) and E. cloacae (24), produce\nIAA via the indolepyruvic acid pathway, in contrast to plant\npathogens, which seem to preferentially synthesize IAA via the\nindoleacetamide pathway (25, 48). Indeed, rendering the ipdc\ngene inactive by insertional mutagenesis and thereby eliminat-\ning IAA production by this pathway signi\ufb01cantly reduces the\nability of P. putida GR12-2 to promote primary root growth in\ncanola seedlings. It is known from application of exogenous\nIAA (13, 47) or application of diluted culture extracts or low-\ndensity inocula of bacteria that produce high levels of IAA (20,\n43) that low concentrations of IAA can stimulate primary root\nelongation; here we demonstrate directly that bacterial IAA\nplays a major role in promotion of root elongation when a\nbacterium is associated with its host plant.\nIAA secreted by a bacterium may promote root growth\ndirectly by stimulating plant cell elongation or cell division or\nindirectly by in\ufb02uencing bacterial ACC deaminase activity.\nACC deaminase, produced by many plant growth-promoting\nbacteria (16, 44), including P. putida GR12-2 (21), is involved\nin the stimulation of root elongation in seedlings (27). ACC\ndeaminase hydrolyzes plant ACC, the immediate precursor of\nthe phytohormone ethylene, and thereby prevents the produc-\ntion of plant growth-inhibiting levels of ethylene (38). Mutants\nof plant growth-promoting bacteria that do not produce ACC\ndeaminase have lost the ability to stimulate root elongation\n(27). It is possible that IAA and ACC deaminase work in\nconcert to stimulate root elongation. Exogenous IAA is known\nto increase transcription and activity of ACC synthase (37),\nwhich catalyzes the production of ACC in plants. ACC stimu-\nlates ACC deaminase activity in bacteria (21, 26).\nThe reduced ability of IAA-de\ufb01cient P. putida GR12-2 to\npromote canola root growth cannot be attributed to defective\ncolonization. Although Brandl and Lindow (6) showed that an\nIAA mutant of E. herbicola 299R was less competitive than the\nwild-type strain for colonization of bean leaves and pear \ufb02ow-\ners, the P. putida GR12-2 IAA mutant was able to colonize\ncanola roots to the same extent as the wild-type strain follow-\ning seed inoculation.\nWhile low levels of IAA stimulate root elongation, high\nlevels of bacterial IAA, whether from IAA-overproducing mu-\ntants or strains that naturally secrete high levels or from high-\ndensity inocula, stimulate the formation of lateral and adven-\ntitious roots (3, 4, 30, 33, 42, 49). P. putida GR12-2 cells that\nproduce wild-type levels of IAA stimulated the formation of\nmany short adventitious roots on mung bean cuttings, and an\nIAA-overproducing mutant stimulated the formation of even\nmore adventitious roots than the wild-type strain (33). In con-\ntrast, the IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida GR12-2 stimulated\nthe formation of fewer roots than the wild-type bacterium, and\nthe roots were generally longer than those induced by the\nwild-type strain.\nInitiation of adventitious and lateral roots may be mediated\nby IAA-induced ethylene. An ACC deaminase-negative mu-\ntant of P. putida GR12-2 which cannot reduce ethylene levels\nin plants stimulated the formation of more small adventitious\nroots than the wild-type strain (33). The increase in the num-\nber of roots on the cuttings correlated with an increase in\nethylene production. The IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida\nGR12-2 may not stimulate the formation of ACC synthase and\ntherefore ethylene synthesis in plants; thus, fewer adventitious\nroots were initiated on the cuttings.\nHigh levels of exogenous or bacterial IAA, and therefore\nhigh levels of ethylene, have also been shown to inhibit elon-\ngation growth in roots (4, 30, 41, 42, 49). Thus, while adventi-\ntious roots that formed on mung bean cuttings inoculated with\nwild-type P. putida GR12-2 were very short (most were less\nthan 1 mm long), the roots whose formation was stimulated by\nthe IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant strain were longer. The cuttings were\nexposed to a high inoculum density continuously for an ex-\ntended period of time; therefore, cuttings treated with the\nwild-type bacterium were exposed to a high level of IAA.\nFrom a practical point of view, treatment of cuttings with an\nIAA-de\ufb01cient mutant may be a bene\ufb01cial method for propa-\ngation of plants. Certainly, while many adventitious roots are\ndesirable, longer roots with more surface area through which\nthe plants can absorb nutrients and water from the soil would\nbe advantageous. Treatment with the IAA-de\ufb01cient mutant of\nP. putida GR12-2 provides just such a compromise between the\nmany short roots whose formation is stimulated by the wild-\ntype strain and the few long roots produced by treatment with\nwater.\nProduction of IAA, a plant hormone that does not appar-\nently function as a hormone in bacterial cells, may have\nevolved in bacteria because it is important in the bacterium-\nplant relationship. In this research we showed that bacterial\nIAA stimulates the development of the host plant root system.\nThe advantage for root-associated bacteria is a rich supply of\nnutrients, as much of the metabolic products of the carbon\n\ufb01xed by plants is lost from roots and moves into the rhizo-\nsphere as exudates, lysates, and mucilage (32).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Alberto Mendoza Herrera, Centro de Biotecnolog\u0131\n\u00b4a Ge-\nno\n\u00b4mica, Reynosa, Tampico, Mexico, for HPLC measurements of IAA.\nThis work was supported by grants to B.R.G. and by a scholarship to\nC.L.P. from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council\nof Canada and by an Ontario Graduate Scholarship in Science and\nTechnology to C.L.P.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Glick\nDepartment of Biology, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L 3G1\nReceived 7 December 2001/Accepted 12 May 2002\nMany plant-associated bacteria synthesize the phytohormone indoleacetic acid (IAA). While 1AA produced\nby phytopathogenic bacteria, mainly by the indoleacetamide pathway, has been implicated in the induction of\nplant tumors, it is not clear whether 1AA synthesized by bene\ufb01cial bacteria, usually via the indolepyruvic acid\npathway, is involved in plant growth promotion. To determine whether bacterial 1AA enhances root develop-\nment in host plants, the ipdc gene that encodes indolepyruvate decarboxylase, a key enzyme in the indolepyruvic\nacid pathway, was isolated from the plant growth-promoting bacterium Pseudomonas putida GR12-2 and an 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant constructed by insertional mutagenesis. The canola seedling primary roots from seeds\ntreated with wild-type P. putida GR12-2 were on average 35 to 50% longer than the roots from seeds treated with\nthe 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant and the roots from uninoculated seeds. 1n addition, exposing mung bean cuttings to\nhigh levels of 1AA by soaking them in a suspension of the wild-type strain stimulated the formation of many,\nvery small, adventitious roots. Formation of fewer roots was stimulated by treatment with the 1AA-de\ufb01cient\nmutant. These results suggest that bacterial 1AA plays a major role in the development of the host plant root\nsystem.\nBacteria that inhabit the rhizosphere may in\ufb02uence plant\ngrowth by contributing to a host plant\u2019s endogenous pool of\nphytohormones, such as auxins. Production of the auxin in-\ndoleacetic acid (IAA) is widespread among plant-associated\nbacteria (36). 1n phytopathogenic bacteria, such as Agrobacte-\nrium tumefaciens and pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae, 1AA\nis produced from tryptophan via the intermediate indoleacet-\namide and has been implicated in the induction of plant tu-\nmors. Bene\ufb01cial bacteria synthesize 1AA predominantly by an\nalternate tryptophan-dependant pathway, through indolepyru-\nvic acid; however, the role of bacterial 1AA in plant growth\npromotion remains undetermined.\nPromotion of root growth is one of the major markers by\nwhich the bene\ufb01cial effect of plant growth-promoting bacteria\nis measured (15). Rapid establishment of roots, whether by\nelongation of primary roots or by proliferation of lateral and\nadventitious roots, is advantageous for young seedlings as it\nincreases their ability to anchor themselves to the soil and to\nobtain water and nutrients from their environment, thus en-\nhancing their chances for survival. Most root-promoting bac-\nteria synthesize 1AA, and their effect on plants mimics that of\nexogenous 1AA.\nPlants generally grow one or more primary roots from which\nlateral roots emerge by division of speci\ufb01c pericycle cells. Ad-\nventitious roots are a type of lateral root that arise from non-\nroot tissue, such as the tissue at the base of the stem or on\ncuttings. Whereas lateral and adventitious roots are induced by\nhigh concentrations of exogenous 1AA, a feature exploited in\nhorticulture by applying natural and synthetic auxins, primary\nroot growth is stimulated by application of relatively low levels\nof 1AA, typically between 10\u00029 and 10\u000212 M (2, 35, 39), and is\ninhibited by higher 1AA concentrations, likely via auxin-in-\nduced ethylene (37).\nTwo different approaches have been taken to test for a\nsimilar trend in the effect of bacterial 1AA on plant growth. 1n\none method the effects of inoculating roots with bacterial mu-\ntants that produce different levels of 1AA are compared. 1n the\nsecond approach the size of the inoculum of a single strain is\nvaried; the rationale for this approach is that a higher inoculum\ndensity means that more 1AA is available to the plant. While\ndemonstrating that bacterial mutants that overproduce 1AA\nhave a root growth-inhibiting effect has been relatively straight-\nforward (30, 42, 49), establishing a direct relationship between\nenhanced root growth and bacterial 1AA has proven to be\nmore elusive, given the dif\ufb01culty of isolating bacterial mutants\nthat are completely de\ufb01cient in 1AA synthesis (1, 8, 29, 31).\nThe rhizobacterium Pseudomonas putida GR12-2 is a strong\ncandidate for development as a soil inoculant to enhance crop\nyields. 1noculation of canola, tomato, and other agriculturally\nimportant plants with this strain results in substantial promo-\ntion of seedling root growth (7, 18). Characteristics that may\ncontribute to the ability of P. putida GR12-2 to enhance plant\ngrowth include the capacity to synthesize siderophores and\nthereby provide iron for the plant (7), the capacity to lower\ngrowth-inhibiting levels of ethylene in plant tissues by produc-\ntion of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deami-\nnase (16, 21), and the capacity to secrete 1AA (49).\nTo determine if 1AA is involved in the stimulation of root\ngrowth by P. putida GR12-2, the ipdc gene encoding indo-\nlepyruvate decarboxylase, which catalyzes a key step in the\nindolepyruvic acid pathway for 1AA synthesis, was isolated,\nand an 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant was constructed by insertional\nmutagenesis of ipdc. Changes in root development as a conse-\nquence of root interactions with this mutant were documented\nand compared to the effects of the wild-type bacterium.\n* Corresponding author.

(Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada) and\nwas routinely grown at 27\u00b0C in 3.6% tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Difco). The DF\nsalts minimal medium of Dworkin and Foster (12) was also used for propagation\nof P. putida GR12-2 as indicated below. Escherichia coli DH5\u0003 (19) was grown\nat 37\u00b0C in 2% Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Difco). 1solation of the ipdc gene by PCR. The following PCR primers were designed\nfrom the previously published Enterobacter cloacae FERM BP-1529 ipdc gene\nsequence (24) to span the entire open reading frame: forward primer 5\u0004 GAA\nGGATCCCTGTTATGCGAACC 3\u0004 and reverse primer 5\u0004 CTGGGGATCCG\nACAAGTAATCAGGC 3\u0004 (MOBIX, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario,\nCanada). A BamHI restriction site (underlined) was incorporated into the 5\u0004 end\nof both the forward and reverse primers in order to facilitate subsequent sub-\ncloning of PCR products. These primers were used to amplify the ipdc gene from\nboth lysed cells of P. putida GR12-2 and puri\ufb01ed P. putida GR12-2 genomic\nDNA. PCR products were sequenced (MOBIX, McMaster University), and the\nsequence was analyzed by using the algorithms BLAST (National Center for\nBiotechnology 1nformation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]) and ClustalW (EMBL\n[http://www.ebi.ac.uk]).\nMarker exchange mutagenesis. The ipdc sequence was subcloned into the\nsuicide vector pJQ200 (40) and then disrupted by insertion of a gene for kana-\nmycin resistance carried on a 2.3-kb EcoRI fragment from pHP45\u0005-Km (14) into\nthe unique PmlI site roughly in the middle of ipdc. The resultant plasmid,\npJQIPDC-Kan, was \ufb01rst introduced into E. coli S17.1 (45) competent cells and\nselected for by resistance to gentamicin (30 \u0006g/ml) and kanamycin (50 \u0006g/ml),\nand then it was transferred to P. putida GR12-2 by \ufb01lter mating. Transconjugants\nwere identi\ufb01ed by growth on Simmons citrate agar supplemented with kanamy-\ncin and then on DF salts minimal medium agar plus kanamycin for veri\ufb01cation.\nTo select for transconjugants in which the functional ipdc gene in the chromo-\nsome was replaced by the disrupted ipdc gene from the plasmid by double\ncrossover between homologous ipdc sequences, colonies resistant to the lethal\neffects of the vector-encoded sacB gene product in the presence of sucrose were\nidenti\ufb01ed on tryptic soy agar containing kanamycin and 5% (wt/vol) sucrose. 1n\naddition, these colonies were plated on tryptic soy agar supplemented with\ngentamicin; lack of growth con\ufb01rmed the absence of gentamicin acetyltrans-\nferase also encoded on the vector. 1nsertion of the kanamycin resistance gene\ninto the chromosomal ipdc gene was veri\ufb01ed by PCR and by Southern hybrid-\nization.\nQuanti\ufb01cation of 1AA production. Wild-type and 1AA-de\ufb01cient P. putida\nGR12-2 were propagated overnight in 5 ml of DF salts minimal media, and then\n20-\u0006l aliquots were transferred into 5 ml of DF salts minimal media supple-\nmented with the following concentrations of L-tryptophan (from a \ufb01lter-sterilized\n2-mg/ml stock prepared in warm water; Sigma): 0, 50, 100, 200, and 500 \u0006g/ml.\nAfter incubation for 42 h, the density of each culture was measured spectropho-\ntometrically at 600 nm, and then the bacterial cells were removed from the\nculture medium by centrifugation (5,500 \u0007 g, 10 min). A 1-ml aliquot of the\nsupernatant was mixed vigorously with 4 ml of Salkowski\u2019s reagent (150 ml of\nconcentrated H2SO4, 250 ml of distilled H2O, 7.5 ml of 0.5 M FeCl3\u00b76H2O [17])\nand allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min before the absorbance at\n535 nm was measured. The concentration of 1AA in each culture medium was\ndetermined by comparison with a standard curve.\nTo con\ufb01rm that the mutant strain does not produce 1AA when high concen-\ntrations of tryptophan are present, the 1AA levels in the supernatants from\nwild-type and mutant cultures grown in the DF salts minimal medium containing\n500 \u0006g of L-tryptophan per ml were measured by high-performance liquid chro-\nmatography (HPLC). Filtered supernatant was analyzed by using a Hewlett-\nPackard model 1100 HPLC equipped with an Ultrasphere reverse-phase C18\ncolumn (5 \u0006m; 4.6 by 150 mm); the mobile phase was acetonitrile\u201350 mM\nKH2PO4 (pH 3) (30/70) at a \ufb02ow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluates were detected at 220\nnm, and 1AA was quanti\ufb01ed by integrating the areas under the peaks; authentic 1AA (Sigma) was used as a standard. The 1AA produced by each strain was\nmeasured in triplicate.\nRoot elongation assay. Cultures of wild-type and 1AA-de\ufb01cient P. putida\nGR12-2 were grown overnight from single colonies in 5 ml of DF salts minimal\nmedia without and with kanamycin, respectively. After approximately 24 h, 20 \u0006l\nof each culture was transferred to 5 ml of DF salts minimal medium supple-\nmented with tryptophan (200 \u0006g/ml) to induce 1AA production and incubated\nfor an additional 42 h. The turbidities of the cultures were measured spectro-\nphotometrically at 600 nm before the bacterial cells were separated from the\nculture medium by centrifugation. Each supernatant was immediately assayed to\ndetermine the 1AA concentration by Salkowski\u2019s assay as described above. Cells\nwere washed twice in 5 ml of sterile 0.03 M MgSO4, and the \ufb01nal suspension\nwas adjusted to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5 with 0.03 M MgSO4.\nCanola seeds (Hyola 401), kindly provided by J. Omielan (University of\nGuelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada), were prepared and inoculated by the meth-\nod outlined by Lifshitz et al. (28), with some modi\ufb01cations (7). Approximately\n300 seeds, previously stored in a desiccator at 4\u00b0C, were surface sterilized by\nsoaking them in 10 ml of 70% ethanol for 1 min and then in 10 ml of 1% sodium\nhypochlorite (bleach) for 10 min. To remove the residual bleach, the seeds were\nwashed \ufb01ve times with sterile distilled water. For each treatment, approximately\n100 seeds were transferred aseptically to sterile polystyrene petri dishes and\nincubated with 5 ml of either the wild-type or mutant bacterial suspension at\nroom temperature for 1 h to allow the bacteria to bind to the seed coat and for\nseed imbibition. Seeds were also incubated in 5 ml of 0.03 M MgSO4 under the\nsame conditions as a control.\nSix seeds were aseptically placed in each growth pouch (Mega 1nterna-\ntional, Mimeapolis, Mim.), which had been previously \ufb01lled with 10 ml of\ndistilled water and autoclaved. For each treatment, 10 pouches were pre-\npared. The pouches were placed upright in metal racks, with one treatment\nper rack to prevent cross-contamination, and there were two empty pouches\nat each end, of each rack. The racks were set in a plastic bin containing about\n3 cm of deionized water and covered loosely with plastic wrap to prevent\ndehydration. The pouches were incubated in a growth chamber at 20\u00b0C with\na daily cycle consisting of 12 h of darkness followed by 12 h of light (18 \u0006mol\nof photons/m2/s). For the \ufb01rst 2 days, the seeds were kept in the dark by\ncovering the pouches with aluminum foil. After 5 days, shoot and primary\nroot lengths were measured and analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (F\nvalues are indicated below). Seeds that had failed to germinate 3 days after\nthey were sown were marked, and shoots and roots that subsequently devel-\noped from these seeds were not measured.\nColonization assay. To determine if the 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida\nGR12-2 is impaired in the ability to colonize roots, canola seeds were inoculated\nwith either wild-type P. putida GR12-2 or the 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida\nGR12-2 or with a 1:1 mixture of the wild-type and mutant strains. Bacteria and\nseeds were prepared, inoculated, and incubated as described above for the root\nelongation assay. After 7 days, bacteria were extracted from six roots for each\ntreatment (two roots from each of three growth pouches) by brie\ufb02y rinsing the\nroots in sterile water and then suspending the roots in 1 ml of phosphate buffer\n(25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM Na2HPO4; pH 7.0) and shaking the preparations\nvigorously for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Dilutions were prepared in phosphate buffer and spread\nonto LB agar to determine total bacterial counts and onto LB agar containing\nkanamycin (50 \u0006g/ml) to determine mutant counts.\nRooting assay. The effects of wild-type P. putida GR12-2 and the 1AA-de\ufb01-\ncient mutant of P. putida GR12-2 on the development of adventitious roots\non mung bean cuttings were assessed by using the method outlined by Mayak\net al. (33). Mung bean (Vigna radiata) seeds were surface sterilized in a\nmamer similar to that used for canola seeds as described above. Seeds were\nimbibed for 1 h in sterile distilled water, sown in sterile vermiculite, and then\nincubated in a growth chamber as described above. After 7 days, the portions of\nthe seedlings above the surface of the vermiculite were excised with a razor blade\nand placed immediately in either water or a bacterial suspension prepared as\nfollows.\nFive milliliters of DF salts minimal medium was inoculated with the wild-\ntype or the 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida GR12-2 and incubated over-\nnight. Eighty microliters of each overnight culture was transferred to 20 ml of\nDF salts minimal medium containing tryptophan (200 \u0006g/ml) and incubated\nfor an additional 42 h. Cells were washed twice with sterile distilled water and\nresuspended in sterile water to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5.\nThree milliliters of each bacterial preparation was transferred to each of 10\nborosilicate glass tubes (10 by 75 mm), and 10 additional tubes were \ufb01lled\nwith 3 ml of sterile distilled water. One mung bean cutting was placed in each\ntube (a total of 10 cuttings per treatment), and the tubes were placed in a\nrack, covered loosely with plastic wrap to prevent evaporation, and incubated\nin the growth chamber under the conditions described above. After 8 days,\nthe cuttings were rinsed brie\ufb02y with distilled water, and the numbers and\nlengths of adventitious roots were measured by using a magnifying glass; the\ndata were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (F values are indicated\nbelow).\nNucleotide sequence accession number. The sequence of the P. putida GR12-2\nipdc gene reported in this paper has been deposited in the GenBank database\nunder accession number AF285632.\n3796\nPATTEN AND GLICK\nAPPL. ENVIRON. MICROBIOL.\n\nRESULTS 1solation of the ipdc gene. Hybridization of a P. putida\nGR12-2 genomic library (prepared by ligation of Sau3AI-di-\ngested fragments of total DNA with pUC19 and transforma-\ntion of E. coli DH5\u0003) with the indolepyruvate decarboxylase\n(ipdc) gene from E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 (24) revealed a\nsingle colony carrying 200 bp of the ipdc sequence. The se-\nquence was 98% identical at the nucleotide level to the 3\u0004 end\nof the E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 ipdc gene. The region down-\nstream of the ipdc gene contains a putative transcription ter-\nmination signal, identi\ufb01ed by the presence of sequences capa-\nble of forming a stable stem-loop structure in the mRNA and\na sequence 72% identical at the nucleotide level to an open\nreading frame in E. coli of unknown function (accession no.\nAE000327) on the opposite strand. Working on the assump-\ntion that the high degree of identity between the 3\u0004 ends of the\nP. putida GR12-2 and E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 ipdc se-\nquences could be extended to the entire gene, we designed\nPCR primers from the previously published E. cloacae FERM\nBP-1529 sequence to amplify the entire open reading frame.\nElectrophoresis of the PCR products obtained by using P.\nputida GR12-2 genomic DNA or cell lysates as templates re-\nvealed a single band of the expected size, about 1.7 kb. Se-\nquence analysis of the PCR products and alignment of the\nnucleotide sequence with the ipdc gene from E. cloacae FERM\nBP-1529 con\ufb01rmed that the P. putida GR12-2 ipdc gene had\nindeed been isolated. Furthermore, the translated amino acid\nsequence is similar to the amino acid sequences of other\nknown bacterial indolepyruvate decarboxylases (Fig. 1).\nThe P. putida GR12-2 indolepyruvate decarboxylase is also\nsimilar to pyruvate decarboxylases from Zymomonas mobilis\nand Saccharomyces cerevisiae, exhibiting substantial levels of\nidentity (33 and 36%, respectively) and similarity (51 and 53%,\nrespectively) in the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). Four of the\nsix residues believed to be involved in substrate binding and\ncatalysis of pyruvate decarboxylase are conserved in the in-\ndolepyruvate decarboxylase sequence; residues Asp29, His115,\nHis116, and Glu468 of indolepyruvate decarboxylase from P. pu-\ntida GR12-2 correspond to residues Asp27, His113, His114, and\nGlu473 in the active site of Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase\n(11) (Fig. 1). 1n addition, most of the residues known to bind\nthe cofactors Mg2\u0001 and thiamine diphosphate in pyruvate de-\ncarboxylase are conserved in indolepyruvate decarboxylase;\nthese residues include Glu52, Gly408, Asp435, Asn462, and\nGly464.\nConstruction of an 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant. Vector pJQ200\n(40) was used to deliver the ipdc sequence, disrupted by inser-\ntion of a gene for kanamycin resistance, into the genome of P.\nputida GR12-2. This plasmid has an origin of transfer (oriT)\nand mob genes from plasmid RP4, enabling transfer of the\nvector from E. coli S17.1 (45) into P. putida GR12-2 via con-\njugation. However, once in P. putida GR12-2, the vector can-\nnot replicate because it has an origin of replication derived\nfrom pACYC184 that is functional only in enterobacteria (40).\nThus, following transfer of the vector to P. putida GR12-2,\nkanamycin-resistant cells can arise only if the kanamycin resis-\ntance gene is inserted into the ipdc gene in the genome by\nhomologous recombination between the ipdc sequences on the\nplasmid and in the chromosome. 1n addition, because genta-\nmicin acetyltransferase and SacB are encoded on the vector,\nselection for the absence of these traits (that is, selection for\nsensitivity to gentamicin and resistance to the lethal effects of\nSacB in the presence of sucrose) selects against the incorpo-\nration of the entire plasmid into the genome that would result\nfrom a single crossover event.\nFollowing the transfer of pJQIPDC-Kan from E. coli S17.1\nto P. putida GR12-2 by conjugation, transconjugants were ini-\ntially selected on Simmons citrate agar (on which E. coli donor\ncells camot grow) containing kanamycin (on which nontrans-\nformed P. putida GR12-2 cells camot grow). Several colonies\nwere picked and subcultured on DF salts minimal agar (on\nwhich E. coli camot grow) containing kanamycin to con\ufb01rm\nthat they were indeed derived from P. putida GR12-2. Growth\non TSB agar containing kanamycin and 5% sucrose and the\nlack of growth on TSB agar containing gentamicin indicated\nthat the kanamycin resistance gene, but not the remainder of\nthe plasmid, had been inserted into the chromosome in all\nselected transconjugants. Replacement of the functional ipdc\ngene in the chromosome of P. putida GR12-2 with the\nipdc gene disrupted by the kanamycin resistance gene from\npJQIPDC-Kan was con\ufb01rmed by PCR by using primers de-\nsigned to amplify the ipdc gene and whole-cell lysates of\ntransconjugants and wild-type P. putida GR12-2 as templates.\nThe PCR products from transconjugants were 2.3 kb larger,\ncorresponding to the size of the kanamycin resistance gene\nfragment, than the PCR products from the wild-type strain\n(data not shown); the PCR products were con\ufb01rmed to contain\nthe ipdc sequence by Southern hybridization (data not shown). 1n addition, Southern hybridization con\ufb01rmed the presence of\na larger EcoRI fragment carrying the ipdc gene in the chro-\nmosome of the mutant strain than in the chromosome of the\nwild-type bacterium (data not shown).\nQuanti\ufb01cation of 1AA production. 1n the absence of trypto-\nphan supplements, both the 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant and wild-\ntype P. putida GR12-2 produced very low levels of 1AA (Table\n1). However, when both strains were grown in the presence of\n50 \u0006g of tryptophan per ml for approximately 42 h, wild-type\nP. putida GR12-2 responded by producing higher levels of 1AA, while the mutant was not capable of producing signi\ufb01cant\namounts of 1AA (Table 1). As the concentration of tryptophan\nin the growth medium was increased, 1AA production by the\nwild-type strain increased. 1n contrast, 1AA production by the\nmutant strain remained very low. Measurement of 1AA by\nHPLC con\ufb01rmed that in the presence of a high concentration\nof tryptophan (500 \u0006g/ml), the wild-type bacterium produced\nhigh levels of 1AA (68.3 \b 2.2 \u0006g/ml/OD600 unit), while 1AA\nwas not detected in the medium from mutant cells (\t1 \u0006g/ml/\nOD600 unit). The apparent slight increase in 1AA concentra-\ntion in the medium in mutant cultures containing 500 \u0006g of\ntryptophan per ml, as measured colorimetrically by reaction\nwith Salkowski\u2019s reagent (Table 1), may have been due to\naccumulation of indolepyruvic acid, which can also react with\nSalkowski\u2019s reagent, albeit to a much lesser extent than 1AA\n(data not shown). 1ndolepyruvic acid is the product of catalysis\nof tryptophan by tryptophan transaminase, the \ufb01rst step in the 1AA biosynthetic pathway, and is the substrate for indolepyru-\nvate decarboxylase, which is not functional in the mutant.\nGrowth of the mutant and wild-type P. putida GR12-2 was not\nVOL. 68, 2002\nROLE OF P.

Whereas the roots from seeds treated with wild-type\nP. putida GR12-2 were on average 35% longer than the roots\nfrom uninoculated control seeds after 5 days (P \t 0.01; F1/8 \n30.1), the lengths of roots from seeds treated with the 1AA-\nde\ufb01cient mutant were not different from the lengths of roots\nfrom uninoculated control seeds (P \t 0.01; F1/8 \n 4.3) (Table\n2). 1AA produced by the wild-type strain had no effect on shoot\nlength, as the lengths of shoots from seeds inoculated with\nwild-type P. putida GR12-2 were not different from the lengths\nof shoots from uninoculated seeds (F1/4 \n 5.1) (Table 2). Thus,\nas expected, eliminating 1AA production did not affect shoot\nlength (F1/4 \n 3.9).\nThe loss of the capacity to synthesize 1AA did not reduce the\nability of 1AA-de\ufb01cient P. putida GR12-2 to colonize canola\nseedling roots. The population size attained by the mutant\nbacterium on the surface of roots 7 days after seed inoculation\nwas similar to that attained by the wild-type strain when it was\ninoculated alone (Table 3). 1n addition, the relative population\nsizes were maintained on the roots when the seeds were coin-\noculated with equal amounts of the two strains (Table 3).\nRooting assay. Mung bean cuttings that were excised above\nthe roots after 7 days of growth in vermiculite and placed in\neither water or a bacterial suspension had visible roots at the\nbase of the stem after 5 days. After 8 days, the cuttings in water\nhad a few long roots (on average, about seven 3.4-mm-long\nroots growing just above the base) (Table 4). More than three\ntimes as many adventitious roots developed on cuttings placed\nin a suspension of wild-type P. putida GR12-2. Most of these\nroots were very small (less than 1 mm long) and were distrib-\nuted over several centimeters up from the base of the stem;\nsometimes there were a few longer roots right at the base.\nRoots that developed in the suspension of the 1AA-de\ufb01cient\nmutant of P. putida GR12-2 were both abundant and long; this\nis likely the best situation for propagation of cuttings in the\nlong term. Twice as many roots were present on these cuttings\nas on the cuttings growing in water, and the roots were gener-\nally longer than those that developed in the wild-type bacterial\nsuspension (Table 4).\nDISCUSSION\nThe amino acid sequence determined from the ipdc gene\nisolated from P. putida GR12-2 reveals a 552-amino-acid pro-\ntein with a predicted molecular weight of approximately\n60,000. This protein is not transcribed from an operon con-\ntaining the other genes involved in the biosynthesis of 1AA by\nthe indolepyruvic acid pathway as it is transcribed from its own\npromoter (unpublished data) and has a transcription termina-\ntion sequence just downstream of the translation stop codon. 1t\nis reasonable to conclude that the enzymes involved in the\nindolepyruvic acid pathway are not expressed from an operon\nbecause multiple copies of the gene encoding the \ufb01rst enzyme\nin the pathway, an aromatic aminotransferase, are often pres-\nent in a single bacterium, and the enzyme prefers amino acid\nsubstrates other than tryptophan (22, 23, 46). Thus, this aro-\nmatic aminotransferase is not solely an 1AA biosynthesis en-\nzyme.\nThe sequence of indolepyruvate decarboxylase from P. pu-\ntida GR12-2 is similar to the sequence of indolepyruvate de-\ncarboxylase from E. cloacae FERM BP-1529 (99% identity),\nwhich was isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumber (24), and\nto the sequence of the same protein from Erwinia herbicola\n299R (57% identity and 71% similarity), an epiphytic bacte-\nrium isolated from pear (5). The sequences of the indolepyru-\nvate decarboxylases from two Azospirillum brasilense strains,\nSp245 and Sp7 (10, 50), are somewhat different from the se-\nquences of these enzymes from the bacteria mentioned above,\nTABLE 3.

PUTIDA 1AA 1N ROOT DEVELOPMENT\n3799\n\nincluding P. putida GR12-2 (29% identity and 44% similarity),\nalthough identi\ufb01ed conserved regions are present.\nTo understand how microbial 1AA in\ufb02uences plant growth,\nmutants with signi\ufb01cantly reduced levels of 1AA have been\ngenerated for the phytopathogens P. syringae (9, 34), A. tume-\nfaciens (29), and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (8) and for the\nplant growth-promoting bacterium Azosprillum lipoferum (1). 1nsertional mutagenesis of the ipdc gene was used here to\nsuccessfully generate a mutant of P. putida GR12-2 that is\nde\ufb01cient in 1AA production even in the presence of trypto-\nphan, conditions under which the wild-type strain produces\ncopious amounts of 1AA.\nThe loss of the ability to produce 1AA following disruption\nof the ipdc gene con\ufb01rms that P. putida GR12-2 produces 1AA\nvia the indolepyruvic acid pathway. This provides more support\nfor the hypothesis (36) that plant growth-promoting bacteria,\nsuch as Azospirillum spp. (10) and E. cloacae (24), produce 1AA via the indolepyruvic acid pathway, in contrast to plant\npathogens, which seem to preferentially synthesize 1AA via the\nindoleacetamide pathway (25, 48). 1ndeed, rendering the ipdc\ngene inactive by insertional mutagenesis and thereby eliminat-\ning 1AA production by this pathway signi\ufb01cantly reduces the\nability of P. putida GR12-2 to promote primary root growth in\ncanola seedlings. 1t is known from application of exogenous 1AA (13, 47) or application of diluted culture extracts or low-\ndensity inocula of bacteria that produce high levels of 1AA (20,\n43) that low concentrations of 1AA can stimulate primary root\nelongation; here we demonstrate directly that bacterial 1AA\nplays a major role in promotion of root elongation when a\nbacterium is associated with its host plant. 1AA secreted by a bacterium may promote root growth\ndirectly by stimulating plant cell elongation or cell division or\nindirectly by in\ufb02uencing bacterial ACC deaminase activity.\nACC deaminase, produced by many plant growth-promoting\nbacteria (16, 44), including P. putida GR12-2 (21), is involved\nin the stimulation of root elongation in seedlings (27). ACC\ndeaminase hydrolyzes plant ACC, the immediate precursor of\nthe phytohormone ethylene, and thereby prevents the produc-\ntion of plant growth-inhibiting levels of ethylene (38). Mutants\nof plant growth-promoting bacteria that do not produce ACC\ndeaminase have lost the ability to stimulate root elongation\n(27). 1t is possible that 1AA and ACC deaminase work in\nconcert to stimulate root elongation. Exogenous 1AA is known\nto increase transcription and activity of ACC synthase (37),\nwhich catalyzes the production of ACC in plants. ACC stimu-\nlates ACC deaminase activity in bacteria (21, 26).\nThe reduced ability of 1AA-de\ufb01cient P. putida GR12-2 to\npromote canola root growth camot be attributed to defective\ncolonization. Although Brandl and Lindow (6) showed that an 1AA mutant of E. herbicola 299R was less competitive than the\nwild-type strain for colonization of bean leaves and pear \ufb02ow-\ners, the P. putida GR12-2 1AA mutant was able to colonize\ncanola roots to the same extent as the wild-type strain follow-\ning seed inoculation.\nWhile low levels of 1AA stimulate root elongation, high\nlevels of bacterial 1AA, whether from 1AA-overproducing mu-\ntants or strains that naturally secrete high levels or from high-\ndensity inocula, stimulate the formation of lateral and adven-\ntitious roots (3, 4, 30, 33, 42, 49). P. putida GR12-2 cells that\nproduce wild-type levels of 1AA stimulated the formation of\nmany short adventitious roots on mung bean cuttings, and an 1AA-overproducing mutant stimulated the formation of even\nmore adventitious roots than the wild-type strain (33). 1n con-\ntrast, the 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida GR12-2 stimulated\nthe formation of fewer roots than the wild-type bacterium, and\nthe roots were generally longer than those induced by the\nwild-type strain. 1nitiation of adventitious and lateral roots may be mediated\nby 1AA-induced ethylene. An ACC deaminase-negative mu-\ntant of P. putida GR12-2 which camot reduce ethylene levels\nin plants stimulated the formation of more small adventitious\nroots than the wild-type strain (33). The increase in the num-\nber of roots on the cuttings correlated with an increase in\nethylene production. The 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant of P. putida\nGR12-2 may not stimulate the formation of ACC synthase and\ntherefore ethylene synthesis in plants; thus, fewer adventitious\nroots were initiated on the cuttings.\nHigh levels of exogenous or bacterial 1AA, and therefore\nhigh levels of ethylene, have also been shown to inhibit elon-\ngation growth in roots (4, 30, 41, 42, 49). Thus, while adventi-\ntious roots that formed on mung bean cuttings inoculated with\nwild-type P. putida GR12-2 were very short (most were less\nthan 1 mm long), the roots whose formation was stimulated by\nthe 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant strain were longer. The cuttings were\nexposed to a high inoculum density continuously for an ex-\ntended period of time; therefore, cuttings treated with the\nwild-type bacterium were exposed to a high level of 1AA.\nFrom a practical point of view, treatment of cuttings with an 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant may be a bene\ufb01cial method for propa-\ngation of plants. Certainly, while many adventitious roots are\ndesirable, longer roots with more surface area through which\nthe plants can absorb nutrients and water from the soil would\nbe advantageous. Treatment with the 1AA-de\ufb01cient mutant of\nP. putida GR12-2 provides just such a compromise between the\nmany short roots whose formation is stimulated by the wild-\ntype strain and the few long roots produced by treatment with\nwater.\nProduction of 1AA, a plant hormone that does not appar-\nently function as a hormone in bacterial cells, may have\nevolved in bacteria because it is important in the bacterium-\nplant relationship. 1n this research we showed that bacterial 1AA stimulates the development of the host plant root system.\nThe advantage for root-associated bacteria is a rich supply of\nnutrients, as much of the metabolic products of the carbon\n\ufb01xed by plants is lost from roots and moves into the rhizo-\nsphere as exudates, lysates, and mucilage (32).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Alberto Mendoza Herrera, Centro de Biotecnolog\u0131\n\u00b4a Ge-\nno\n\u00b4mica, Reynosa, Tampico, Mexico, for HPLC measurements of 1AA.\nThis work was supported by grants to B.R.G. and by a scholarship to\nC.L.P. from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council\nof Canada and by an Ontario Graduate Scholarship in Science and\nTechnology to C.L.P.\nREFERENCES\n1.

The patient received \ufb01eld care, including metro-\nnidazole and cefazolin. Subsequent deep-wound cultures grew Serratia fonticola, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas\nhydrophila, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus durans but no anaerobes.\nCASE REPORT\nA 49-year-old hunter was attacked by a grizzly bear while\nhunting elk in the foothills of the Canadian Rocky Mountains.\nThis attack took place in the foothills area outside of and east\nof Banff National Park, Alberta, within the known grizzly bear\nrange, which is a narrow strip of 60 km between the continental\ndivide and the prairies. He suffered multiple injuries to his\nscalp and shoulders. 1n particular, he remembered the bear\nbiting him on the skull. He was able to kill the bear with his\ngun. He was taken to a local hospital where he received one\ndose of cefazolin plus metronidazole and a tetanus toxoid\ninjection. The patient was then transferred to a tertiary care\nhospital where he received 1 g of cefazolin immediately prior\nto surgical debridement and closure of multiple lacerations.\nTeeth marks were noted on the cranium. Cultures were taken\nfrom the scalp lacerations at the time of surgery, about 12 h\nafter the injuries occurred.\nLaboratory data showed 14.1 g of hemoglobin/liter, 10.5 \u0002\n109 white blood cells/liter, and 9.1 \u0002 109 neutrophil cells/liter.\nThe erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 25 mm/h. C-reactive\nprotein elevated at 109 mg/dl. Cultures eventually grew strains\nof Serratia fonticola, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas hydrophila,\nBacillus cereus, and Enterococcus durans. The gram-negative\nbacteria were all susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cipro-\n\ufb02oxacin, gentamicin, and trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole but\nresistant to ampicillin, cefazolin, and cefuroxime. The entero-\ncoccus was ampicillin and vancomycin susceptible. No anaer-\nobes were isolated even though an anaerobic culture was ob-\ntained.\nPostoperatively, the patient was started on 4.5 g of pipera-\ncillin-tazobactam intravenously every 8 h. Since the attack was\nunprovoked, the patient was given rabies vaccine and rabies\nimmunoglobulin. The bear\u2019s brain was later examined for ra-\nbies virus and was found to be negative; consequently, subse-\nquent doses of rabies vaccine were discontinued. The patient\nreceived 1 week of therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam and\nwas subsequently given 875 mg of amoxicillin-clavulanate\norally twice a day and 500 mg of cipro\ufb02oxacin orally twice a day\nfor three additional weeks. There was a good clinical response.\nAs more North Americans enter wilderness areas for recre-\nation and to build homes, the habitats of humans and wild\nanimals begin to merge, and their interactions increase. Bear\npopulations have increased, and bear and human encounters,\nincluding maulings and bites, have also become more common\n(1, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13). 1t is estimated that there are approximately 1,000 grizzly\nbears and 39,000 black bears in Alberta (7). Black bears are the\nsmallest of North American bears and weigh approximately\n200 pounds and stand 5 feet tall. Grizzly bears weigh more than\n350 pounds and stand 6 1/2 feet tall. Bears feed voraciously in\nthe summer months on an omnivorous diet that consists of\n90% plants (grass, horsetail shoots, bulbs, wild lilies, wild on-\nions, cow parsnips, and huckleberries) and 10% animal matter\n(ground squirrels, insects including ants and beetles, and oc-\ncasional deer and winter elk) (8, 10). 1n Alberta, from 1960 to\n1998, 42 documented serious or fatal injuries were caused by\nbears with most (69%) caused by grizzly bears, even though\nthey make up only 2.5% of the total bear population in Alberta\n(7). Only an estimated 17% of the 1,000 Alberta grizzly bears\nare located in the national parks in Alberta, but 72% of grizzly\nattacks occur in the national parks. 1t is thought that this is\nmostly due to the large number of people entering into the\ngrizzly bear habitat. For example, Banff National Park, which is\nlocated on the western edge of the province of Alberta along\nthe eastern side of the Canadian Rocky Mountains, has over\n4.5 million visitors a year and only an estimated 60 to 80 grizzly\nbears. Ten of the 42 serious or fatal injuries caused by bears in\nAlberta from 1960 to 1998 occurred in Banff. Similarly, Glacier\nNational Park is located in northern Montana near the Cana-\ndian (Alberta)-U.S. border and has an average of 2.1 million\nvisitors annually. 1t was estimated in 1987 that approximately\n500 black bears and 200 grizzly bears live in Glacier National\nPark (8). 1n the last 5 years at Glacier National Park, there has\nbeen one fatality and an additional 13 people injured in 10\nencounters (Gary Moses, personal communication). There is\nno estimate as to the number of bear sightings. The 1nter-\nagency Grizzly Bear Committee has a website which includes\n* Corresponding author. Mailing address: R. M.

They suggest that\nwhen in bear country, make noise to make your presence\nknown. 1f a black bear approaches, try to scare it away by\nshouting, making noise, or throwing small stones. 1f a black\nbear attacks, \ufb01ght back, whereas if a grizzly bear attacks, play\ndead; either curl up in a ball or lie face down, using your hands\nand arms to protect the back of your neck and face. 1t has been reported (12) that the risk of infection following\nbear bite is \u201cconsiderable,\u201d with 4 out of 9 (44%) survivors\ndeveloping clinical infection. Most surviving bear bite victims\nreceive a variety of therapies in the \ufb01eld, including cleansing of\nthe wounds and early antimicrobial administration prior to\nhospitalization. However, the bacteriology of these wounds is\nlimited by the absence of systematic study and the paucity of\npatients cultured, and cultures are not usually taken prior to,\nor even after the initiation of, antimicrobial therapy (12). Con-\nsequently, there are scant data regarding the bacteriology of\nbear bite wounds (12) or regarding the oral \ufb02ora of wild bears\n(3, 11), and conclusions about the most appropriate antimicro-\nbial therapy are moot.\nPrior studies with dog and cat bites have shown that it is the\noral \ufb02ora of the biting animal that is usually isolated from bite\nwound infections and form the basis of empirical antimicrobial\ntherapy (4). Goatcher et al. (3) reported a study of nasal,\nrectal, and preputial or vaginal swab cultures in black and\ngrizzly bears in northwestern Alberta, Canada, and suggested\nthat \u201cthe predominant micro\ufb02ora of both grizzly and black\nbears were transient and probably in\ufb02uenced by their foraging\nhabits and surrounding environments.\u201d They did not specify\nwhich bacteria were isolated from individual sites.\nParry et al. (11) took mouth cultures of 31 brown and grizzly\nbears in several Alaska locales and reported general groupings\nof isolates with scant speci\ufb01c bacteriological identi\ufb01cations.\nThey found that 21 oral samples from bears had mixed gram-\npositive and gram-negative \ufb02ora. Nine had only gram-negative\nbacteria isolated and one had only gram-positive \ufb02ora. Staph-\nylococcus epidermidis was present in 14 out of 31 (45%), strep-\ntococci were present in 13 out of 31 (42%), Escherichia coli was\npresent in 8 out of 20 (40%), diphtheroids were present in 18\nout of 31 (58%), unidenti\ufb01able gram-negative rods were\npresent in 8 out of 31 (26%), and pseudomonads were present\nin 3 out of 31 (10%) samples (Table 1) (5).\nRose (12) reported 10 cases of bear maulings, with the\nbacteriology of three of the cases noted (Table 2). One pa-\ntient\u2019s wound-associated cellulitis grew Staphylococcus aureus,\none patient\u2019s wound grew scant S. epidermidis, and one patient\nwith a fever had a wound that grew Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter\ndiversus, E. coli, and S. epidermidis. 1t was unclear if these\nwounds were the result of claw or bite injuries or both. The\ninvestigator was unable to recommend speci\ufb01c prophylactic\nantimicrobial therapy. Cardall and Rosen (2) reported a case\nof a grizzly bear attack near Jackson, Wyoming, where the\nwound was copiously irrigated and the patient was given em-\npirical tetanus toxoid and cefazolin preoperatively. No cultures\nwere reported, and the patient did not develop a postoperative\ninfection.\nOur patient showed aerobic gram-negative bacilli and en-\nterococcus but no anaerobes. This may be due to the single\ndose of metronidazole or lack of anaerobic infection. 1t seems\nfrom the review of available data that patients who are victims\nof bear maulings and bites should be treated with a broad-\nspectrum agent with activity against S. aureus and aerobic\ngram-negative rods as was done in this case. The absence of\nanaerobic bacteria in any of the previously reported cultured\nwounds may be due to the lack of anaerobic cultures obtained\nfrom patients, prolonged transport of samples without ade-\nquate anaerobic transport conditions, use of suboptimal anaer-\nobic culture media or methods, or early suppressive antimicro-\nbial therapy. 1t seems likely that anaerobes should be present\nin the normal oral \ufb02ora of bears, as they are prevalent in the\noral \ufb02ora of humans, dogs, and cats and are important patho-\ngens in those bite wounds. Consequently, it seems prudent to\nadminister broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that also pos-\nsess anaerobic coverage.\nWe thank the staff of the Medical Microbiology Laboratory, Uni-\nversity of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta, for identi\ufb01cation of\nthe organisms.No \ufb01nancial support was obtained from any entity.\nTABLE 1.

The patient received \ufb01eld care, including metro-\nnidazole and cefazolin. Subsequent deep-wound cultures grew Serratia fonticola, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas\nhydrophila, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus durans but no anaerobes.\nCASE REPORT\nA 49-year-old hunter was attacked by a grizzly bear while\nhunting elk in the foothills of the Canadian Rocky Mountains.\nThis attack took place in the foothills area outside of and east\nof Banff National Park, Alberta, within the known grizzly bear\nrange, which is a narrow strip of 60 km between the continental\ndivide and the prairies. He suffered multiple injuries to his\nscalp and shoulders. In particular, he remembered the bear\nbiting him on the skull. He was able to kill the bear with his\ngun. He was taken to a local hospital where he received one\ndose of cefazolin plus metronidazole and a tetanus toxoid\ninjection. The patient was then transferred to a tertiary care\nhospital where he received 1 g of cefazolin immediately prior\nto surgical debridement and closure of multiple lacerations.\nTeeth marks were noted on the cranium. Cultures were taken\nfrom the scalp lacerations at the time of surgery, about 12 h\nafter the injuries occurred.\nLaboratory data showed 14.1 g of hemoglobin/liter, 10.5 \u0002\n109 white blood cells/liter, and 9.1 \u0002 109 neutrophil cells/liter.\nThe erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 25 mm/h. C-reactive\nprotein elevated at 109 mg/dl. Cultures eventually grew strains\nof Serratia fonticola, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas hydrophila,\nBacillus cereus, and Enterococcus durans. The gram-negative\nbacteria were all susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cipro-\n\ufb02oxacin, gentamicin, and trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole but\nresistant to ampicillin, cefazolin, and cefuroxime. The entero-\ncoccus was ampicillin and vancomycin susceptible. No anaer-\nobes were isolated even though an anaerobic culture was ob-\ntained.\nPostoperatively, the patient was started on 4.5 g of pipera-\ncillin-tazobactam intravenously every 8 h. Since the attack was\nunprovoked, the patient was given rabies vaccine and rabies\nimmunoglobulin. The bear\u2019s brain was later examined for ra-\nbies virus and was found to be negative; consequently, subse-\nquent doses of rabies vaccine were discontinued. The patient\nreceived 1 week of therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam and\nwas subsequently given 875 mg of amoxicillin-clavulanate\norally twice a day and 500 mg of cipro\ufb02oxacin orally twice a day\nfor three additional weeks. There was a good clinical response.\nAs more North Americans enter wilderness areas for recre-\nation and to build homes, the habitats of humans and wild\nanimals begin to merge, and their interactions increase. Bear\npopulations have increased, and bear and human encounters,\nincluding maulings and bites, have also become more common\n(1, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13).\nIt is estimated that there are approximately 1,000 grizzly\nbears and 39,000 black bears in Alberta (7). Black bears are the\nsmallest of North American bears and weigh approximately\n200 pounds and stand 5 feet tall. Grizzly bears weigh more than\n350 pounds and stand 6 1/2 feet tall. Bears feed voraciously in\nthe summer months on an omnivorous diet that consists of\n90% plants (grass, horsetail shoots, bulbs, wild lilies, wild on-\nions, cow parsnips, and huckleberries) and 10% animal matter\n(ground squirrels, insects including ants and beetles, and oc-\ncasional deer and winter elk) (8, 10). In Alberta, from 1960 to\n1998, 42 documented serious or fatal injuries were caused by\nbears with most (69%) caused by grizzly bears, even though\nthey make up only 2.5% of the total bear population in Alberta\n(7). Only an estimated 17% of the 1,000 Alberta grizzly bears\nare located in the national parks in Alberta, but 72% of grizzly\nattacks occur in the national parks. It is thought that this is\nmostly due to the large number of people entering into the\ngrizzly bear habitat. For example, Banff National Park, which is\nlocated on the western edge of the province of Alberta along\nthe eastern side of the Canadian Rocky Mountains, has over\n4.5 million visitors a year and only an estimated 60 to 80 grizzly\nbears. Ten of the 42 serious or fatal injuries caused by bears in\nAlberta from 1960 to 1998 occurred in Banff. Similarly, Glacier\nNational Park is located in northern Montana near the Cana-\ndian (Alberta)-U.S. border and has an average of 2.1 million\nvisitors annually. It was estimated in 1987 that approximately\n500 black bears and 200 grizzly bears live in Glacier National\nPark (8). In the last 5 years at Glacier National Park, there has\nbeen one fatality and an additional 13 people injured in 10\nencounters (Gary Moses, personal communication). There is\nno estimate as to the number of bear sightings. The Inter-\nagency Grizzly Bear Committee has a website which includes\n* Corresponding author. Mailing address: R. M.

They suggest that\nwhen in bear country, make noise to make your presence\nknown. If a black bear approaches, try to scare it away by\nshouting, making noise, or throwing small stones. If a black\nbear attacks, \ufb01ght back, whereas if a grizzly bear attacks, play\ndead; either curl up in a ball or lie face down, using your hands\nand arms to protect the back of your neck and face.\nIt has been reported (12) that the risk of infection following\nbear bite is \u201cconsiderable,\u201d with 4 out of 9 (44%) survivors\ndeveloping clinical infection. Most surviving bear bite victims\nreceive a variety of therapies in the \ufb01eld, including cleansing of\nthe wounds and early antimicrobial administration prior to\nhospitalization. However, the bacteriology of these wounds is\nlimited by the absence of systematic study and the paucity of\npatients cultured, and cultures are not usually taken prior to,\nor even after the initiation of, antimicrobial therapy (12). Con-\nsequently, there are scant data regarding the bacteriology of\nbear bite wounds (12) or regarding the oral \ufb02ora of wild bears\n(3, 11), and conclusions about the most appropriate antimicro-\nbial therapy are moot.\nPrior studies with dog and cat bites have shown that it is the\noral \ufb02ora of the biting animal that is usually isolated from bite\nwound infections and form the basis of empirical antimicrobial\ntherapy (4). Goatcher et al. (3) reported a study of nasal,\nrectal, and preputial or vaginal swab cultures in black and\ngrizzly bears in northwestern Alberta, Canada, and suggested\nthat \u201cthe predominant micro\ufb02ora of both grizzly and black\nbears were transient and probably in\ufb02uenced by their foraging\nhabits and surrounding environments.\u201d They did not specify\nwhich bacteria were isolated from individual sites.\nParry et al. (11) took mouth cultures of 31 brown and grizzly\nbears in several Alaska locales and reported general groupings\nof isolates with scant speci\ufb01c bacteriological identi\ufb01cations.\nThey found that 21 oral samples from bears had mixed gram-\npositive and gram-negative \ufb02ora. Nine had only gram-negative\nbacteria isolated and one had only gram-positive \ufb02ora. Staph-\nylococcus epidermidis was present in 14 out of 31 (45%), strep-\ntococci were present in 13 out of 31 (42%), Escherichia coli was\npresent in 8 out of 20 (40%), diphtheroids were present in 18\nout of 31 (58%), unidenti\ufb01able gram-negative rods were\npresent in 8 out of 31 (26%), and pseudomonads were present\nin 3 out of 31 (10%) samples (Table 1) (5).\nRose (12) reported 10 cases of bear maulings, with the\nbacteriology of three of the cases noted (Table 2). One pa-\ntient\u2019s wound-associated cellulitis grew Staphylococcus aureus,\none patient\u2019s wound grew scant S. epidermidis, and one patient\nwith a fever had a wound that grew Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter\ndiversus, E. coli, and S. epidermidis. It was unclear if these\nwounds were the result of claw or bite injuries or both. The\ninvestigator was unable to recommend speci\ufb01c prophylactic\nantimicrobial therapy. Cardall and Rosen (2) reported a case\nof a grizzly bear attack near Jackson, Wyoming, where the\nwound was copiously irrigated and the patient was given em-\npirical tetanus toxoid and cefazolin preoperatively. No cultures\nwere reported, and the patient did not develop a postoperative\ninfection.\nOur patient showed aerobic gram-negative bacilli and en-\nterococcus but no anaerobes. This may be due to the single\ndose of metronidazole or lack of anaerobic infection. It seems\nfrom the review of available data that patients who are victims\nof bear maulings and bites should be treated with a broad-\nspectrum agent with activity against S. aureus and aerobic\ngram-negative rods as was done in this case. The absence of\nanaerobic bacteria in any of the previously reported cultured\nwounds may be due to the lack of anaerobic cultures obtained\nfrom patients, prolonged transport of samples without ade-\nquate anaerobic transport conditions, use of suboptimal anaer-\nobic culture media or methods, or early suppressive antimicro-\nbial therapy. It seems likely that anaerobes should be present\nin the normal oral \ufb02ora of bears, as they are prevalent in the\noral \ufb02ora of humans, dogs, and cats and are important patho-\ngens in those bite wounds. Consequently, it seems prudent to\nadminister broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that also pos-\nsess anaerobic coverage.\nWe thank the staff of the Medical Microbiology Laboratory, Uni-\nversity of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta, for identi\ufb01cation of\nthe organisms.No \ufb01nancial support was obtained from any entity.\nTABLE 1.

They suggest that\nwhen in bear country, make noise to make your presence\nknown. 1f a black bear approaches, try to scare it away by\nshouting, making noise, or throwing small stones. 1f a black\nbear attacks, \ufb01ght back, whereas if a grizzly bear attacks, play\ndead; either curl up in a ball or lie face down, using your hands\nand arms to protect the back of your neck and face. 1t has been reported (12) that the risk of infection following\nbear bite is \u201cconsiderable,\u201d with 4 out of 9 (44%) survivors\ndeveloping clinical infection. Most surviving bear bite victims\nreceive a variety of therapies in the \ufb01eld, including cleansing of\nthe wounds and early antimicrobial administration prior to\nhospitalization. However, the bacteriology of these wounds is\nlimited by the absence of systematic study and the paucity of\npatients cultured, and cultures are not usually taken prior to,\nor even after the initiation of, antimicrobial therapy (12). Con-\nsequently, there are scant data regarding the bacteriology of\nbear bite wounds (12) or regarding the oral \ufb02ora of wild bears\n(3, 11), and conclusions about the most appropriate antimicro-\nbial therapy are moot.\nPrior studies with dog and cat bites have shown that it is the\noral \ufb02ora of the biting animal that is usually isolated from bite\nwound infections and form the basis of empirical antimicrobial\ntherapy (4). Goatcher et al. (3) reported a study of nasal,\nrectal, and preputial or vaginal swab cultures in black and\ngrizzly bears in northwestern Alberta, Canada, and suggested\nthat \u201cthe predominant micro\ufb02ora of both grizzly and black\nbears were transient and probably in\ufb02uenced by their foraging\nhabits and surrounding environments.\u201d They did not specify\nwhich bacteria were isolated from individual sites.\nParry et al. (11) took mouth cultures of 31 brown and grizzly\nbears in several Alaska locales and reported general groupings\nof isolates with scant speci\ufb01c bacteriological identi\ufb01cations.\nThey found that 21 oral samples from bears had mixed gram-\npositive and gram-negative \ufb02ora. Nine had only gram-negative\nbacteria isolated and one had only gram-positive \ufb02ora. Staph-\nylococcus epidermidis was present in 14 out of 31 (45%), strep-\ntococci were present in 13 out of 31 (42%), Escherichia coli was\npresent in 8 out of 20 (40%), diphtheroids were present in 18\nout of 31 (58%), unidenti\ufb01able gram-negative rods were\npresent in 8 out of 31 (26%), and pseudomonads were present\nin 3 out of 31 (10%) samples (Table 1) (5).\nRose (12) reported 10 cases of bear maulings, with the\nbacteriology of three of the cases noted (Table 2). One pa-\ntient\u2019s wound-associated cellulitis grew Staphylococcus aureus,\none patient\u2019s wound grew scant S. epidermidis, and one patient\nwith a fever had a wound that grew Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter\ndiversus, E. coli, and S. epidermidis. 1t was unclear if these\nwounds were the result of claw or bite injuries or both. The\ninvestigator was unable to recommend speci\ufb01c prophylactic\nantimicrobial therapy. Cardall and Rosen (2) reported a case\nof a grizzly bear attack near Jackson, Wyoming, where the\nwound was copiously irrigated and the patient was given em-\npirical tetanus toxoid and cefazolin preoperatively. No cultures\nwere reported, and the patient did not develop a postoperative\ninfection.\nOur patient showed aerobic gram-negative bacilli and en-\nterococcus but no anaerobes. This may be due to the single\ndose of metronidazole or lack of anaerobic infection. 1t seems\nfrom the review of available data that patients who are victims\nof bear maulings and bites should be treated with a broad-\nspectrum agent with activity against S. aureus and aerobic\ngram-negative rods as was done in this case. The absence of\nanaerobic bacteria in any of the previously reported cultured\nwounds may be due to the lack of anaerobic cultures obtained\nfrom patients, prolonged transport of samples without ade-\nquate anaerobic transport conditions, use of suboptimal anaer-\nobic culture media or methods, or early suppressive antimicro-\nbial therapy. 1t seems likely that anaerobes should be present\nin the normal oral \ufb02ora of bears, as they are prevalent in the\noral \ufb02ora of humans, dogs, and cats and are important patho-\ngens in those bite wounds. Consequently, it seems prudent to\nadminister broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that also pos-\nsess anaerobic coverage.\nWe thank the staff of the Medical Microbiology Laboratory, Uni-\nversity of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta, for identi\ufb01cation of\nthe organisms.No \ufb01nancial support was obtained from any entity.\nTABLE 1.

Here we show that in several cell lines infected with a\nrecombinant EBV strain encoding green \ufb02uorescent protein (GFP), the virus lytic cycle coincides with GFP\nexpression, which thus can be used as a marker of virus replication. EBV replication resulted in downregu-\nlation of MHC class 1I and all classical MHC class 1 alleles independently of viral DNA synthesis or late gene\nexpression. Although assembled MHC class 1 complexes, the total pool of heavy chains, and \u00012-microglobulin\n(\u00012m) were signi\ufb01cantly downregulated, free class 1 heavy chains were stabilized at the surface of cells\nreplicating EBV. Calnexin expression was increased in GFP\u0002 cells, and calnexin and calreticulin accumulated\nat the cell surface that could contribute to the stabilization of class 1 heavy chains. Decreased expression levels\nof another chaperone, ERp57, and TAP2, a transporter associated with antigen processing and presentation,\ncorrelated with delayed kinetics of MHC class 1 maturation. Levels of both class 1 heavy chain and \u00012m mRNA\nwere reduced, and metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated a very low rate of class 1 heavy chain synthesis\nin lytically infected cells. MHC class 1 and MHC class 1I downregulation was mimicked by pharmacological\ninhibition of protein synthesis in latently infected cells. Our data suggest that although several mechanisms\nmay contribute to MHC class 1 downregulation in the course of EBV replication, inhibition of MHC class 1\nsynthesis plays the primary role in the process.\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human gammaherpesvirus,\nwhich causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with a\nnumber of malignancies arising from B cells, epithelial cells,\nand other cell lineages. EBV establishes latent infection pre-\ndominantly, if not exclusively, in B lymphocytes, but virus rep-\nlication can occur in both B lymphocytes and epithelial cells of\nthe oropharynx. 1n the course of virus replication, approxi-\nmately 70 lytic cycle proteins are expressed in EBV-infected\ncells in three temporal stages: immediate early (IE), early, and\nlate. Entry into the lytic cycle is triggered by expression of\neither of the two 1E genes BZLF1 and BRLF1. Both the\nBZLF1 and BRLF1 proteins function as transcriptional acti-\nvators and initiate the ordered cascade of viral lytic gene\nexpression culminating in the release of infectious virus (re-\nviewed in reference 18).\nThe majority of EBV carriers mount strong cytotoxic T-\nlymphocyte (CTL) responses speci\ufb01c to EBV lytic cycle anti-\ngens (5, 6, 15). EBV-speci\ufb01c CTLs appear to play the most\nimportant role in the immunological control of EBV replica-\ntion and EBV-induced malignant transformation. CTLs recog-\nnize their target cells through major histocompatibility com-\nplex (MHC) class 1 molecules loaded with antigen-derived\npeptides. Peptide ligands are generated in the cytosol by the\nproteolytic action of the proteasome and trimming peptidases\nand then translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by\nheterodimeric transporters associated with antigen presenta-\ntion 1 and 2 (TAP1 and TAP2). 1n the ER, MHC class 1 heavy\nchains interact with the chaperone calnexin, followed by inter-\naction with the chaperones calreticulin, ERp57, and \u00022-micro-\nglobulin (\u00022m) and a preformed complex of TAPs and tapasin.\nThis peptide loading complex is essential for ef\ufb01cient assembly\nof MHC class 1 complexes and their egress from the ER\nthrough the Golgi to the cell surface (reviewed in reference 8).\nTo escape from CD8\u0001 T-cell recognition and destruction, vi-\nruses have developed strategies to inhibit the expression of MHC\nclass 1. These mechanisms include transcriptional downregulation\nof the heavy chain expression, interference with antigen process-\ning by the proteasome, blocking of peptide transport into the ER,\ndislocation of MHC class 1 heavy chains from the ER to the\ncytosol for subsequent degradation, retention of MHC class 1 in\nthe ER, and targeted degradation of class 1 from post-ER com-\npartments. Several of these strategies for herpes simplex virus,\nvaricella-zoster virus, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus,\nand most notably cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been dissected\nin detail previously (reviewed in references 19 and 36).\nEBV replication also results in downregulation of MHC\nclass 1 molecules at the surface of infected cells.

Previous\nstudies have shown that in lymphoblastoid cell lines, the EBV\nlytic cycle and MHC class 1 downregulation are paralleled by\ndownregulation of MHC class 1I, CD40, and CD54 while\nCD19, CD80, and CD86 are not affected, pointing to a possible\nspeci\ufb01city of the process (16). Reduction of MHC class 1 ex-\npression was found to be an early lytic cycle event that was not\ndependent on viral DNA replication. The immediate-early\nBZLF1 protein was implicated in MHC class 1 downregulation\nin lymphoblastoid cell lines through inhibition of latent mem-\nbrane protein 1 (LMP1), which upregulates MHC class 1 ex-\npression in cells latently infected by EBV and is also expressed\nthroughout the lytic cycle. A more ef\ufb01cient system has been\ndeveloped recently to study EBV replication based on trans-\nfection of EBV-positive Akata cells with a reporter which is\nexpressed during the lytic cycle, allowing identi\ufb01cation and\nisolation of cells supporting virus replication from those in\nlatency (29). Experiments performed with this model revealed\nthat the capacity of the TAP1/TAP2 heterodimer to translo-\ncate peptides into the ER is inhibited by up to 70% during\nEBV replication, and because the expression of MHC class 1\nheavy chains was found to be unaltered, it was suggested that\nthis mechanism plays the primary role in downregulation of\nMHC class 1 molecules in the course of EBV replication (29). 1n this study, we made use of a similar model based on a\nrecombinant Akata virus carrying a cassette expressing green\n\ufb02uorescent protein (GFP) and the neomycin resistance gene\ninserted into the open reading frame of the nonessential thy-\nmidine kinase gene (34). We show that in these cells, the GFP\ngene is expressed during the lytic cycle with kinetics similar to\nthose of the early EBV lytic genes. Thus, cells expressing GFP\ncan be identi\ufb01ed, separated, and used for immunological or\nbiochemical analysis of changes caused by virus replication in\nEBV-infected cells. Our results show that even though multi-\nple mechanisms might operate during EBV lytic replication,\ninhibition of MHC class 1 heavy chains and \u00022m synthesis is\none of the key mechanisms of EBV-induced MHC class 1\ndownregulation.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell lines and induction of EBV replication. The Bx1g variants of the Burkitt\u2019s\nlymphoma cell line Akata (Akata Bx1g), the gastric carcinoma cell line AGS\n(AGS Bx1g), and the colorectal epithelial carcinoma cell line HCT116 (HCT116\nBx1g) were obtained by the infection of EBV-negative Akata, AGS, and HCT116\ncells with a recombinant virus originated from the EBV strain derived from the\nwild-type Akata cells. The recombinant virus was generated by introducing a\ncassette containing the neomycin resistance gene under the control of a thymi-\ndine kinase promoter and a modi\ufb01ed GFP gene under the control of the imme-\ndiate-early cytomegalovirus promoter into the open reading frame of the non-\nessential thymidine kinase gene (refer to reference 24 for more details on the\ngeneration of the virus). The Bx1g cell variants were grown in medium supple-\nmented with 500 \u0003g/ml of Geneticin sulfate (G418; Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis,\nMO). 1n Akata Bx1g cells, the EBV lytic cycle was induced by culturing in the\npresence of 50 \u0003g/ml goat F(ab\u0004)2 fragments speci\ufb01c to human immunoglobulin\nG (IgG; MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) for the indicated periods of time. The\nlytic cycle in AGS Bx1g and HCT116 Bx1g cells was induced by culturing for 24 h\nwith 30 ng/ml of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma Aldrich)\nand 0.5 mM sodium butyrate (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The chemicals were\nthen removed, and the culturing was continued for the indicated periods of time.\nAll cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with L-glutamine and 10%\nfetal calf serum.\nTo inhibit viral DNA replication and late lytic cycle gene expression or to block\nprotein synthesis, cells were cultured in the presence of 0.2 mM acyclovir\n(Alpharma, Oslo, Norway) or 50 \u0003g/ml cycloheximide (Sigma Aldrich), respectively.\nAntibodies. BZ.1 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) is a monoclonal antibody\n(MAb) speci\ufb01c to the immediate-early BZLF1 protein of EBV. 85K and 2L10\nare MAbs speci\ufb01c to the p85 early antigen of EBV and to the late envelope\nglycoprotein gp350/220, respectively. W6/32 (HB95; ATCC) is a pan-MHC class 1-speci\ufb01c MAb which recognizes heavy chains associated with \u00022m. r\u0005HC (rabbit\nanti-heavy chain) is a rabbit antiserum that recognizes free heavy chains of MHC\nclass 1 molecules encoded by the human leukocyte antigen A (HLA-A), B, or C\nlocus (32) and HC10 is a MAb that binds to a linear epitope exposed on free\nheavy chains of the HLA-B and -C loci (32). Both Abs were a kind gift of Hidde\nPloegh (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The anti-HLA-A (clone 108-\n2C5) and -HLA-B (clone Joan-1) MAbs were both from Lab Vision (Fremont,\nCA). The L31 Ab recognizes a linear \u00051 domain epitope exposed on free heavy\nchains of HLA-C (a kind gift of Louise Berg, Karolinska 1nstitute, Stockholm,\nSweden). Abs speci\ufb01c to ERp57 or calreticulin (both from StressGen, Victoria,\nCanada), calnexin (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), or tapasin (BD Bio-\nsciences) were used for both \ufb02ow cytometry and immunoblotting. Abs speci\ufb01c to\n\u00022m, clone TU\n\u00a8 99 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and TAP1 or TAP2 (BD\nBiosciences), as well as \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Ab against MHC\nclass 1, MHC class 1I, CD19, and CD86 (all from BD Biosciences) were used for\n\ufb02ow cytometry. Rabbit antiserum speci\ufb01c to \u00022m (Dako), Abs against the pro-\nteasomal subunits LMP2, LMP7, MECL1 (monoclonal antibodies), and \u00053 (rab-\nbit polyclonal) (Af\ufb01nity Research, Plymouth Meeting, PA) as well as GFP-\nspeci\ufb01c Ab (Roche, 1ndianapolis, 1N) or actin-speci\ufb01c Ab (Sigma Aldrich) were\nused only for immunoblotting. The tripeptidyl peptidase 1I (TPPII)-speci\ufb01c MAb\nwas from 1mmunesystem (Uppsala, Sweden). The TAP1- and TAP2-speci\ufb01c Abs\nused in immunoblotting were a kind gift from John Trowsdale (Cambridge 1nstitute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom). All antibody\npreparations used as isotype controls for \ufb02ow cytometry were purchased from\neither Dako or BD Biosciences. The goat anti-mouse allophycocyanin (APC)-\nconjugated antibody for indirect immunostaining was purchased from BD Bio-\nsciences. The relevant secondary antibodies for immunoblotting were purchased\nform Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden).\nFlow cytometry. At the indicated time points after induction, Akata Bx1g, AGS\nBx1g, or HCT116 Bx1g cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS), \ufb01xed for 25 min in Cyto\ufb01x/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences), washed three\ntimes in Perm/Wash solution (BD Biosciences), and blocked for 30 min on ice\nwith serum from an EBV-negative individual (5% in PBS). Samples were then\nincubated for 30 min on ice with primary unconjugated Abs, washed, and incu-\nbated with goat anti-mouse APC-conjugated Ab for an additional 30 min on ice.\nAll acquisitions were performed on a FACScalibur \ufb02ow cytometer and analyzed\nusing CellQuest (BD Biosciences). Double stainings were performed by labeling\ncells \ufb01rst with unconjugated BZLF1-speci\ufb01c Ab, whose binding was revealed by\nstaining with a relevant anti-mouse conjugate, as described above, followed by\nstaining with MHC class 1-, class 1I-, CD19-, or CD86-speci\ufb01c directly conjugated\nAb. Staining for HLA-C with L31 Ab, which recognizes free HLA-C heavy\nchains, was performed after the cells were treated for 2 min with a low-pH buffer\n(0.131 M citric acid, 0.066 M Na2HPO4, pH 3.3) to elute the peptides and\ndissociate the heavy chain from \u00022m.\nAnalysis of protein expression by immunoblotting. Akata Bx1g cells were\ninduced with 1gG-speci\ufb01c Abs for either 24 or 48 h and then sorted using a\nMoFlo sorter (Dako Cytomation) into GFP\u0001 and GFP\u0006 cells. 7AAD (BD\nBiosciences) was used to exclude dead cells during sorting. Cells were counted\nand pelleted, and the same numbers of GFP-positive cells and GFP-negative\ncells were lysed in reducing electrophoresis sample buffer (1 \u0007 106 cells/100 \u0003l).\nElectrophoresis was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gels or 8 to 16% poly-\nduramide gradient gels (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) and proteins were\ntransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Mem-\nbranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% skimmed milk and probed with\ndifferent primary Abs followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to horserad-\nish peroxidase. The signal was detected using Super Signal chemiluminescence\ndetection solution (Pierce, Rockford, 1L), and images were acquired on a LAS-\n3000 luminescent image analyzer (Fuji\ufb01lm Medical Systems, Stamford, CT).\nPulse-chase experiments, immunoprecipitation and MHC class 1 maturation.\nLytic cycle was induced in Akata Bx1g cells for 24 or 48 h, which were then sorted\ninto GFP\u0001 (lytic) and GFP\u0006 (latent), as described above. For metabolic labeling,\n2 \u0007 106 cells/sample were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, spun down, and resuspended in fresh\nprewarmed methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco\u2019s modi\ufb01ed Eagle\u2019s medium\n(DMEM) with 150 \u0003Ci of [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine (Redivue Pro-mix\nL-[35S] in vitro cell labeling mix; Amersham) and cultured for 2 h at 37\u00b0C.\nFor short pulse-chase experiments, cells were labeled for 2 min with 400 \u0003Ci\nRedivue Pro-mix. Labeling was terminated by the addition of nonradioactive\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS 1 DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1391\n\nL-methionine and L-cysteine (1 mM) (Sigma), and samples were pelleted and\nfrozen at time zero or at 5 and 30 min of chase.\nTo assess the role of protein degradation, cells were incubated in methionine-\nand cysteine-free DMEM at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of the proteasomal\ninhibitor lactacystine (10 \u0003M) and the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (4 \u0003M)\n(Sigma). Cells were labeled for 20 min with 400 \u0003Ci Redivue Pro-mix, washed,\nand then pelleted.\nFor the assessment of MHC class 1 maturation, cells were pulsed for 30 min,\nlabeling was terminated as described above, cells were washed once and reincu-\nbated in prewarmed DMEM containing excess unlabeled L-methionine and L-\ncysteine and 10% fetal calf serum. Samples were collected immediately after the\npulse (time zero) and at 1 h and 2 h of chase.\nSamples were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1\nmM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \ufb02uoride) on ice. After\n30 min, nuclei were removed by centrifugation (relative centrifugal force, 3,000;\n10 min). MHC class 1 molecules were immunoprecipitated with either W6/32 or\nr\u0005HC Abs after preclearing with mouse or rabbit serum, respectively.\nFor endo-\u0002-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endoH) digestion, immune com-\nplexes bound to protein A Sepharose beads were eluted by incubation at 95\u00b0C for\n5 min in elution buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate, 3 mM EDTA, 0.25% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate [SDS], pH 6.0). One half of each sample was digested overnight\nat 37\u00b0C with 2 mU endoH (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and the other half was\nmock digested. Samples were mixed with reducing electrophoresis loading buffer\nand analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on a 10%\npolyacrylamide gel. Gels were \ufb01xed (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 5% glyc-\nerol), vacuum dried, and incubated in a Hypercassette (Amersham), and the\nsignal was revealed in a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, GE\nHealthcare).\nReal-time RT-PCR (RNA preparation and reverse transcription). After in-\nduction of the lytic cycle, Akata Bx1g cells were sorted into GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001\npopulations, carefully counted, and RNA was extracted from 1 \u0007 106 cells of\neach population according to the instructions of the QIAGEN RNA blood\nminikit (Hilden, Germany). RNA was eluted with 30 \u0003l of RNase-free water.\nThe cDNA synthesis was performed in a total volume of 50 \u0003l containing 30 \u0003l\nRNA, 1 \u0007 \ufb01rst-strand buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM\nMgCl2), 105 \u0003g/ml pdN6 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), 1 mM of each\ndeoxynucleoside triphosphate (Amersham Biosciences), 1 mM dithiothreitol,\n0.48 units/\u0003l RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), and 4.8 units/\u0003l Moloney murine\nleukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT; 1nvitrogen, Paisley, Scotland), at 37\u00b0C\nfor 1.5 h. The reaction was stopped by heating at 68\u00b0C for 15 min.\nReal-time PCR. A total of 2.5 \u0003l of cDNA was used in a 25-\u0003l reaction mixture\ncontaining 1\u0007 SYBR green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 300 nM\nof each primer. Primers and primer sequences were as follows: HLA class 1-F,\n5\u0004-ACC TGG AGA ACG GGA AGG A-3\u0004; HLA class 1-R, 5\u0004-TGT GAT CTC\nCGC AGG GTA GAA-3\u0004; \u00022m-F, 5\u0004-GAT GAG TAT GCC TGC CGT GTG-3\u0004;\n\u00022m-R, 5\u0004-CAA TCC AAA TGC GGC ATC T-3\u0004; G6PD-F, 5\u0004-TGC CCC CGA\nCCG TCT AC-3\u0004; G6PD-R, 5\u0004-ATG CGG TTC CAG CCT ATC TG-3\u0004; ABL-F,\n5\u0004-CGA AGG GAG GGT GTA CCA TTA C-3\u0004; ABL-R, 5\u0004-CGT TGA ATG\nATG ATG AAC CAA CTC-3\u0004. The PCR was performed and analyzed on the\nABI 7000 sequence detection system with the following PCR conditions: 50\u00b0C for\n2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 PCR ampli\ufb01cation cycles with 95\u00b0C for\n15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Relative quanti\ufb01cation of gene expression was calculated\naccording to the Delta-Delta CT method. The formula used was 2\b\tCT\n, where \tCT\nequals the cycle threshold (CT) of a given gene in GFP\u0001 cells minus the CT of the\nsame gene in GFP\u0006 cells.\nRESULTS\nAn alternative model for EBV lytic replication. Analysis of\nEBV lytic replication has been hampered by the lack of suit-\nable permissive systems of virus infection. Recently, Ressing et\nal. described a new experimental model of EBV replication\nbased on transfection of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma Akata cells with a\nplasmid encoding the rat CD2 extracellular and transmem-\nbrane domains, with the cytosolic domain replaced with GFP\n(29). Expression of the fusion protein in this construct is driven\nby the BMRF1 early gene promoter. Upon induction of the\nlytic cycle by cross-linking of surface immunoglobulins, trans-\nfected cells supporting virus replication could be either studied\nbased on their GFP expression or isolated with anti-rat CD2\nbeads (29).\nWe made use of an alternative system in which a cassette\nencoding the GFP gene under control of the CMV immediate-\nearly promoter was inserted into the open reading frame of the\nnonessential thymidine kinase gene of the wild-type Akata\nvirus (34). This recombinant virus was used to infect an EBV-\nnegative variant of the Akata cell line, the gastric carcinoma\ncell line AGS, and the colorectal epithelial carcinoma cell line\nHCT116, generating EBV-positive cell lines referred to as\nAkata Bx1g, AGS Bx1g, and HCT116 Bx1g, respectively.\nCultures of cells infected with the recombinant virus typi-\ncally contained a small population of cells in lytic replication\n(Fig. 1A, upper panels; data not shown for HCT116 Bx1g\ncells). 1n Akata Bx1g cells, the expression of the immediate-\nearly gene BZLF1 quite strictly coincided with expression of\nGFP, whereas both GFP single-positive and GFP/BZLF1 dou-\nble-positive populations could be clearly distinguished in AGS\nBx1g cells and HCT116 Bx1g cells before and after induction\nof the lytic cycle. This probably re\ufb02ects the higher steady-state\nactivity of the CMV promoter in epithelial cells. Upon induc-\ntion of the lytic cycle by surface 1gG cross-linking or TPA and\nsodium butyrate, the proportions of Akata Bx1g and AGS\nBx1g cells replicating EBV increased from approximately 2%\nto 40% and from 3% to 10%, respectively. 1n accordance with previous reports, cells supporting lytic\nreplication expressed decreased surface levels of MHC class 1\n(Fig. 1A, lower panels, and B) and MHC class 1I (Fig. 1C). 1nduction of the virus lytic cycle increased the number of cells\nwith low levels of surface MHC class 1 in Akata Bx1g, AGS\nBx1g (Fig. 1A and B, lower panels), and HCT116 Bx1g (data\nnot shown) cells, although the kinetics of this process was\nslower in the epithelial cells, with visible increase of the GFP/\nBZLF1 double-positive population only 48 h posttreatment\nand onwards. 1n our experimental model, 1g cross-linking or\nTPA-sodium butyrate treatment led to an increase in MHC\nclass 1 expression on the surface of cells that remained in\nlatency compared to that on control untreated cells (Fig. 1B,\nupper panels). This observation contrasts with the \ufb01ndings of\nRessing et al., who observed no difference in MHC class 1\nexpression between anti-Ig-treated and untreated cells latently\ninfected with the virus (29). Therefore, in all experiments, we\ncompared GFP\u0001 cells replicating the virus with the GFP\u0006\npopulation within the same cultures exposed to lytic cycle-\ninducing stimuli.\nTo exclude the possibility that the observed effect of virus\nreplication on MHC class 1 expression was caused by the ex-\npression of GFP or other unknown effects mediated by the\nrecombinant virus, wild-type Akata cells were induced to rep-\nlicate EBV and then costained with the BZLF1-speci\ufb01c anti-\nbody and one of the antibodies speci\ufb01c to MHC class 1, MHC\nclass 1I, CD19, or CD86 (Fig. 1C). As previously reported,\nsurface expression of CD19 and CD86 remained unchanged,\nwhereas levels of MHC class 1 and 1I were decreased in cells\nreplicating the virus. All classical MHC class 1 alleles were\ndownregulated by approximately 60% on average in lytically\ninfected Akata Bx1g cells as revealed by staining with antibod-\nies that recognize pan-HLA-A, pan-HLA-B, or pan-HLA-C\n(Fig. 1D).\nTo get an insight into the role of different EBV proteins in\n1392\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nFIG. 1. EBV lytic replication results in GFP expression and MHC class 1 downregulation in Akata Bx1g and AGS Bx1g cells. Akata cells\ncarrying a recombinant EBV strain with the GFP gene inserted under the immediate-early CMV promoter into the virus genome (Akata Bx1g\ncells) or AGS gastric epithelial cells infected with the same virus (AGS Bx1g cells) were treated as described in Materials and Methods to induce\nthe EBV lytic cycle. Staining with the indicated speci\ufb01c antibodies and \ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis were performed as\ndescribed in Materials and Methods. A. EBV replication, GFP expression, and MHC class 1 downregulation coincide in Akata Bx1g and AGS Bx1g\ncells. To induce EBV replication, cells were cultured either with F(ab\u0004)2 fragments speci\ufb01c to human 1gG for the indicated periods of time (Akata\nBx1g) or with TPA and sodium butyrate (AGS Bx1g) for 24 h, washed, and incubated in standard culture medium for the remaining time of\ninduction. The four upper panels show intracellular staining for BZLF1. The lower panels show surface staining for MHC class 1 using W6/32\nantibody. 1n both cases, anti-mouse APC-conjugated antibody was used to detect binding of primary antibodies. The R1 and R2 regions in the\nlower panels de\ufb01ne two different cell populations, GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells, respectively, that were used for FACS analysis and cell sorting in this\nand all subsequent experiments. B. Signals used to activate the EBV lytic cycle in Akata or AGS cells induce overall upregulation of MHC class 1, which is overridden by virus replication. Surface staining for MHC class 1 was done with W6/32 antibody and APC-conjugated anti-mouse\nsecondary antibody. The upper panel shows the expression of MHC class 1 in the total population of either control (noninduced) or anti-IgG-\ntreated (Akata-induced) or TPA-butyrate-treated (AGS-induced) cells. The four lower panels show either control or induced cells, each divided\ninto GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 populations. The histograms are presented to illustrate the distribution of cells with different levels of MHC class 1\nexpression in cultures replicating the virus. C. Wild-type Akata cells downregulate MHC class 1 and MHC class 1I molecules upon induction of\nthe EBV lytic cycle. Wild-type EBV-positive Akata cells were incubated with F(ab\u0004)2 fragments speci\ufb01c to human 1gG for 24 h. 1ndirect\nintracellular staining for BZLF1 was followed by staining with directly conjugated MHC class 1-, class 1I-, CD19-, or CD86-speci\ufb01c antibody. Cells\nwere gated as BZLF1 positive (pos) or BZLF1 negative (neg). The geometric means of \ufb02uorescence intensities (Geo MFI) of the gated populations\nare shown. D. HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles are downregulated to similar extents during EBV replication. At 24 h after induction, the levels of surface\nexpression of classical MHC class 1 molecules were assessed in Akata Bx1g cells with either a pan-MHC class 1-speci\ufb01c antibody (W6/32) or\nantibodies speci\ufb01cally recognizing HLA-A, -B, or -C alleles. The geometric means of \ufb02uorescence intensity obtained with each of the indicated\nantibodies for GFP-positive cells are shown as percentages relative to those of anti-IgG-treated GFP-negative (latent) cells (the means and\nstandard deviations of three experiments).\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS 1 DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1393\n\nthe downregulation of MHC class 1 expression, we \ufb01rst as-\nsessed the kinetics of this process in relation to the kinetics of\nexpression of immediate-early, early or late EBV proteins fol-\nlowing induction of the lytic cycle. The immediate-early gene\nBZLF1 was already expressed after 6 h of induction of the\nlytic cycle in Akata Bx1g cells (Fig. 2). Early gene expres-\nsion, assessed by staining for the EA-R protein, was unde-\ntectable at 6 h but picked up at 12 h, when virtually all cells\nexpressing immediate-early genes also expressed early genes\n(Fig. 2A). At this time point, a small proportion of cells\nalready expressed late genes, as assessed by staining for the\nenvelope glycoprotein gp350/220, but late gene expression\nby the majority of GFP\u0001 cells was seen only at 24 h. The\npercentage of cells that express lytic cycle genes peaked at\n24 h, followed by a decrease at 48 h, which could be due to\ncell death as a result of lytic replication. Surface MHC class 1 was slightly upregulated at 6 h postinduction in cells that\nexpressed BZLF1 in comparison to cells that were subjected\nto anti-Ig treatment but remained in latency. This upregu-\nlation was quickly reverted, and by 12 h, MHC class 1 was\nreduced by 20%; the extent of downregulation continued to\nincrease, reaching its peak at 48 h. The degree of downregu-\nlation varied between individual experiments but averaged\n60% by 48 h.\nThe fact that the surface levels of MHC class 1 were already\ndecreased by 12 h postinduction, as well as the fact that as-\nsembled molecules should have an average half-life of 6 to 8 h,\nsuggested that MHC class 1 downregulation is induced by an\nimmediate-early or early EBV proteins. 1n agreement with this\nassumption and previously published data (16), acyclovir\ngreatly decreased late gene expression in induced Akata cells\nand reduced percentages of cells expressing BZLF1 but did not\nsigni\ufb01cantly affect the levels of BZLF1 expression and MHC\nclass 1 downregulation in BZLF1-positive cells (Fig. 2B).\nFIG. 2. MHC class 1 downregulation is independent of virus DNA replication. A. MHC class 1 downregulation is an early event in the virus\nlytic cycle. The lytic cycle was induced in Akata Bx1g cells by 1gG cross-linking, and the levels of expression of immediate-early (BZLF1), early\n(EA-R-p85), and late (gp350/220) lytic cycle antigens were assessed by intracellular staining. 1n parallel, surface MHC class 1 was detected at each\ntime point after induction. Percentages of cells positive for each of the antigens at the indicated time points are shown on the left y axis, whereas\nthe relative MHC class 1 downregulation in GFP-positive cells compared with the GFP-negative cells is shown on the right y axis. B. MHC class 1 downregulation is independent of virus DNA replication and late gene expression. Akata Bx1g cells were induced by 1gG cross-linking in the\npresence or absence of 0.2 mM acyclovir. At the indicated time points, cells were collected and stained for intracellular BZLF1 or gp350/220\nexpression. The numbers inside the dot plots indicate percentages of cells in the relevant quadrants. Mean \ufb02uorescence intensity of BZLF1-speci\ufb01c\nstaining is shown for cells positive for both GFP and BZLF1. 1n parallel, samples were also stained for surface MHC class 1, and the percentage\nof MHC class 1 downregulation was assessed as described above. The results of this analysis are shown on the graph.\n1394\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nThe total pool of MHC class 1 heavy chains and \u00012m is\ndownregulated, whereas free heavy chains accumulate in cells\nreplicating EBV. To understand the fate of MHC class 1 in\ncells replicating EBV, we \ufb01rst asked whether the surface down-\nregulation of assembled molecules re\ufb02ected the overall de-\ncrease of heavy chain expression in these cells. Akata Bx1g\ncells were sorted into GFP\u0006 (latent) and GFP\u0001 (lytic) popu-\nlations at 48 h after induction. Western blot analysis of total\ncell lysates showed that lytic replication reduces the expression\nof MHC class 1 heavy chains as detected by two different heavy\nchain-speci\ufb01c antibodies (Fig. 3A). Levels of \u00022m were also\nstrongly reduced. 1n accordance with downregulation of assem-\nbled MHC class 1 at the cell surface (Fig. 1), cells subjected to\nsurface 1gG cross-linking but remaining in latency (GFP\u0006)\nexpressed slightly increased amounts of heavy chains in total\ncell lysates compared to noninduced controls (Fig. 4A). Cells\nin the lytic cycle had reduced levels of total heavy chains in\nFIG. 3. Free heavy chains accumulate during lytic replication.

B.

N.D., not detected.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS 1 DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1395\n\ncomparison to either noninduced or induced but latently in-\nfected cells.\nNext, we studied the expression of assembled MHC class 1,\nfree heavy chains, and \u00022m both at the cell surface and in\npermeabilized cells, the latter re\ufb02ecting the total pool of the\nanalyzed molecules. The density plots in Fig. 3B show a typical\nsurface staining for these molecules at 48 h postinduction.\nBoth assembled MHC class 1 and \u00022m were decreased in\npermeabilized cells and on the surface of GFP\u0001 cells com-\npared to GFP\u0006 cells at 24 h postinduction, and this downregu-\nlation became more pronounced at 48 h (Fig. 3B). 1n contrast,\nthe levels of free heavy chain, detected by the MAb HC10,\nwere unchanged at 24 h and tended to increase at 48 h in lytic\ncells compared to those in cells in latency. Also, downregula-\ntion of \u00022m at the cell surface was statistically more signi\ufb01cant\n(P value in nonpaired t test, 0.01) than that of assembled MHC\nclass 1 after 48 h of lytic cycle induction. A stronger downregu-\nlation of \u00022m was also revealed upon staining of permeabilized\ncells after 24 h of induction (P value, 0.002). Taken together,\nthese results reveal that during EBV replication, expression\nlevels of both heavy chains and \u00022m are downregulated, and\n\u00022m seems to be reduced to a greater extent. At the same time,\nboth the total pool and surface fraction of free heavy chains are\nincreased, suggesting that free heavy chains selectively accu-\nmulate at the surface of cells supporting the lytic cycle.\nProteins that aid the generation of folded and peptide-\nloaded MHC class 1 are modulated during EBV lytic replica-\ntion. To investigate whether other mechanisms, in addition to\ndecreased expression of heavy chains and \u00022m, contribute to\nMHC class 1 downregulation in lytically infected cells, expres-\nsion of several components of the MHC class 1 processing\npathway in GFP\u0001 and GFP\u0006 Akata Bx1g cells was analyzed by\nimmunoblotting. GFP\u0006 cells were always negative for BZLF1\nexpression regardless of the time period between induction of\nthe lytic cycle and cell sorting (24 or 48 h). No signi\ufb01cant\nchanges could be observed in the expression of LMP2, LMP7,\nand MECL-1 subunits of the immunoproteasome (Fig. 4A),\nnor was there a change in the expression of the nonproteolytic\nconstitutive \u00053 proteasomal subunit. TPPII, another cytosolic\npeptidase implicated in the generation of MHC class 1 peptide\nepitopes, was slightly downregulated.\nTo compare the expression levels of peptide transporters\nand ER chaperones that play a role in the assembly and pep-\ntide loading of MHC class 1, both immunoblotting and \ufb02ow\ncytometry analysis of protein expression at the cell surface and\nin permeabilized cells were used as described for Fig. 3 and in\nMaterials and Methods. Signi\ufb01cant accumulation of calnexin\nwas observed mostly in the intracellular compartments of cells\nin the lytic cycle after 24 h of induction. 1n contrast, calreticulin\naccumulated on the surface, while its overall expression was\nreduced by up to 50% (Fig. 4). Expression of the chaperone\nERp57 showed a general reduction. Tapasin, TAP1, and TAP2\ncould not be detected at the cell surface by \ufb02ow cytometry, and\ntheir overall levels were not modulated signi\ufb01cantly, as de-\ntected by immunoblotting, with the exception of TAP2, whose\nexpression was decreased by approximately 30% (Fig. 4).\nMHC class 1 synthesis is reduced during lytic replication.\nHerpesviruses target MHC class 1 molecules for degradation\nthrough a number of mechanisms (31). Therefore, we investi-\ngated whether the decrease of MHC class 1 heavy chain ex-\npression in the course of EBV replication is due to inhibition\nof heavy chain synthesis or targeted protein degradation. 1n-\nduced and sorted Akata Bx1g cells were labeled with [35S]me-\nthionine and [35S]cysteine, and their lysates were immunopre-\ncipitated with W6/32 or r\u0005\u000bC antibodies speci\ufb01c to assembled\nMHC class 1 or free heavy chains, respectively. After 2 h of\nlabeling, most labeled heavy chains were associated with \u00022m\nand recovered with W6/32 antibody from control cells (Fig.\n5A). Comparison of GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells revealed a drastic\nreduction in 35S-labeled W6/32- and r\u0005HC-reactive molecules\nin cells replicating the virus. The amount of de novo-synthe-\nsized MHC class 1 molecules was strongly reduced, by approx-\nimately 85% in GFP\u0001 cells. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation\nof [35S]methionine-labeled cellular proteins revealed that cells\nin the lytic cycle incorporated the amino acid at 25% of the\nlevel of GFP\u0006 cells in latency (data not shown). This is con-\nsistent with overall inhibition of protein synthesis in cells rep-\nlicating the virus. However, heavy chain downregulation ob-\nserved by immunoblotting of total lysates of the same cells was\nrelatively moderate, reaching only about 40% reduction in\nband intensity (Fig. 5B).\nThese results could re\ufb02ect two non-mutually exclusive sce-\nnarios, that heavy chains are synthesized at a low rate or newly\nmade molecules are rapidly degraded. To address this ques-\ntion, we performed pulse-chase experiments on sorted cell\npopulations, in which cells were metabolically labeled for 2 min\nand chased immediately at time zero or 5 or 30 min postlabel-\ning. The cell lysates were sequentially immunoprecipitated\nwith W6/32 and r\u0005HC antibodies (Fig. 5C). 1n cells infected\nwith EBV latently, r\u0005HC-reactive molecules were visible at\ntime zero and their intensity decreased at the subsequent time\npoints, whereas the amount of assembled, W6/32-reactive\nMHC class 1 molecules increased over time. However, both\nW6/32- and r\u0005HC-reactive molecules were practically unde-\ntectable in cells replicating the virus, supporting the notion that\nthe rate of MHC class 1 synthesis is low during the EBV lytic\ncycle. This experiment still did not rule out completely the\npossibility that heavy chains are synthesized but degraded im-\nmediately. Therefore, we pretreated cells with a combination\nof lactacystin, a speci\ufb01c inhibitor of the proteasome, and chlo-\nroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation, and then per-\nformed metabolic labeling and sequential immunoprecipita-\ntion as described above (Fig. 5D). 1mmunoprecipitation of\nlysates of GFP\u0006 cells with the W6/32 and r\u0005HC antibodies\nshowed an accumulation of relevant protein moieties in cells\npretreated with the inhibitors. 1n contrast, neither W6/32- nor\nr\u0005HC-reactive species were revealed in cells replicating EBV\neven upon inhibition of protein degradation. 1mmunoprecipi-\ntation of \u00022m also performed in this series of experiments\ndemonstrated that its synthesis was inhibited in GFP\u0001 cells to\nan extent comparable to that observed for MHC class 1 heavy\nchains (data not shown).\nTo investigate whether decreased transcription/increased\nturnover of mRNA contributes to the decrease of MHC class 1 heavy chain synthesis, the abundance of mRNA message for\nthe classical MHC class 1 molecules and \u00022m was determined\nusing real-time RT-PCR analysis. Since CT values for mRNA\nof housekeeping genes (G6PD [glucose-6-phosphate dehydro-\ngenase] and Abl protein kinase genes) were increased in GFP\u0001\ncells (data not shown), normalization to housekeeping gene\n1396\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nFIG. 5. Reduced synthesis of MHC class 1 is associated with inhibition of transcription during lytic replication. Akata Bx1g cells were induced\nwith anti-IgG for either 48 h (A and B) or 24 h (C, D, E, F, and G) and then sorted into GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 populations. Both populations were\nincubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM prior to metabolic labeling. The bands shown in all experiments correspond\nto the heavy chain of MHC class 1 (\f45 kDa). A. Synthesis of MHC class 1 heavy chains is inhibited during EBV replication. Cells were\nmetabolically labeled for 2 h as described in Materials and Methods and immunoprecipitated with W6/32 or r\u0005HC antibody. Samples were\nseparated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography of dried gels was performed using a PhosphorImager. B. The levels of newly synthesized MHC class 1 heavy chains are reduced during lytic replication. Equal numbers of GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells were either lysed directly in SDS-containing lysis buffer\nor labeled with [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine mix for 2 h and immunoprecipitated with W6/32 as described above. Total cell lysates (TCL) were\nseparated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose \ufb01lters, and probed for the heavy chain and actin speci\ufb01c antibody as a loading control.\nC. Rapid degradation does not appear to account for the decreased levels of newly synthesized heavy chains. Cells were labeled with [35S]me-\nthionine-[35S]cysteine mix for 2 min and incorporation of radioactivity was terminated by the addition of 1 mM of nonradioactive L-methionine\nand L-cysteine. Samples were pelleted and frozen either immediately (time zero) or after 5 and 30 min of chase, followed by sequential\nimmunoprecipitation with W6/32 and r\u0005HC antibody. Electrophoresis and autoradiography were performed as described above. D. 1nhibitors of\nproteasomal or lysosomal degradation do not recover expression of newly synthesized heavy chains. Cells were incubated in methionine- and\ncysteine-free DMEM for 1 h in the presence of both proteasomal inhibitor lactacysin (10 \u0003M) and lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (4 \u0003M), labeled\nfor 20 min with 400 \u0003Ci [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine followed by sequential immunoprecipitation with W6/32 and r\u0005HC, electrophoresis, and\nautoradiography. E. MHC class 1 heavy chain and \u00022m mRNA are reduced in cells in lytic replication. After sorting, GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells were\ncarefully counted and pellets of equal numbers of cells were used for reverse transcription and RT-PCR analysis of MHC class 1 and \u00022m mRNA.\nValues of relative expression of these mRNAs in GFP\u0001 relative to GFP\u0006 cells are shown. Means and standard deviations of three independent\nexperiments. F. 1nhibition of protein synthesis mimics the effect of lytic replication on downregulation of assembled surface MHC class 1 and class 1I molecules. Akata Bx1g cells were either cultured in control medium, treated with 50 \u0003g/ml cycloheximide or induced into lytic cycle for 24 h\nand then stained for surface MHC class 1 and 1I. The expression levels of MHC class 1 and 1I on both GFP\u0001 and cycloheximide-treated cells are\nshown as percentages relative to those in GFP\u0006 or untreated cells, respectively. G. Assembled MHC class 1 molecules synthesized in lytically\ninfected cells are delayed in their maturation. Cells metabolically labeled for 30 min were incubated in prewarmed DMEM containing excesses of\nunlabeled L-methionine and L-cysteine and 10% fetal calf serum. Samples were collected immediately after the pulse (time zero) and at 1 h or 2 h\nof incubation. After immunoprecipitation with W6/32, assembled MHC class 1 was eluted from the Sepharose beads, digested by endoH (2 mM)\nand separated by SDS-PAGE together with nondigested controls. The line graph shows ratios between the intensities of endoH-resistant\nand -sensitive bands in GFP\u0001 and GFP\u0006 cells.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS 1 DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1397\n\nexpression levels could not be used to assess the abundance of\nMHC class 1 and \u00022m mRNAs. 1nstead, normalization was\nachieved by extracting mRNA from equal numbers of sorted\nGFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells. As shown in Fig. 5E, the mRNA mes-\nsage for MHC class 1 was reduced by an average of 70%,\nwhereas the \u00022m message was reduced by approximately 60%.\nTo test directly whether global inhibition of protein synthesis\ncan cause MHC class 1 downregulation in Akata Bx1g cells\nwithin the timeframe of experiments performed in this study,\ncells were either treated to induce the lytic cycle or incubated\nwith 50 \u0003g/ml of cycloheximide for 24 h (Fig. 5F). GFP\u0001 cells\nwere compared to anti-Ig-treated GFP\u0006 cells, while untreated\ncells served as a control for cycloheximide-treated cells. EBV\nreplication and inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide\nresulted in comparable reduction of MHC class 1 and class 1I\nexpression. 1nhibition of TAP-mediated peptide translocation into the\nER during EBV replication has been previously suggested\n(29). Our results revealed a slight inhibition of TAP2 expres-\nsion as well as downregulation of TPPII and ERp57 in cells\nreplicating the virus. All these changes could decrease the\nef\ufb01ciency of peptide supply and loading in lytically infected\ncells, thereby affecting the kinetics of MHC class 1 progression\nthrough the ER and Golgi apparatus. To assess the ef\ufb01ciency\nof this process, Akata Bx1g cells were induced, sorted, labeled\nfor 30 min with [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine, and chased at\nthe indicated time points after the pulse. After immunopre-\ncipitation with W6/32 antibodies, samples were divided and\neither mock treated or treated with endoH, an enzyme which\nremoves N-linked oligosaccharides attached to proteins in the\nER but does not trim modi\ufb01ed versions of these sugars ac-\nquired in the Golgi compartment. 1t has been previously dem-\nonstrated that the kinetics of MHC class 1 maturation is rela-\ntively slow in Akata cells due to their intrinsically low TAP\nactivity (10, 17). Accordingly, a proportion of MHC class 1\nmolecules remained endoH sensitive even after 2 h of chase in\nthe control GFP-negative cells (Fig. 5G). 1n agreement with\nthe previous experiments, bands of very low intensity were\ndetected in MHC class 1 immunoprecipitates from the lysates\nof GFP\u0001 Akata Bx1g cells. Although it was clear that MHC\nclass 1 molecules in cells replicating EBV progress to the Golgi,\ndensitometry of endoH-sensitive and endoH-resistant bands\nindicated that there was a delay in MHC class 1 maturation\nduring the EBV lytic cycle. However, this delay was revealed\nonly upon a comparison of samples obtained at 2 h of chase\nand its signi\ufb01cance for the phenomenon of MHC class 1 down-\nregulation remains unclear.\nDISCUSSION\nStudy of EBV replication was hampered for a long time by\nthe lack of a permissive in vitro system. We hereby present a\nmodel for studying EBV replication that is based on a recom-\nbinant virus which drives GFP expression in infected cells\nduring the lytic cycle, enabling us to distinguish and sort cells\nsupporting virus replication from cells that remain in latency.\nWe found that, at least in Akata Bx1g cells, GFP expression,\ndriven by the immediate-early CMV promoter from a cassette\ninserted into the thymidine kinase gene of the EBV genome,\nlargely coincides with expression of early and late lytic cycle\ngenes. The fact that high levels of GFP expression in Akata\nBx1g cells are observed only upon induction of the lytic cycle is\nmost likely explained by upregulation of the CMV promoter\nactivity or regulatory effects of the two thymidine kinase pro-\nmoters which lie upstream of the CMV promoter in the re-\ncombinant EBV strain and become activated in cells support-\ning EBV replication. An increase in EBV copy numbers during\nthe lytic cycle is unlikely to contribute to this phenomenon,\nbecause inhibition of EBV DNA synthesis by acyclovir does\nnot signi\ufb01cantly affect GFP expression in anti-Ig-stimulated\nAkata cells. 1n the present study, we utilized this model to\nanalyze the in\ufb02uence of the EBV lytic cycle on the MHC class 1 processing and presentation pathway. We observed that EBV\nreplication results in MHC class 1 downregulation at the cell\nsurface of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma Akata cells, as well as the epi-\nthelial cell lines AGS and HCT116, infected with the recom-\nbinant EBV strain (Fig. 1). Kinetic analysis of viral gene ex-\npression in Akata cells indicated that the MHC class 1\ndownregulation precedes the expression of late genes of the\nEBV lytic cycle. Accordingly, treatment with acyclovir, which\nblocks late EBV gene expression and virus DNA replication,\ndid not prevent MHC class 1 downregulation in cells expressing\nGFP and BZLF1 following anti-Ig cross-linking (Fig. 2). 1t is\nnot surprising that the recombinant virus retains sensitivity to\nacyclovir even though its thymidine kinase gene is disrupted,\nbecause EBV thymidine kinase does not phosphorylate acyclo-\nvir and the effect of this drug is determined by the exquisite\nsensitivity of the viral DNA polymerase to phosphorylated\nacyclovir presumably generated by cellular or other viral ki-\nnases (12, 26).\nMHC class 1 downregulation in the course of EBV replica-\ntion observed in our model recapitulates recent \ufb01ndings by\nRessing et al., who characterized this phenomenon by using\nEBV-positive Akata cells transfected with a reporter plasmid\nin which expression of the extracellular and transmembrane\ndomains of the rat CD2 molecule, with GFP replacing the\nfunctional cytosolic domain, is driven by the early BZLF1-\nresponsive promoter (29). Here we extend this \ufb01nding towards\nmore extensive characterization of the MHC class 1-processing\npathway during the course of EBV replication. We demon-\nstrate that the expression levels of MHC class 1 molecules\nencoded by each of the three loci, A, B, or C, are decreased to\nsimilar extents on the surface of cells in the lytic cycle (Fig.\n1D). This correlates with signi\ufb01cantly decreased levels of MHC\nclass 1 heavy chains and \u00022m in total cell lysates (Fig. 3 and 4). 1nterestingly, Ressing et al. have not observed any modulation\nof heavy chain levels in their model of EBV replication (29).\nThis discrepancy can be partly explained by the fact that in the\nprevious study, cells replicating the virus were compared to\nuntreated cells in culture, while we observed a signi\ufb01cant MHC\nclass 1 upregulation on the surface of cells which were sub-\njected to lytic cycle-inducing stimuli, e.g., anti-Ig antibody, but\nremained in latency (Fig. 1B). Therefore, in our analysis, we\nalways compared cells in the lytic cycle to similarly treated cells\nin latency obtained by sorting the same cell culture into GFP\u0001\nand GFP\u0006 populations. 1n contrast to the changes observed in\nthe total pool of heavy chains, free heavy chains accumulated\nin cells supporting EBV replication (Fig. 3B). 1n activated\nhuman T cells, MHC class 1 molecules coexist in two confor-\nmation states, folded and misfolded, and can be identi\ufb01ed by\n1398\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nthe monoclonal antibodies W6/32 and HC10, respectively. 1n\nthese cells, the pool of misfolded heavy chains is found in\nassociation with calreticulin and ERp57 (3, 30). Our results\npoint to a possible role of both calreticulin and calnexin in\nstabilizing different pools of free heavy chains. Although cal-\nreticulin and, to a lesser extent, calnexin accumulate on the\nsurface of cells supporting the virus lytic cycle, the levels of\ncalreticulin in total cell lysates are reduced, whereas calnexin is\nincreased (Fig. 4). This suggests that a proportion of free heavy\nchains could be stabilized by calnexin intracellularly, whereas\ncalreticulin aids their stabilization at the surface. 1t is also\npossible that some free heavy chains associated with chaper-\nones and especially with calreticulin acquire a folded confor-\nmation, which is seen by the W6/32 antibody. That could ex-\nplain why \u00022m seems to be downregulated to a greater extent\nthan assembled MHC class 1 molecules in cells replicating the\nvirus (Fig. 3B).\nAlthough it has been suggested that free heavy chains and\nMHC class 1 molecules devoid of peptides can interact with\nNK cell receptors and modulate the functional outcome of\ntarget cell recognition by NK cells (2, 7, 22), it remains to be\nestablished whether the accumulation of free MHC class 1\nheavy chains at the cell surface serves any immunological func-\ntion in cells replicating EBV.\nCalreticulin is found in the ER membrane, the nucleus, and\non the cell surface of most mammalian cells. Cellular stress,\nincluding apoptosis, induces expression of calreticulin and\nleads to an increase of its cell surface expression and redistri-\nbution, whereby calreticulin becomes associated with phospha-\ntidylserine (11). At least in part, the surface accumulation of\ncalreticulin could be a re\ufb02ection of apoptotic changes associ-\nated with EBV replication but could also have different func-\ntional implications. Calreticulin has been shown to interact\nwith perforin and inhibit perforin-mediated killing. This pro-\ntection seems to occur independently of direct interaction with\nperforin, and it has been proposed that calreticulin stabilizes\nthe membrane and prevents pore formation induced by per-\nforin (9). Although MHC class 1 downregulation may lead to\nincreased sensitivity of cells to NK lysis (20), functional con-\nsequences of EBV replication in terms of its effect on recog-\nnition by CTLs or NK cells remain to be characterized, and\ncalreticulin could affect perforin-mediated lysis of EBV-in-\nfected cells during the lytic cycle.\nPulse-chase analysis of MHC class 1 molecules in cells rep-\nlicating EBV showed a strong reduction in the levels of newly\nmade heavy chains and \u00022m (Fig. 5). Targeting proteins for\ndegradation is a common strategy utilized by herpesviruses to\nensure their persistence and/or escape from immune surveil-\nlance (see reference 27 for a review). 1n particular, cytomeg-\nalovirus encodes at least two proteins, US2 and US11, which\ntarget MHC class 1 heavy chains for retrograde transport from\nthe ER to cytosol (21, 35). A decrease in the amount of newly\nmade heavy chains was clearly detected after brief metabolic\nlabeling and could not be rescued by a combination of protea-\nsomal and lysosomal inhibitors, strongly suggesting that target-\ning of heavy chains for protein degradation does not play a role\nin the observed MHC class 1 downregulation (Fig. 5C and D).\nRessing et al. have shown that the functional activity of the\nTAP heterodimer is inhibited during EBV replication, al-\nthough the expression of TAP1 and TAP2 appeared to be\nunaffected (29). 1n our system, expression of TAP2, but not\nTAP1, was decreased by about 30% in cells supporting virus\nreplication (Fig. 4). We also observed downregulation of\nERp57, another functionally important member of the peptide\nloading complex, and TPPII, an endopeptidase implicated in\nthe generation of peptide ligands presented by MHC class 1\nmolecules. These changes could, indeed, result in a lower ef-\n\ufb01ciency of MHC class 1 assembly, which is usually re\ufb02ected in\ndelayed class 1 maturation, as assessed by changes in the\nendoH sensitivity of sugars attached to these molecules and\nmodi\ufb01ed during their progression from the ER to the Golgi\ncompartment. We detected a delay in MHC class 1 maturation\nduring the EBV lytic cycle in Akata cells; however, this delay\nwas revealed only upon comparison of samples obtained at 2 h\nof chase (Fig. 5G), and its signi\ufb01cance for the phenomenon of\nMHC class 1 downregulation remains unclear. 1t is conceivable\nthat strong inhibition of MHC class 1 heavy chain synthesis\nobserved during EBV replication minimizes competition of\nnewly produced heavy chains for available peptide ligands,\neven if the latter are supplied at a decreased rate due to\ninhibition of the TAP heterodimer. Whether inhibition of TAP\nfunction plays a more signi\ufb01cant role at a particular stage of\nthe virus lytic cycle remains to be determined.\nNonspeci\ufb01c inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide\ncauses downregulation of MHC class 1 comparable to that\nobserved in Akata cells during the EBV lytic cycle (Fig. 5F).\nThe notion that the inhibition of MHC class 1 heavy chain and\n\u00022m synthesis plays the primary role in MHC class 1 down-\nregulation in the course of EBV replication is consistent with\na recent demonstration of skewing of EBV lytic cycle-speci\ufb01c\nCTL responses towards the immediate-early and early proteins\n(28). 1n this scenario, the immediate-early and early proteins\ncould be still processed and presented before the virus-induced\ninhibition of protein synthesis comes into force and the existing\npool of nonassembled heavy chains and \u00022m gets depleted. A\ndetailed discussion of mechanisms which could account for the\ninhibition of MHC class 1 synthesis by the immediate-early or\nearly proteins of the EBV lytic cycle is outside the scope of this\narticle. 1t has been proposed that the activity of LMP1, which\ninduces the 1RF7 transcription factor and upregulates MHC\nclass 1 expression (37, 38), can be counteracted by BZLF1\nthrough its interference with 1RF7 (14). MHC class 1 upregu-\nlation induced by B-cell-receptor triggering involves NF-\rB\nand can also be counteracted by BZLF1 through its interfer-\nence with the NF-\rB p65 subunit (13, 25). However, these\nmechanisms do not seem to be suf\ufb01cient, because the level of\nclass 1 synthesis in cells replicating EBV is much lower than\nthat in noninduced control Akata cells, which have not re-\nceived an activating signal and do not express LMP1. Other\nmechanisms may be at play in inhibiting basic transcription of\nMHC class 1 molecules and potentially include BZLF1-depen-\ndent inhibition of transcription factors such as CREB and TBP\n(1, 23), as well as inhibition of nuclear export of spliced cellular\nmRNAs by BMLF1 (4, 33). Regardless of the speci\ufb01c molec-\nular event(s) involved in this phenomenon, our data strongly\nsuggest that virus-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis\nthrough reduction of mRNA expression is the major mecha-\nnism of MHC class 1 downregulation during the EBV lytic\ncycle.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS 1 DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1399\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by grants awarded to V.L. by the Swedish\nCancer Society, Swedish Children Cancer Foundation, and 1RIS Cen-\nter of the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research.\nWe thank Lindsey Hutt-Fletcher (Louisiana State University,\nShreveport, LA) for providing us with the recombinant EBV strain and\nEBV-infected cell lines.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Here we show that in several cell lines infected with a\nrecombinant EBV strain encoding green \ufb02uorescent protein (GFP), the virus lytic cycle coincides with GFP\nexpression, which thus can be used as a marker of virus replication. EBV replication resulted in downregu-\nlation of MHC class II and all classical MHC class I alleles independently of viral DNA synthesis or late gene\nexpression. Although assembled MHC class I complexes, the total pool of heavy chains, and \u00012-microglobulin\n(\u00012m) were signi\ufb01cantly downregulated, free class I heavy chains were stabilized at the surface of cells\nreplicating EBV. Calnexin expression was increased in GFP\u0002 cells, and calnexin and calreticulin accumulated\nat the cell surface that could contribute to the stabilization of class I heavy chains. Decreased expression levels\nof another chaperone, ERp57, and TAP2, a transporter associated with antigen processing and presentation,\ncorrelated with delayed kinetics of MHC class I maturation. Levels of both class I heavy chain and \u00012m mRNA\nwere reduced, and metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated a very low rate of class I heavy chain synthesis\nin lytically infected cells. MHC class I and MHC class II downregulation was mimicked by pharmacological\ninhibition of protein synthesis in latently infected cells. Our data suggest that although several mechanisms\nmay contribute to MHC class I downregulation in the course of EBV replication, inhibition of MHC class I\nsynthesis plays the primary role in the process.\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human gammaherpesvirus,\nwhich causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with a\nnumber of malignancies arising from B cells, epithelial cells,\nand other cell lineages. EBV establishes latent infection pre-\ndominantly, if not exclusively, in B lymphocytes, but virus rep-\nlication can occur in both B lymphocytes and epithelial cells of\nthe oropharynx. In the course of virus replication, approxi-\nmately 70 lytic cycle proteins are expressed in EBV-infected\ncells in three temporal stages: immediate early (IE), early, and\nlate. Entry into the lytic cycle is triggered by expression of\neither of the two IE genes BZLF1 and BRLF1. Both the\nBZLF1 and BRLF1 proteins function as transcriptional acti-\nvators and initiate the ordered cascade of viral lytic gene\nexpression culminating in the release of infectious virus (re-\nviewed in reference 18).\nThe majority of EBV carriers mount strong cytotoxic T-\nlymphocyte (CTL) responses speci\ufb01c to EBV lytic cycle anti-\ngens (5, 6, 15). EBV-speci\ufb01c CTLs appear to play the most\nimportant role in the immunological control of EBV replica-\ntion and EBV-induced malignant transformation. CTLs recog-\nnize their target cells through major histocompatibility com-\nplex (MHC) class I molecules loaded with antigen-derived\npeptides. Peptide ligands are generated in the cytosol by the\nproteolytic action of the proteasome and trimming peptidases\nand then translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by\nheterodimeric transporters associated with antigen presenta-\ntion 1 and 2 (TAP1 and TAP2). In the ER, MHC class I heavy\nchains interact with the chaperone calnexin, followed by inter-\naction with the chaperones calreticulin, ERp57, and \u00022-micro-\nglobulin (\u00022m) and a preformed complex of TAPs and tapasin.\nThis peptide loading complex is essential for ef\ufb01cient assembly\nof MHC class I complexes and their egress from the ER\nthrough the Golgi to the cell surface (reviewed in reference 8).\nTo escape from CD8\u0001 T-cell recognition and destruction, vi-\nruses have developed strategies to inhibit the expression of MHC\nclass I. These mechanisms include transcriptional downregulation\nof the heavy chain expression, interference with antigen process-\ning by the proteasome, blocking of peptide transport into the ER,\ndislocation of MHC class I heavy chains from the ER to the\ncytosol for subsequent degradation, retention of MHC class I in\nthe ER, and targeted degradation of class I from post-ER com-\npartments. Several of these strategies for herpes simplex virus,\nvaricella-zoster virus, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus,\nand most notably cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been dissected\nin detail previously (reviewed in references 19 and 36).\nEBV replication also results in downregulation of MHC\nclass I molecules at the surface of infected cells.

Previous\nstudies have shown that in lymphoblastoid cell lines, the EBV\nlytic cycle and MHC class I downregulation are paralleled by\ndownregulation of MHC class II, CD40, and CD54 while\nCD19, CD80, and CD86 are not affected, pointing to a possible\nspeci\ufb01city of the process (16). Reduction of MHC class I ex-\npression was found to be an early lytic cycle event that was not\ndependent on viral DNA replication. The immediate-early\nBZLF1 protein was implicated in MHC class I downregulation\nin lymphoblastoid cell lines through inhibition of latent mem-\nbrane protein 1 (LMP1), which upregulates MHC class I ex-\npression in cells latently infected by EBV and is also expressed\nthroughout the lytic cycle. A more ef\ufb01cient system has been\ndeveloped recently to study EBV replication based on trans-\nfection of EBV-positive Akata cells with a reporter which is\nexpressed during the lytic cycle, allowing identi\ufb01cation and\nisolation of cells supporting virus replication from those in\nlatency (29). Experiments performed with this model revealed\nthat the capacity of the TAP1/TAP2 heterodimer to translo-\ncate peptides into the ER is inhibited by up to 70% during\nEBV replication, and because the expression of MHC class I\nheavy chains was found to be unaltered, it was suggested that\nthis mechanism plays the primary role in downregulation of\nMHC class I molecules in the course of EBV replication (29).\nIn this study, we made use of a similar model based on a\nrecombinant Akata virus carrying a cassette expressing green\n\ufb02uorescent protein (GFP) and the neomycin resistance gene\ninserted into the open reading frame of the nonessential thy-\nmidine kinase gene (34). We show that in these cells, the GFP\ngene is expressed during the lytic cycle with kinetics similar to\nthose of the early EBV lytic genes. Thus, cells expressing GFP\ncan be identi\ufb01ed, separated, and used for immunological or\nbiochemical analysis of changes caused by virus replication in\nEBV-infected cells. Our results show that even though multi-\nple mechanisms might operate during EBV lytic replication,\ninhibition of MHC class I heavy chains and \u00022m synthesis is\none of the key mechanisms of EBV-induced MHC class I\ndownregulation.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell lines and induction of EBV replication. The Bx1g variants of the Burkitt\u2019s\nlymphoma cell line Akata (Akata Bx1g), the gastric carcinoma cell line AGS\n(AGS Bx1g), and the colorectal epithelial carcinoma cell line HCT116 (HCT116\nBx1g) were obtained by the infection of EBV-negative Akata, AGS, and HCT116\ncells with a recombinant virus originated from the EBV strain derived from the\nwild-type Akata cells. The recombinant virus was generated by introducing a\ncassette containing the neomycin resistance gene under the control of a thymi-\ndine kinase promoter and a modi\ufb01ed GFP gene under the control of the imme-\ndiate-early cytomegalovirus promoter into the open reading frame of the non-\nessential thymidine kinase gene (refer to reference 24 for more details on the\ngeneration of the virus). The Bx1g cell variants were grown in medium supple-\nmented with 500 \u0003g/ml of Geneticin sulfate (G418; Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis,\nMO). In Akata Bx1g cells, the EBV lytic cycle was induced by culturing in the\npresence of 50 \u0003g/ml goat F(ab\u0004)2 fragments speci\ufb01c to human immunoglobulin\nG (IgG; MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) for the indicated periods of time. The\nlytic cycle in AGS Bx1g and HCT116 Bx1g cells was induced by culturing for 24 h\nwith 30 ng/ml of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma Aldrich)\nand 0.5 mM sodium butyrate (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The chemicals were\nthen removed, and the culturing was continued for the indicated periods of time.\nAll cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with L-glutamine and 10%\nfetal calf serum.\nTo inhibit viral DNA replication and late lytic cycle gene expression or to block\nprotein synthesis, cells were cultured in the presence of 0.2 mM acyclovir\n(Alpharma, Oslo, Norway) or 50 \u0003g/ml cycloheximide (Sigma Aldrich), respectively.\nAntibodies. BZ.1 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) is a monoclonal antibody\n(MAb) speci\ufb01c to the immediate-early BZLF1 protein of EBV. 85K and 2L10\nare MAbs speci\ufb01c to the p85 early antigen of EBV and to the late envelope\nglycoprotein gp350/220, respectively. W6/32 (HB95; ATCC) is a pan-MHC class\nI-speci\ufb01c MAb which recognizes heavy chains associated with \u00022m. r\u0005HC (rabbit\nanti-heavy chain) is a rabbit antiserum that recognizes free heavy chains of MHC\nclass I molecules encoded by the human leukocyte antigen A (HLA-A), B, or C\nlocus (32) and HC10 is a MAb that binds to a linear epitope exposed on free\nheavy chains of the HLA-B and -C loci (32). Both Abs were a kind gift of Hidde\nPloegh (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The anti-HLA-A (clone 108-\n2C5) and -HLA-B (clone Joan-1) MAbs were both from Lab Vision (Fremont,\nCA). The L31 Ab recognizes a linear \u00051 domain epitope exposed on free heavy\nchains of HLA-C (a kind gift of Louise Berg, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm,\nSweden). Abs speci\ufb01c to ERp57 or calreticulin (both from StressGen, Victoria,\nCanada), calnexin (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), or tapasin (BD Bio-\nsciences) were used for both \ufb02ow cytometry and immunoblotting. Abs speci\ufb01c to\n\u00022m, clone TU\n\u00a8 99 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and TAP1 or TAP2 (BD\nBiosciences), as well as \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Ab against MHC\nclass I, MHC class II, CD19, and CD86 (all from BD Biosciences) were used for\n\ufb02ow cytometry. Rabbit antiserum speci\ufb01c to \u00022m (Dako), Abs against the pro-\nteasomal subunits LMP2, LMP7, MECL1 (monoclonal antibodies), and \u00053 (rab-\nbit polyclonal) (Af\ufb01nity Research, Plymouth Meeting, PA) as well as GFP-\nspeci\ufb01c Ab (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) or actin-speci\ufb01c Ab (Sigma Aldrich) were\nused only for immunoblotting. The tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII)-speci\ufb01c MAb\nwas from Immunesystem (Uppsala, Sweden). The TAP1- and TAP2-speci\ufb01c Abs\nused in immunoblotting were a kind gift from John Trowsdale (Cambridge\nInstitute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom). All antibody\npreparations used as isotype controls for \ufb02ow cytometry were purchased from\neither Dako or BD Biosciences. The goat anti-mouse allophycocyanin (APC)-\nconjugated antibody for indirect immunostaining was purchased from BD Bio-\nsciences. The relevant secondary antibodies for immunoblotting were purchased\nform Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden).\nFlow cytometry. At the indicated time points after induction, Akata Bx1g, AGS\nBx1g, or HCT116 Bx1g cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS), \ufb01xed for 25 min in Cyto\ufb01x/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences), washed three\ntimes in Perm/Wash solution (BD Biosciences), and blocked for 30 min on ice\nwith serum from an EBV-negative individual (5% in PBS). Samples were then\nincubated for 30 min on ice with primary unconjugated Abs, washed, and incu-\nbated with goat anti-mouse APC-conjugated Ab for an additional 30 min on ice.\nAll acquisitions were performed on a FACScalibur \ufb02ow cytometer and analyzed\nusing CellQuest (BD Biosciences). Double stainings were performed by labeling\ncells \ufb01rst with unconjugated BZLF1-speci\ufb01c Ab, whose binding was revealed by\nstaining with a relevant anti-mouse conjugate, as described above, followed by\nstaining with MHC class I-, class II-, CD19-, or CD86-speci\ufb01c directly conjugated\nAb. Staining for HLA-C with L31 Ab, which recognizes free HLA-C heavy\nchains, was performed after the cells were treated for 2 min with a low-pH buffer\n(0.131 M citric acid, 0.066 M Na2HPO4, pH 3.3) to elute the peptides and\ndissociate the heavy chain from \u00022m.\nAnalysis of protein expression by immunoblotting. Akata Bx1g cells were\ninduced with IgG-speci\ufb01c Abs for either 24 or 48 h and then sorted using a\nMoFlo sorter (Dako Cytomation) into GFP\u0001 and GFP\u0006 cells. 7AAD (BD\nBiosciences) was used to exclude dead cells during sorting. Cells were counted\nand pelleted, and the same numbers of GFP-positive cells and GFP-negative\ncells were lysed in reducing electrophoresis sample buffer (1 \u0007 106 cells/100 \u0003l).\nElectrophoresis was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gels or 8 to 16% poly-\nduramide gradient gels (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) and proteins were\ntransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Mem-\nbranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% skimmed milk and probed with\ndifferent primary Abs followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to horserad-\nish peroxidase. The signal was detected using Super Signal chemiluminescence\ndetection solution (Pierce, Rockford, IL), and images were acquired on a LAS-\n3000 luminescent image analyzer (Fuji\ufb01lm Medical Systems, Stamford, CT).\nPulse-chase experiments, immunoprecipitation and MHC class I maturation.\nLytic cycle was induced in Akata Bx1g cells for 24 or 48 h, which were then sorted\ninto GFP\u0001 (lytic) and GFP\u0006 (latent), as described above. For metabolic labeling,\n2 \u0007 106 cells/sample were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, spun down, and resuspended in fresh\nprewarmed methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco\u2019s modi\ufb01ed Eagle\u2019s medium\n(DMEM) with 150 \u0003Ci of [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine (Redivue Pro-mix\nL-[35S] in vitro cell labeling mix; Amersham) and cultured for 2 h at 37\u00b0C.\nFor short pulse-chase experiments, cells were labeled for 2 min with 400 \u0003Ci\nRedivue Pro-mix. Labeling was terminated by the addition of nonradioactive\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS I DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1391\n\nL-methionine and L-cysteine (1 mM) (Sigma), and samples were pelleted and\nfrozen at time zero or at 5 and 30 min of chase.\nTo assess the role of protein degradation, cells were incubated in methionine-\nand cysteine-free DMEM at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of the proteasomal\ninhibitor lactacystine (10 \u0003M) and the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (4 \u0003M)\n(Sigma). Cells were labeled for 20 min with 400 \u0003Ci Redivue Pro-mix, washed,\nand then pelleted.\nFor the assessment of MHC class I maturation, cells were pulsed for 30 min,\nlabeling was terminated as described above, cells were washed once and reincu-\nbated in prewarmed DMEM containing excess unlabeled L-methionine and L-\ncysteine and 10% fetal calf serum. Samples were collected immediately after the\npulse (time zero) and at 1 h and 2 h of chase.\nSamples were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1\nmM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \ufb02uoride) on ice. After\n30 min, nuclei were removed by centrifugation (relative centrifugal force, 3,000;\n10 min). MHC class I molecules were immunoprecipitated with either W6/32 or\nr\u0005HC Abs after preclearing with mouse or rabbit serum, respectively.\nFor endo-\u0002-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endoH) digestion, immune com-\nplexes bound to protein A Sepharose beads were eluted by incubation at 95\u00b0C for\n5 min in elution buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate, 3 mM EDTA, 0.25% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate [SDS], pH 6.0). One half of each sample was digested overnight\nat 37\u00b0C with 2 mU endoH (Roche, Mamheim, Germany), and the other half was\nmock digested. Samples were mixed with reducing electrophoresis loading buffer\nand analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on a 10%\npolyacrylamide gel. Gels were \ufb01xed (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 5% glyc-\nerol), vacuum dried, and incubated in a Hypercassette (Amersham), and the\nsignal was revealed in a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, GE\nHealthcare).\nReal-time RT-PCR (RNA preparation and reverse transcription). After in-\nduction of the lytic cycle, Akata Bx1g cells were sorted into GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001\npopulations, carefully counted, and RNA was extracted from 1 \u0007 106 cells of\neach population according to the instructions of the QIAGEN RNA blood\nminikit (Hilden, Germany). RNA was eluted with 30 \u0003l of RNase-free water.\nThe cDNA synthesis was performed in a total volume of 50 \u0003l containing 30 \u0003l\nRNA, 1 \u0007 \ufb01rst-strand buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM\nMgCl2), 105 \u0003g/ml pdN6 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), 1 mM of each\ndeoxynucleoside triphosphate (Amersham Biosciences), 1 mM dithiothreitol,\n0.48 units/\u0003l RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), and 4.8 units/\u0003l Moloney murine\nleukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT; Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland), at 37\u00b0C\nfor 1.5 h. The reaction was stopped by heating at 68\u00b0C for 15 min.\nReal-time PCR. A total of 2.5 \u0003l of cDNA was used in a 25-\u0003l reaction mixture\ncontaining 1\u0007 SYBR green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 300 nM\nof each primer. Primers and primer sequences were as follows: HLA class I-F,\n5\u0004-ACC TGG AGA ACG GGA AGG A-3\u0004; HLA class I-R, 5\u0004-TGT GAT CTC\nCGC AGG GTA GAA-3\u0004; \u00022m-F, 5\u0004-GAT GAG TAT GCC TGC CGT GTG-3\u0004;\n\u00022m-R, 5\u0004-CAA TCC AAA TGC GGC ATC T-3\u0004; G6PD-F, 5\u0004-TGC CCC CGA\nCCG TCT AC-3\u0004; G6PD-R, 5\u0004-ATG CGG TTC CAG CCT ATC TG-3\u0004; ABL-F,\n5\u0004-CGA AGG GAG GGT GTA CCA TTA C-3\u0004; ABL-R, 5\u0004-CGT TGA ATG\nATG ATG AAC CAA CTC-3\u0004. The PCR was performed and analyzed on the\nABI 7000 sequence detection system with the following PCR conditions: 50\u00b0C for\n2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 PCR ampli\ufb01cation cycles with 95\u00b0C for\n15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Relative quanti\ufb01cation of gene expression was calculated\naccording to the Delta-Delta CT method. The formula used was 2\b\tCT\n, where \tCT\nequals the cycle threshold (CT) of a given gene in GFP\u0001 cells minus the CT of the\nsame gene in GFP\u0006 cells.\nRESULTS\nAn alternative model for EBV lytic replication. Analysis of\nEBV lytic replication has been hampered by the lack of suit-\nable permissive systems of virus infection. Recently, Ressing et\nal. described a new experimental model of EBV replication\nbased on transfection of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma Akata cells with a\nplasmid encoding the rat CD2 extracellular and transmem-\nbrane domains, with the cytosolic domain replaced with GFP\n(29). Expression of the fusion protein in this construct is driven\nby the BMRF1 early gene promoter. Upon induction of the\nlytic cycle by cross-linking of surface immunoglobulins, trans-\nfected cells supporting virus replication could be either studied\nbased on their GFP expression or isolated with anti-rat CD2\nbeads (29).\nWe made use of an alternative system in which a cassette\nencoding the GFP gene under control of the CMV immediate-\nearly promoter was inserted into the open reading frame of the\nnonessential thymidine kinase gene of the wild-type Akata\nvirus (34). This recombinant virus was used to infect an EBV-\nnegative variant of the Akata cell line, the gastric carcinoma\ncell line AGS, and the colorectal epithelial carcinoma cell line\nHCT116, generating EBV-positive cell lines referred to as\nAkata Bx1g, AGS Bx1g, and HCT116 Bx1g, respectively.\nCultures of cells infected with the recombinant virus typi-\ncally contained a small population of cells in lytic replication\n(Fig. 1A, upper panels; data not shown for HCT116 Bx1g\ncells). In Akata Bx1g cells, the expression of the immediate-\nearly gene BZLF1 quite strictly coincided with expression of\nGFP, whereas both GFP single-positive and GFP/BZLF1 dou-\nble-positive populations could be clearly distinguished in AGS\nBx1g cells and HCT116 Bx1g cells before and after induction\nof the lytic cycle. This probably re\ufb02ects the higher steady-state\nactivity of the CMV promoter in epithelial cells. Upon induc-\ntion of the lytic cycle by surface IgG cross-linking or TPA and\nsodium butyrate, the proportions of Akata Bx1g and AGS\nBx1g cells replicating EBV increased from approximately 2%\nto 40% and from 3% to 10%, respectively.\nIn accordance with previous reports, cells supporting lytic\nreplication expressed decreased surface levels of MHC class I\n(Fig. 1A, lower panels, and B) and MHC class II (Fig. 1C).\nInduction of the virus lytic cycle increased the number of cells\nwith low levels of surface MHC class I in Akata Bx1g, AGS\nBx1g (Fig. 1A and B, lower panels), and HCT116 Bx1g (data\nnot shown) cells, although the kinetics of this process was\nslower in the epithelial cells, with visible increase of the GFP/\nBZLF1 double-positive population only 48 h posttreatment\nand onwards. In our experimental model, Ig cross-linking or\nTPA-sodium butyrate treatment led to an increase in MHC\nclass I expression on the surface of cells that remained in\nlatency compared to that on control untreated cells (Fig. 1B,\nupper panels). This observation contrasts with the \ufb01ndings of\nRessing et al., who observed no difference in MHC class I\nexpression between anti-Ig-treated and untreated cells latently\ninfected with the virus (29). Therefore, in all experiments, we\ncompared GFP\u0001 cells replicating the virus with the GFP\u0006\npopulation within the same cultures exposed to lytic cycle-\ninducing stimuli.\nTo exclude the possibility that the observed effect of virus\nreplication on MHC class I expression was caused by the ex-\npression of GFP or other unknown effects mediated by the\nrecombinant virus, wild-type Akata cells were induced to rep-\nlicate EBV and then costained with the BZLF1-speci\ufb01c anti-\nbody and one of the antibodies speci\ufb01c to MHC class I, MHC\nclass II, CD19, or CD86 (Fig. 1C). As previously reported,\nsurface expression of CD19 and CD86 remained unchanged,\nwhereas levels of MHC class I and II were decreased in cells\nreplicating the virus. All classical MHC class I alleles were\ndownregulated by approximately 60% on average in lytically\ninfected Akata Bx1g cells as revealed by staining with antibod-\nies that recognize pan-HLA-A, pan-HLA-B, or pan-HLA-C\n(Fig. 1D).\nTo get an insight into the role of different EBV proteins in\n1392\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nFIG. 1. EBV lytic replication results in GFP expression and MHC class I downregulation in Akata Bx1g and AGS Bx1g cells. Akata cells\ncarrying a recombinant EBV strain with the GFP gene inserted under the immediate-early CMV promoter into the virus genome (Akata Bx1g\ncells) or AGS gastric epithelial cells infected with the same virus (AGS Bx1g cells) were treated as described in Materials and Methods to induce\nthe EBV lytic cycle. Staining with the indicated speci\ufb01c antibodies and \ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis were performed as\ndescribed in Materials and Methods. A. EBV replication, GFP expression, and MHC class I downregulation coincide in Akata Bx1g and AGS Bx1g\ncells. To induce EBV replication, cells were cultured either with F(ab\u0004)2 fragments speci\ufb01c to human IgG for the indicated periods of time (Akata\nBx1g) or with TPA and sodium butyrate (AGS Bx1g) for 24 h, washed, and incubated in standard culture medium for the remaining time of\ninduction. The four upper panels show intracellular staining for BZLF1. The lower panels show surface staining for MHC class I using W6/32\nantibody. In both cases, anti-mouse APC-conjugated antibody was used to detect binding of primary antibodies. The R1 and R2 regions in the\nlower panels de\ufb01ne two different cell populations, GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells, respectively, that were used for FACS analysis and cell sorting in this\nand all subsequent experiments. B. Signals used to activate the EBV lytic cycle in Akata or AGS cells induce overall upregulation of MHC class\nI, which is overridden by virus replication. Surface staining for MHC class I was done with W6/32 antibody and APC-conjugated anti-mouse\nsecondary antibody. The upper panel shows the expression of MHC class I in the total population of either control (noninduced) or anti-IgG-\ntreated (Akata-induced) or TPA-butyrate-treated (AGS-induced) cells. The four lower panels show either control or induced cells, each divided\ninto GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 populations. The histograms are presented to illustrate the distribution of cells with different levels of MHC class I\nexpression in cultures replicating the virus. C. Wild-type Akata cells downregulate MHC class I and MHC class II molecules upon induction of\nthe EBV lytic cycle. Wild-type EBV-positive Akata cells were incubated with F(ab\u0004)2 fragments speci\ufb01c to human IgG for 24 h. Indirect\nintracellular staining for BZLF1 was followed by staining with directly conjugated MHC class I-, class II-, CD19-, or CD86-speci\ufb01c antibody. Cells\nwere gated as BZLF1 positive (pos) or BZLF1 negative (neg). The geometric means of \ufb02uorescence intensities (Geo MFI) of the gated populations\nare shown. D. HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles are downregulated to similar extents during EBV replication. At 24 h after induction, the levels of surface\nexpression of classical MHC class I molecules were assessed in Akata Bx1g cells with either a pan-MHC class I-speci\ufb01c antibody (W6/32) or\nantibodies speci\ufb01cally recognizing HLA-A, -B, or -C alleles. The geometric means of \ufb02uorescence intensity obtained with each of the indicated\nantibodies for GFP-positive cells are shown as percentages relative to those of anti-IgG-treated GFP-negative (latent) cells (the means and\nstandard deviations of three experiments).\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS I DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1393\n\nthe downregulation of MHC class I expression, we \ufb01rst as-\nsessed the kinetics of this process in relation to the kinetics of\nexpression of immediate-early, early or late EBV proteins fol-\nlowing induction of the lytic cycle. The immediate-early gene\nBZLF1 was already expressed after 6 h of induction of the\nlytic cycle in Akata Bx1g cells (Fig. 2). Early gene expres-\nsion, assessed by staining for the EA-R protein, was unde-\ntectable at 6 h but picked up at 12 h, when virtually all cells\nexpressing immediate-early genes also expressed early genes\n(Fig. 2A). At this time point, a small proportion of cells\nalready expressed late genes, as assessed by staining for the\nenvelope glycoprotein gp350/220, but late gene expression\nby the majority of GFP\u0001 cells was seen only at 24 h. The\npercentage of cells that express lytic cycle genes peaked at\n24 h, followed by a decrease at 48 h, which could be due to\ncell death as a result of lytic replication. Surface MHC class\nI was slightly upregulated at 6 h postinduction in cells that\nexpressed BZLF1 in comparison to cells that were subjected\nto anti-Ig treatment but remained in latency. This upregu-\nlation was quickly reverted, and by 12 h, MHC class I was\nreduced by 20%; the extent of downregulation continued to\nincrease, reaching its peak at 48 h. The degree of downregu-\nlation varied between individual experiments but averaged\n60% by 48 h.\nThe fact that the surface levels of MHC class I were already\ndecreased by 12 h postinduction, as well as the fact that as-\nsembled molecules should have an average half-life of 6 to 8 h,\nsuggested that MHC class I downregulation is induced by an\nimmediate-early or early EBV proteins. In agreement with this\nassumption and previously published data (16), acyclovir\ngreatly decreased late gene expression in induced Akata cells\nand reduced percentages of cells expressing BZLF1 but did not\nsigni\ufb01cantly affect the levels of BZLF1 expression and MHC\nclass I downregulation in BZLF1-positive cells (Fig. 2B).\nFIG. 2. MHC class I downregulation is independent of virus DNA replication. A. MHC class I downregulation is an early event in the virus\nlytic cycle. The lytic cycle was induced in Akata Bx1g cells by IgG cross-linking, and the levels of expression of immediate-early (BZLF1), early\n(EA-R-p85), and late (gp350/220) lytic cycle antigens were assessed by intracellular staining. In parallel, surface MHC class I was detected at each\ntime point after induction. Percentages of cells positive for each of the antigens at the indicated time points are shown on the left y axis, whereas\nthe relative MHC class I downregulation in GFP-positive cells compared with the GFP-negative cells is shown on the right y axis. B. MHC class\nI downregulation is independent of virus DNA replication and late gene expression. Akata Bx1g cells were induced by IgG cross-linking in the\npresence or absence of 0.2 mM acyclovir. At the indicated time points, cells were collected and stained for intracellular BZLF1 or gp350/220\nexpression. The numbers inside the dot plots indicate percentages of cells in the relevant quadrants. Mean \ufb02uorescence intensity of BZLF1-speci\ufb01c\nstaining is shown for cells positive for both GFP and BZLF1. In parallel, samples were also stained for surface MHC class I, and the percentage\nof MHC class I downregulation was assessed as described above. The results of this analysis are shown on the graph.\n1394\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ.

To understand the fate of MHC class I in\ncells replicating EBV, we \ufb01rst asked whether the surface down-\nregulation of assembled molecules re\ufb02ected the overall de-\ncrease of heavy chain expression in these cells. Akata Bx1g\ncells were sorted into GFP\u0006 (latent) and GFP\u0001 (lytic) popu-\nlations at 48 h after induction. Western blot analysis of total\ncell lysates showed that lytic replication reduces the expression\nof MHC class I heavy chains as detected by two different heavy\nchain-speci\ufb01c antibodies (Fig. 3A). Levels of \u00022m were also\nstrongly reduced. In accordance with downregulation of assem-\nbled MHC class I at the cell surface (Fig. 1), cells subjected to\nsurface IgG cross-linking but remaining in latency (GFP\u0006)\nexpressed slightly increased amounts of heavy chains in total\ncell lysates compared to noninduced controls (Fig. 4A). Cells\nin the lytic cycle had reduced levels of total heavy chains in\nFIG. 3. Free heavy chains accumulate during lytic replication.

B.

N.D., not detected.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS I DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1395\n\ncomparison to either noninduced or induced but latently in-\nfected cells.\nNext, we studied the expression of assembled MHC class I,\nfree heavy chains, and \u00022m both at the cell surface and in\npermeabilized cells, the latter re\ufb02ecting the total pool of the\nanalyzed molecules. The density plots in Fig. 3B show a typical\nsurface staining for these molecules at 48 h postinduction.\nBoth assembled MHC class I and \u00022m were decreased in\npermeabilized cells and on the surface of GFP\u0001 cells com-\npared to GFP\u0006 cells at 24 h postinduction, and this downregu-\nlation became more pronounced at 48 h (Fig. 3B). In contrast,\nthe levels of free heavy chain, detected by the MAb HC10,\nwere unchanged at 24 h and tended to increase at 48 h in lytic\ncells compared to those in cells in latency. Also, downregula-\ntion of \u00022m at the cell surface was statistically more signi\ufb01cant\n(P value in nonpaired t test, 0.01) than that of assembled MHC\nclass I after 48 h of lytic cycle induction. A stronger downregu-\nlation of \u00022m was also revealed upon staining of permeabilized\ncells after 24 h of induction (P value, 0.002). Taken together,\nthese results reveal that during EBV replication, expression\nlevels of both heavy chains and \u00022m are downregulated, and\n\u00022m seems to be reduced to a greater extent. At the same time,\nboth the total pool and surface fraction of free heavy chains are\nincreased, suggesting that free heavy chains selectively accu-\nmulate at the surface of cells supporting the lytic cycle.\nProteins that aid the generation of folded and peptide-\nloaded MHC class I are modulated during EBV lytic replica-\ntion. To investigate whether other mechanisms, in addition to\ndecreased expression of heavy chains and \u00022m, contribute to\nMHC class I downregulation in lytically infected cells, expres-\nsion of several components of the MHC class I processing\npathway in GFP\u0001 and GFP\u0006 Akata Bx1g cells was analyzed by\nimmunoblotting. GFP\u0006 cells were always negative for BZLF1\nexpression regardless of the time period between induction of\nthe lytic cycle and cell sorting (24 or 48 h). No signi\ufb01cant\nchanges could be observed in the expression of LMP2, LMP7,\nand MECL-1 subunits of the immunoproteasome (Fig. 4A),\nnor was there a change in the expression of the nonproteolytic\nconstitutive \u00053 proteasomal subunit. TPPII, another cytosolic\npeptidase implicated in the generation of MHC class I peptide\nepitopes, was slightly downregulated.\nTo compare the expression levels of peptide transporters\nand ER chaperones that play a role in the assembly and pep-\ntide loading of MHC class I, both immunoblotting and \ufb02ow\ncytometry analysis of protein expression at the cell surface and\nin permeabilized cells were used as described for Fig. 3 and in\nMaterials and Methods. Signi\ufb01cant accumulation of calnexin\nwas observed mostly in the intracellular compartments of cells\nin the lytic cycle after 24 h of induction. In contrast, calreticulin\naccumulated on the surface, while its overall expression was\nreduced by up to 50% (Fig. 4). Expression of the chaperone\nERp57 showed a general reduction. Tapasin, TAP1, and TAP2\ncould not be detected at the cell surface by \ufb02ow cytometry, and\ntheir overall levels were not modulated signi\ufb01cantly, as de-\ntected by immunoblotting, with the exception of TAP2, whose\nexpression was decreased by approximately 30% (Fig. 4).\nMHC class I synthesis is reduced during lytic replication.\nHerpesviruses target MHC class I molecules for degradation\nthrough a number of mechanisms (31). Therefore, we investi-\ngated whether the decrease of MHC class I heavy chain ex-\npression in the course of EBV replication is due to inhibition\nof heavy chain synthesis or targeted protein degradation. In-\nduced and sorted Akata Bx1g cells were labeled with [35S]me-\nthionine and [35S]cysteine, and their lysates were immunopre-\ncipitated with W6/32 or r\u0005\u000bC antibodies speci\ufb01c to assembled\nMHC class I or free heavy chains, respectively. After 2 h of\nlabeling, most labeled heavy chains were associated with \u00022m\nand recovered with W6/32 antibody from control cells (Fig.\n5A). Comparison of GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells revealed a drastic\nreduction in 35S-labeled W6/32- and r\u0005HC-reactive molecules\nin cells replicating the virus. The amount of de novo-synthe-\nsized MHC class I molecules was strongly reduced, by approx-\nimately 85% in GFP\u0001 cells. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation\nof [35S]methionine-labeled cellular proteins revealed that cells\nin the lytic cycle incorporated the amino acid at 25% of the\nlevel of GFP\u0006 cells in latency (data not shown). This is con-\nsistent with overall inhibition of protein synthesis in cells rep-\nlicating the virus. However, heavy chain downregulation ob-\nserved by immunoblotting of total lysates of the same cells was\nrelatively moderate, reaching only about 40% reduction in\nband intensity (Fig. 5B).\nThese results could re\ufb02ect two non-mutually exclusive sce-\nnarios, that heavy chains are synthesized at a low rate or newly\nmade molecules are rapidly degraded. To address this ques-\ntion, we performed pulse-chase experiments on sorted cell\npopulations, in which cells were metabolically labeled for 2 min\nand chased immediately at time zero or 5 or 30 min postlabel-\ning. The cell lysates were sequentially immunoprecipitated\nwith W6/32 and r\u0005HC antibodies (Fig. 5C). In cells infected\nwith EBV latently, r\u0005HC-reactive molecules were visible at\ntime zero and their intensity decreased at the subsequent time\npoints, whereas the amount of assembled, W6/32-reactive\nMHC class I molecules increased over time. However, both\nW6/32- and r\u0005HC-reactive molecules were practically unde-\ntectable in cells replicating the virus, supporting the notion that\nthe rate of MHC class I synthesis is low during the EBV lytic\ncycle. This experiment still did not rule out completely the\npossibility that heavy chains are synthesized but degraded im-\nmediately. Therefore, we pretreated cells with a combination\nof lactacystin, a speci\ufb01c inhibitor of the proteasome, and chlo-\nroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation, and then per-\nformed metabolic labeling and sequential immunoprecipita-\ntion as described above (Fig. 5D). Immunoprecipitation of\nlysates of GFP\u0006 cells with the W6/32 and r\u0005HC antibodies\nshowed an accumulation of relevant protein moieties in cells\npretreated with the inhibitors. In contrast, neither W6/32- nor\nr\u0005HC-reactive species were revealed in cells replicating EBV\neven upon inhibition of protein degradation. Immunoprecipi-\ntation of \u00022m also performed in this series of experiments\ndemonstrated that its synthesis was inhibited in GFP\u0001 cells to\nan extent comparable to that observed for MHC class I heavy\nchains (data not shown).\nTo investigate whether decreased transcription/increased\nturnover of mRNA contributes to the decrease of MHC class\nI heavy chain synthesis, the abundance of mRNA message for\nthe classical MHC class I molecules and \u00022m was determined\nusing real-time RT-PCR analysis.

VIROL.\n\nFIG. 5. Reduced synthesis of MHC class I is associated with inhibition of transcription during lytic replication. Akata Bx1g cells were induced\nwith anti-IgG for either 48 h (A and B) or 24 h (C, D, E, F, and G) and then sorted into GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 populations. Both populations were\nincubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM prior to metabolic labeling. The bands shown in all experiments correspond\nto the heavy chain of MHC class I (\f45 kDa). A. Synthesis of MHC class I heavy chains is inhibited during EBV replication. Cells were\nmetabolically labeled for 2 h as described in Materials and Methods and immunoprecipitated with W6/32 or r\u0005HC antibody. Samples were\nseparated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography of dried gels was performed using a PhosphorImager. B. The levels of newly synthesized MHC class\nI heavy chains are reduced during lytic replication. Equal numbers of GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells were either lysed directly in SDS-containing lysis buffer\nor labeled with [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine mix for 2 h and immunoprecipitated with W6/32 as described above. Total cell lysates (TCL) were\nseparated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose \ufb01lters, and probed for the heavy chain and actin speci\ufb01c antibody as a loading control.\nC. Rapid degradation does not appear to account for the decreased levels of newly synthesized heavy chains. Cells were labeled with [35S]me-\nthionine-[35S]cysteine mix for 2 min and incorporation of radioactivity was terminated by the addition of 1 mM of nonradioactive L-methionine\nand L-cysteine. Samples were pelleted and frozen either immediately (time zero) or after 5 and 30 min of chase, followed by sequential\nimmunoprecipitation with W6/32 and r\u0005HC antibody. Electrophoresis and autoradiography were performed as described above. D. Inhibitors of\nproteasomal or lysosomal degradation do not recover expression of newly synthesized heavy chains. Cells were incubated in methionine- and\ncysteine-free DMEM for 1 h in the presence of both proteasomal inhibitor lactacysin (10 \u0003M) and lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (4 \u0003M), labeled\nfor 20 min with 400 \u0003Ci [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine followed by sequential immunoprecipitation with W6/32 and r\u0005HC, electrophoresis, and\nautoradiography.

After sorting, GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells were\ncarefully counted and pellets of equal numbers of cells were used for reverse transcription and RT-PCR analysis of MHC class I and \u00022m mRNA.\nValues of relative expression of these mRNAs in GFP\u0001 relative to GFP\u0006 cells are shown. Means and standard deviations of three independent\nexperiments. F. Inhibition of protein synthesis mimics the effect of lytic replication on downregulation of assembled surface MHC class I and class\nII molecules. Akata Bx1g cells were either cultured in control medium, treated with 50 \u0003g/ml cycloheximide or induced into lytic cycle for 24 h\nand then stained for surface MHC class I and II. The expression levels of MHC class I and II on both GFP\u0001 and cycloheximide-treated cells are\nshown as percentages relative to those in GFP\u0006 or untreated cells, respectively. G. Assembled MHC class I molecules synthesized in lytically\ninfected cells are delayed in their maturation. Cells metabolically labeled for 30 min were incubated in prewarmed DMEM containing excesses of\nunlabeled L-methionine and L-cysteine and 10% fetal calf serum. Samples were collected immediately after the pulse (time zero) and at 1 h or 2 h\nof incubation. After immunoprecipitation with W6/32, assembled MHC class I was eluted from the Sepharose beads, digested by endoH (2 mM)\nand separated by SDS-PAGE together with nondigested controls. The line graph shows ratios between the intensities of endoH-resistant\nand -sensitive bands in GFP\u0001 and GFP\u0006 cells.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS I DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1397\n\nexpression levels could not be used to assess the abundance of\nMHC class I and \u00022m mRNAs. Instead, normalization was\nachieved by extracting mRNA from equal numbers of sorted\nGFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells. As shown in Fig. 5E, the mRNA mes-\nsage for MHC class I was reduced by an average of 70%,\nwhereas the \u00022m message was reduced by approximately 60%.\nTo test directly whether global inhibition of protein synthesis\ncan cause MHC class I downregulation in Akata Bx1g cells\nwithin the timeframe of experiments performed in this study,\ncells were either treated to induce the lytic cycle or incubated\nwith 50 \u0003g/ml of cycloheximide for 24 h (Fig. 5F). GFP\u0001 cells\nwere compared to anti-Ig-treated GFP\u0006 cells, while untreated\ncells served as a control for cycloheximide-treated cells. EBV\nreplication and inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide\nresulted in comparable reduction of MHC class I and class II\nexpression.\nInhibition of TAP-mediated peptide translocation into the\nER during EBV replication has been previously suggested\n(29). Our results revealed a slight inhibition of TAP2 expres-\nsion as well as downregulation of TPPII and ERp57 in cells\nreplicating the virus. All these changes could decrease the\nef\ufb01ciency of peptide supply and loading in lytically infected\ncells, thereby affecting the kinetics of MHC class I progression\nthrough the ER and Golgi apparatus. To assess the ef\ufb01ciency\nof this process, Akata Bx1g cells were induced, sorted, labeled\nfor 30 min with [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine, and chased at\nthe indicated time points after the pulse. After immunopre-\ncipitation with W6/32 antibodies, samples were divided and\neither mock treated or treated with endoH, an enzyme which\nremoves N-linked oligosaccharides attached to proteins in the\nER but does not trim modi\ufb01ed versions of these sugars ac-\nquired in the Golgi compartment. It has been previously dem-\nonstrated that the kinetics of MHC class I maturation is rela-\ntively slow in Akata cells due to their intrinsically low TAP\nactivity (10, 17). Accordingly, a proportion of MHC class I\nmolecules remained endoH sensitive even after 2 h of chase in\nthe control GFP-negative cells (Fig. 5G). In agreement with\nthe previous experiments, bands of very low intensity were\ndetected in MHC class I immunoprecipitates from the lysates\nof GFP\u0001 Akata Bx1g cells. Although it was clear that MHC\nclass I molecules in cells replicating EBV progress to the Golgi,\ndensitometry of endoH-sensitive and endoH-resistant bands\nindicated that there was a delay in MHC class I maturation\nduring the EBV lytic cycle. However, this delay was revealed\nonly upon a comparison of samples obtained at 2 h of chase\nand its signi\ufb01cance for the phenomenon of MHC class I down-\nregulation remains unclear.\nDISCUSSION\nStudy of EBV replication was hampered for a long time by\nthe lack of a permissive in vitro system. We hereby present a\nmodel for studying EBV replication that is based on a recom-\nbinant virus which drives GFP expression in infected cells\nduring the lytic cycle, enabling us to distinguish and sort cells\nsupporting virus replication from cells that remain in latency.\nWe found that, at least in Akata Bx1g cells, GFP expression,\ndriven by the immediate-early CMV promoter from a cassette\ninserted into the thymidine kinase gene of the EBV genome,\nlargely coincides with expression of early and late lytic cycle\ngenes. The fact that high levels of GFP expression in Akata\nBx1g cells are observed only upon induction of the lytic cycle is\nmost likely explained by upregulation of the CMV promoter\nactivity or regulatory effects of the two thymidine kinase pro-\nmoters which lie upstream of the CMV promoter in the re-\ncombinant EBV strain and become activated in cells support-\ning EBV replication. An increase in EBV copy numbers during\nthe lytic cycle is unlikely to contribute to this phenomenon,\nbecause inhibition of EBV DNA synthesis by acyclovir does\nnot signi\ufb01cantly affect GFP expression in anti-Ig-stimulated\nAkata cells. In the present study, we utilized this model to\nanalyze the in\ufb02uence of the EBV lytic cycle on the MHC class\nI processing and presentation pathway. We observed that EBV\nreplication results in MHC class I downregulation at the cell\nsurface of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma Akata cells, as well as the epi-\nthelial cell lines AGS and HCT116, infected with the recom-\nbinant EBV strain (Fig. 1). Kinetic analysis of viral gene ex-\npression in Akata cells indicated that the MHC class I\ndownregulation precedes the expression of late genes of the\nEBV lytic cycle. Accordingly, treatment with acyclovir, which\nblocks late EBV gene expression and virus DNA replication,\ndid not prevent MHC class I downregulation in cells expressing\nGFP and BZLF1 following anti-Ig cross-linking (Fig. 2). It is\nnot surprising that the recombinant virus retains sensitivity to\nacyclovir even though its thymidine kinase gene is disrupted,\nbecause EBV thymidine kinase does not phosphorylate acyclo-\nvir and the effect of this drug is determined by the exquisite\nsensitivity of the viral DNA polymerase to phosphorylated\nacyclovir presumably generated by cellular or other viral ki-\nnases (12, 26).\nMHC class I downregulation in the course of EBV replica-\ntion observed in our model recapitulates recent \ufb01ndings by\nRessing et al., who characterized this phenomenon by using\nEBV-positive Akata cells transfected with a reporter plasmid\nin which expression of the extracellular and transmembrane\ndomains of the rat CD2 molecule, with GFP replacing the\nfunctional cytosolic domain, is driven by the early BZLF1-\nresponsive promoter (29). Here we extend this \ufb01nding towards\nmore extensive characterization of the MHC class I-processing\npathway during the course of EBV replication. We demon-\nstrate that the expression levels of MHC class I molecules\nencoded by each of the three loci, A, B, or C, are decreased to\nsimilar extents on the surface of cells in the lytic cycle (Fig.\n1D). This correlates with signi\ufb01cantly decreased levels of MHC\nclass I heavy chains and \u00022m in total cell lysates (Fig. 3 and 4).\nInterestingly, Ressing et al. have not observed any modulation\nof heavy chain levels in their model of EBV replication (29).\nThis discrepancy can be partly explained by the fact that in the\nprevious study, cells replicating the virus were compared to\nuntreated cells in culture, while we observed a signi\ufb01cant MHC\nclass I upregulation on the surface of cells which were sub-\njected to lytic cycle-inducing stimuli, e.g., anti-Ig antibody, but\nremained in latency (Fig. 1B). Therefore, in our analysis, we\nalways compared cells in the lytic cycle to similarly treated cells\nin latency obtained by sorting the same cell culture into GFP\u0001\nand GFP\u0006 populations. In contrast to the changes observed in\nthe total pool of heavy chains, free heavy chains accumulated\nin cells supporting EBV replication (Fig. 3B). In activated\nhuman T cells, MHC class I molecules coexist in two confor-\nmation states, folded and misfolded, and can be identi\ufb01ed by\n1398\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nthe monoclonal antibodies W6/32 and HC10, respectively. In\nthese cells, the pool of misfolded heavy chains is found in\nassociation with calreticulin and ERp57 (3, 30). Our results\npoint to a possible role of both calreticulin and calnexin in\nstabilizing different pools of free heavy chains. Although cal-\nreticulin and, to a lesser extent, calnexin accumulate on the\nsurface of cells supporting the virus lytic cycle, the levels of\ncalreticulin in total cell lysates are reduced, whereas calnexin is\nincreased (Fig. 4). This suggests that a proportion of free heavy\nchains could be stabilized by calnexin intracellularly, whereas\ncalreticulin aids their stabilization at the surface. It is also\npossible that some free heavy chains associated with chaper-\nones and especially with calreticulin acquire a folded confor-\nmation, which is seen by the W6/32 antibody. That could ex-\nplain why \u00022m seems to be downregulated to a greater extent\nthan assembled MHC class I molecules in cells replicating the\nvirus (Fig. 3B).\nAlthough it has been suggested that free heavy chains and\nMHC class I molecules devoid of peptides can interact with\nNK cell receptors and modulate the functional outcome of\ntarget cell recognition by NK cells (2, 7, 22), it remains to be\nestablished whether the accumulation of free MHC class I\nheavy chains at the cell surface serves any immunological func-\ntion in cells replicating EBV.\nCalreticulin is found in the ER membrane, the nucleus, and\non the cell surface of most mammalian cells. Cellular stress,\nincluding apoptosis, induces expression of calreticulin and\nleads to an increase of its cell surface expression and redistri-\nbution, whereby calreticulin becomes associated with phospha-\ntidylserine (11). At least in part, the surface accumulation of\ncalreticulin could be a re\ufb02ection of apoptotic changes associ-\nated with EBV replication but could also have different func-\ntional implications. Calreticulin has been shown to interact\nwith perforin and inhibit perforin-mediated killing. This pro-\ntection seems to occur independently of direct interaction with\nperforin, and it has been proposed that calreticulin stabilizes\nthe membrane and prevents pore formation induced by per-\nforin (9). Although MHC class I downregulation may lead to\nincreased sensitivity of cells to NK lysis (20), functional con-\nsequences of EBV replication in terms of its effect on recog-\nnition by CTLs or NK cells remain to be characterized, and\ncalreticulin could affect perforin-mediated lysis of EBV-in-\nfected cells during the lytic cycle.\nPulse-chase analysis of MHC class I molecules in cells rep-\nlicating EBV showed a strong reduction in the levels of newly\nmade heavy chains and \u00022m (Fig. 5). Targeting proteins for\ndegradation is a common strategy utilized by herpesviruses to\nensure their persistence and/or escape from immune surveil-\nlance (see reference 27 for a review). In particular, cytomeg-\nalovirus encodes at least two proteins, US2 and US11, which\ntarget MHC class I heavy chains for retrograde transport from\nthe ER to cytosol (21, 35). A decrease in the amount of newly\nmade heavy chains was clearly detected after brief metabolic\nlabeling and could not be rescued by a combination of protea-\nsomal and lysosomal inhibitors, strongly suggesting that target-\ning of heavy chains for protein degradation does not play a role\nin the observed MHC class I downregulation (Fig. 5C and D).\nRessing et al. have shown that the functional activity of the\nTAP heterodimer is inhibited during EBV replication, al-\nthough the expression of TAP1 and TAP2 appeared to be\nunaffected (29). In our system, expression of TAP2, but not\nTAP1, was decreased by about 30% in cells supporting virus\nreplication (Fig. 4). We also observed downregulation of\nERp57, another functionally important member of the peptide\nloading complex, and TPPII, an endopeptidase implicated in\nthe generation of peptide ligands presented by MHC class I\nmolecules. These changes could, indeed, result in a lower ef-\n\ufb01ciency of MHC class I assembly, which is usually re\ufb02ected in\ndelayed class I maturation, as assessed by changes in the\nendoH sensitivity of sugars attached to these molecules and\nmodi\ufb01ed during their progression from the ER to the Golgi\ncompartment. We detected a delay in MHC class I maturation\nduring the EBV lytic cycle in Akata cells; however, this delay\nwas revealed only upon comparison of samples obtained at 2 h\nof chase (Fig. 5G), and its signi\ufb01cance for the phenomenon of\nMHC class I downregulation remains unclear. It is conceivable\nthat strong inhibition of MHC class I heavy chain synthesis\nobserved during EBV replication minimizes competition of\nnewly produced heavy chains for available peptide ligands,\neven if the latter are supplied at a decreased rate due to\ninhibition of the TAP heterodimer. Whether inhibition of TAP\nfunction plays a more signi\ufb01cant role at a particular stage of\nthe virus lytic cycle remains to be determined.\nNonspeci\ufb01c inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide\ncauses downregulation of MHC class I comparable to that\nobserved in Akata cells during the EBV lytic cycle (Fig. 5F).\nThe notion that the inhibition of MHC class I heavy chain and\n\u00022m synthesis plays the primary role in MHC class I down-\nregulation in the course of EBV replication is consistent with\na recent demonstration of skewing of EBV lytic cycle-speci\ufb01c\nCTL responses towards the immediate-early and early proteins\n(28). In this scenario, the immediate-early and early proteins\ncould be still processed and presented before the virus-induced\ninhibition of protein synthesis comes into force and the existing\npool of nonassembled heavy chains and \u00022m gets depleted. A\ndetailed discussion of mechanisms which could account for the\ninhibition of MHC class I synthesis by the immediate-early or\nearly proteins of the EBV lytic cycle is outside the scope of this\narticle. It has been proposed that the activity of LMP1, which\ninduces the IRF7 transcription factor and upregulates MHC\nclass I expression (37, 38), can be counteracted by BZLF1\nthrough its interference with IRF7 (14). MHC class I upregu-\nlation induced by B-cell-receptor triggering involves NF-\rB\nand can also be counteracted by BZLF1 through its interfer-\nence with the NF-\rB p65 subunit (13, 25). However, these\nmechanisms do not seem to be suf\ufb01cient, because the level of\nclass I synthesis in cells replicating EBV is much lower than\nthat in noninduced control Akata cells, which have not re-\nceived an activating signal and do not express LMP1. Other\nmechanisms may be at play in inhibiting basic transcription of\nMHC class I molecules and potentially include BZLF1-depen-\ndent inhibition of transcription factors such as CREB and TBP\n(1, 23), as well as inhibition of nuclear export of spliced cellular\nmRNAs by BMLF1 (4, 33). Regardless of the speci\ufb01c molec-\nular event(s) involved in this phenomenon, our data strongly\nsuggest that virus-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis\nthrough reduction of mRNA expression is the major mecha-\nnism of MHC class I downregulation during the EBV lytic\ncycle.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS I DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1399\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by grants awarded to V.L. by the Swedish\nCancer Society, Swedish Children Cancer Foundation, and IRIS Cen-\nter of the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research.\nWe thank Lindsey Hutt-Fletcher (Louisiana State University,\nShreveport, LA) for providing us with the recombinant EBV strain and\nEBV-infected cell lines.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Here we show that in several cell lines infected with a\nrecombinant EBV strain encoding green \ufb02uorescent protein (GFP), the virus lytic cycle coincides with GFP\nexpression, which thus can be used as a marker of virus replication. EBV replication resulted in downregu-\nlation of MHC class II and all classical MHC class I alleles independently of viral DNA synthesis or late gene\nexpression. Although assembled MHC class I complexes, the total pool of heavy chains, and \u00012-microglobulin\n(\u00012m) were signi\ufb01cantly downregulated, free class I heavy chains were stabilized at the surface of cells\nreplicating EBV. Calnexin expression was increased in GFP\u0002 cells, and calnexin and calreticulin accumulated\nat the cell surface that could contribute to the stabilization of class I heavy chains. Decreased expression levels\nof another chaperone, ERp57, and TAP2, a transporter associated with antigen processing and presentation,\ncorrelated with delayed kinetics of MHC class I maturation. Levels of both class I heavy chain and \u00012m mRNA\nwere reduced, and metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated a very low rate of class I heavy chain synthesis\nin lytically infected cells. MHC class I and MHC class II downregulation was mimicked by pharmacological\ninhibition of protein synthesis in latently infected cells. Our data suggest that although several mechanisms\nmay contribute to MHC class I downregulation in the course of EBV replication, inhibition of MHC class I\nsynthesis plays the primary role in the process.\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human gammaherpesvirus,\nwhich causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with a\nnumber of malignancies arising from B cells, epithelial cells,\nand other cell lineages. EBV establishes latent infection pre-\ndominantly, if not exclusively, in B lymphocytes, but virus rep-\nlication can occur in both B lymphocytes and epithelial cells of\nthe oropharynx. In the course of virus replication, approxi-\nmately 70 lytic cycle proteins are expressed in EBV-infected\ncells in three temporal stages: immediate early (IE), early, and\nlate. Entry into the lytic cycle is triggered by expression of\neither of the two IE genes BZLF1 and BRLF1. Both the\nBZLF1 and BRLF1 proteins function as transcriptional acti-\nvators and initiate the ordered cascade of viral lytic gene\nexpression culminating in the release of infectious virus (re-\nviewed in reference 18).\nThe majority of EBV carriers mount strong cytotoxic T-\nlymphocyte (CTL) responses speci\ufb01c to EBV lytic cycle anti-\ngens (5, 6, 15). EBV-speci\ufb01c CTLs appear to play the most\nimportant role in the immunological control of EBV replica-\ntion and EBV-induced malignant transformation. CTLs recog-\nnize their target cells through major histocompatibility com-\nplex (MHC) class I molecules loaded with antigen-derived\npeptides. Peptide ligands are generated in the cytosol by the\nproteolytic action of the proteasome and trimming peptidases\nand then translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by\nheterodimeric transporters associated with antigen presenta-\ntion 1 and 2 (TAP1 and TAP2). In the ER, MHC class I heavy\nchains interact with the chaperone calnexin, followed by inter-\naction with the chaperones calreticulin, ERp57, and \u00022-micro-\nglobulin (\u00022m) and a preformed complex of TAPs and tapasin.\nThis peptide loading complex is essential for ef\ufb01cient assembly\nof MHC class I complexes and their egress from the ER\nthrough the Golgi to the cell surface (reviewed in reference 8).\nTo escape from CD8\u0001 T-cell recognition and destruction, vi-\nruses have developed strategies to inhibit the expression of MHC\nclass I. These mechanisms include transcriptional downregulation\nof the heavy chain expression, interference with antigen process-\ning by the proteasome, blocking of peptide transport into the ER,\ndislocation of MHC class I heavy chains from the ER to the\ncytosol for subsequent degradation, retention of MHC class I in\nthe ER, and targeted degradation of class I from post-ER com-\npartments. Several of these strategies for herpes simplex virus,\nvaricella-zoster virus, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus,\nand most notably cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been dissected\nin detail previously (reviewed in references 19 and 36).\nEBV replication also results in downregulation of MHC\nclass I molecules at the surface of infected cells.

Previous\nstudies have shown that in lymphoblastoid cell lines, the EBV\nlytic cycle and MHC class I downregulation are paralleled by\ndownregulation of MHC class II, CD40, and CD54 while\nCD19, CD80, and CD86 are not affected, pointing to a possible\nspeci\ufb01city of the process (16). Reduction of MHC class I ex-\npression was found to be an early lytic cycle event that was not\ndependent on viral DNA replication. The immediate-early\nBZLF1 protein was implicated in MHC class I downregulation\nin lymphoblastoid cell lines through inhibition of latent mem-\nbrane protein 1 (LMP1), which upregulates MHC class I ex-\npression in cells latently infected by EBV and is also expressed\nthroughout the lytic cycle. A more ef\ufb01cient system has been\ndeveloped recently to study EBV replication based on trans-\nfection of EBV-positive Akata cells with a reporter which is\nexpressed during the lytic cycle, allowing identi\ufb01cation and\nisolation of cells supporting virus replication from those in\nlatency (29). Experiments performed with this model revealed\nthat the capacity of the TAP1/TAP2 heterodimer to translo-\ncate peptides into the ER is inhibited by up to 70% during\nEBV replication, and because the expression of MHC class I\nheavy chains was found to be unaltered, it was suggested that\nthis mechanism plays the primary role in downregulation of\nMHC class I molecules in the course of EBV replication (29).\nIn this study, we made use of a similar model based on a\nrecombinant Akata virus carrying a cassette expressing green\n\ufb02uorescent protein (GFP) and the neomycin resistance gene\ninserted into the open reading frame of the nonessential thy-\nmidine kinase gene (34). We show that in these cells, the GFP\ngene is expressed during the lytic cycle with kinetics similar to\nthose of the early EBV lytic genes. Thus, cells expressing GFP\ncan be identi\ufb01ed, separated, and used for immunological or\nbiochemical analysis of changes caused by virus replication in\nEBV-infected cells. Our results show that even though multi-\nple mechanisms might operate during EBV lytic replication,\ninhibition of MHC class I heavy chains and \u00022m synthesis is\none of the key mechanisms of EBV-induced MHC class I\ndownregulation.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell lines and induction of EBV replication. The Bx1g variants of the Burkitt\u2019s\nlymphoma cell line Akata (Akata Bx1g), the gastric carcinoma cell line AGS\n(AGS Bx1g), and the colorectal epithelial carcinoma cell line HCT116 (HCT116\nBx1g) were obtained by the infection of EBV-negative Akata, AGS, and HCT116\ncells with a recombinant virus originated from the EBV strain derived from the\nwild-type Akata cells. The recombinant virus was generated by introducing a\ncassette containing the neomycin resistance gene under the control of a thymi-\ndine kinase promoter and a modi\ufb01ed GFP gene under the control of the imme-\ndiate-early cytomegalovirus promoter into the open reading frame of the non-\nessential thymidine kinase gene (refer to reference 24 for more details on the\ngeneration of the virus). The Bx1g cell variants were grown in medium supple-\nmented with 500 \u0003g/ml of Geneticin sulfate (G418; Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis,\nMO). In Akata Bx1g cells, the EBV lytic cycle was induced by culturing in the\npresence of 50 \u0003g/ml goat F(ab\u0004)2 fragments speci\ufb01c to human immunoglobulin\nG (IgG; MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) for the indicated periods of time. The\nlytic cycle in AGS Bx1g and HCT116 Bx1g cells was induced by culturing for 24 h\nwith 30 ng/ml of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma Aldrich)\nand 0.5 mM sodium butyrate (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The chemicals were\nthen removed, and the culturing was continued for the indicated periods of time.\nAll cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with L-glutamine and 10%\nfetal calf serum.\nTo inhibit viral DNA replication and late lytic cycle gene expression or to block\nprotein synthesis, cells were cultured in the presence of 0.2 mM acyclovir\n(Alpharma, Oslo, Norway) or 50 \u0003g/ml cycloheximide (Sigma Aldrich), respectively.\nAntibodies. BZ.1 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) is a monoclonal antibody\n(MAb) speci\ufb01c to the immediate-early BZLF1 protein of EBV. 85K and 2L10\nare MAbs speci\ufb01c to the p85 early antigen of EBV and to the late envelope\nglycoprotein gp350/220, respectively. W6/32 (HB95; ATCC) is a pan-MHC class\nI-speci\ufb01c MAb which recognizes heavy chains associated with \u00022m. r\u0005HC (rabbit\nanti-heavy chain) is a rabbit antiserum that recognizes free heavy chains of MHC\nclass I molecules encoded by the human leukocyte antigen A (HLA-A), B, or C\nlocus (32) and HC10 is a MAb that binds to a linear epitope exposed on free\nheavy chains of the HLA-B and -C loci (32). Both Abs were a kind gift of Hidde\nPloegh (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The anti-HLA-A (clone 108-\n2C5) and -HLA-B (clone Joan-1) MAbs were both from Lab Vision (Fremont,\nCA). The L31 Ab recognizes a linear \u00051 domain epitope exposed on free heavy\nchains of HLA-C (a kind gift of Louise Berg, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm,\nSweden). Abs speci\ufb01c to ERp57 or calreticulin (both from StressGen, Victoria,\nCanada), calnexin (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), or tapasin (BD Bio-\nsciences) were used for both \ufb02ow cytometry and immunoblotting. Abs speci\ufb01c to\n\u00022m, clone TU\n\u00a8 99 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and TAP1 or TAP2 (BD\nBiosciences), as well as \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Ab against MHC\nclass I, MHC class II, CD19, and CD86 (all from BD Biosciences) were used for\n\ufb02ow cytometry. Rabbit antiserum speci\ufb01c to \u00022m (Dako), Abs against the pro-\nteasomal subunits LMP2, LMP7, MECL1 (monoclonal antibodies), and \u00053 (rab-\nbit polyclonal) (Af\ufb01nity Research, Plymouth Meeting, PA) as well as GFP-\nspeci\ufb01c Ab (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) or actin-speci\ufb01c Ab (Sigma Aldrich) were\nused only for immunoblotting. The tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII)-speci\ufb01c MAb\nwas from Immunesystem (Uppsala, Sweden). The TAP1- and TAP2-speci\ufb01c Abs\nused in immunoblotting were a kind gift from John Trowsdale (Cambridge\nInstitute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom). All antibody\npreparations used as isotype controls for \ufb02ow cytometry were purchased from\neither Dako or BD Biosciences. The goat anti-mouse allophycocyanin (APC)-\nconjugated antibody for indirect immunostaining was purchased from BD Bio-\nsciences. The relevant secondary antibodies for immunoblotting were purchased\nform Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden).\nFlow cytometry. At the indicated time points after induction, Akata Bx1g, AGS\nBx1g, or HCT116 Bx1g cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS), \ufb01xed for 25 min in Cyto\ufb01x/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences), washed three\ntimes in Perm/Wash solution (BD Biosciences), and blocked for 30 min on ice\nwith serum from an EBV-negative individual (5% in PBS). Samples were then\nincubated for 30 min on ice with primary unconjugated Abs, washed, and incu-\nbated with goat anti-mouse APC-conjugated Ab for an additional 30 min on ice.\nAll acquisitions were performed on a FACScalibur \ufb02ow cytometer and analyzed\nusing CellQuest (BD Biosciences). Double stainings were performed by labeling\ncells \ufb01rst with unconjugated BZLF1-speci\ufb01c Ab, whose binding was revealed by\nstaining with a relevant anti-mouse conjugate, as described above, followed by\nstaining with MHC class I-, class II-, CD19-, or CD86-speci\ufb01c directly conjugated\nAb. Staining for HLA-C with L31 Ab, which recognizes free HLA-C heavy\nchains, was performed after the cells were treated for 2 min with a low-pH buffer\n(0.131 M citric acid, 0.066 M Na2HPO4, pH 3.3) to elute the peptides and\ndissociate the heavy chain from \u00022m.\nAnalysis of protein expression by immunoblotting. Akata Bx1g cells were\ninduced with IgG-speci\ufb01c Abs for either 24 or 48 h and then sorted using a\nMoFlo sorter (Dako Cytomation) into GFP\u0001 and GFP\u0006 cells. 7AAD (BD\nBiosciences) was used to exclude dead cells during sorting. Cells were counted\nand pelleted, and the same numbers of GFP-positive cells and GFP-negative\ncells were lysed in reducing electrophoresis sample buffer (1 \u0007 106 cells/100 \u0003l).\nElectrophoresis was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gels or 8 to 16% poly-\nduramide gradient gels (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) and proteins were\ntransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Mem-\nbranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% skimmed milk and probed with\ndifferent primary Abs followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to horserad-\nish peroxidase. The signal was detected using Super Signal chemiluminescence\ndetection solution (Pierce, Rockford, IL), and images were acquired on a LAS-\n3000 luminescent image analyzer (Fuji\ufb01lm Medical Systems, Stamford, CT).\nPulse-chase experiments, immunoprecipitation and MHC class I maturation.\nLytic cycle was induced in Akata Bx1g cells for 24 or 48 h, which were then sorted\ninto GFP\u0001 (lytic) and GFP\u0006 (latent), as described above. For metabolic labeling,\n2 \u0007 106 cells/sample were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, spun down, and resuspended in fresh\nprewarmed methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco\u2019s modi\ufb01ed Eagle\u2019s medium\n(DMEM) with 150 \u0003Ci of [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine (Redivue Pro-mix\nL-[35S] in vitro cell labeling mix; Amersham) and cultured for 2 h at 37\u00b0C.\nFor short pulse-chase experiments, cells were labeled for 2 min with 400 \u0003Ci\nRedivue Pro-mix. Labeling was terminated by the addition of nonradioactive\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS I DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1391\n\nL-methionine and L-cysteine (1 mM) (Sigma), and samples were pelleted and\nfrozen at time zero or at 5 and 30 min of chase.\nTo assess the role of protein degradation, cells were incubated in methionine-\nand cysteine-free DMEM at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of the proteasomal\ninhibitor lactacystine (10 \u0003M) and the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (4 \u0003M)\n(Sigma). Cells were labeled for 20 min with 400 \u0003Ci Redivue Pro-mix, washed,\nand then pelleted.\nFor the assessment of MHC class I maturation, cells were pulsed for 30 min,\nlabeling was terminated as described above, cells were washed once and reincu-\nbated in prewarmed DMEM containing excess unlabeled L-methionine and L-\ncysteine and 10% fetal calf serum. Samples were collected immediately after the\npulse (time zero) and at 1 h and 2 h of chase.\nSamples were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1\nmM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \ufb02uoride) on ice. After\n30 min, nuclei were removed by centrifugation (relative centrifugal force, 3,000;\n10 min). MHC class I molecules were immunoprecipitated with either W6/32 or\nr\u0005HC Abs after preclearing with mouse or rabbit serum, respectively.\nFor endo-\u0002-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endoH) digestion, immune com-\nplexes bound to protein A Sepharose beads were eluted by incubation at 95\u00b0C for\n5 min in elution buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate, 3 mM EDTA, 0.25% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate [SDS], pH 6.0). One half of each sample was digested overnight\nat 37\u00b0C with 2 mU endoH (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and the other half was\nmock digested. Samples were mixed with reducing electrophoresis loading buffer\nand analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on a 10%\npolyacrylamide gel. Gels were \ufb01xed (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 5% glyc-\nerol), vacuum dried, and incubated in a Hypercassette (Amersham), and the\nsignal was revealed in a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, GE\nHealthcare).\nReal-time RT-PCR (RNA preparation and reverse transcription). After in-\nduction of the lytic cycle, Akata Bx1g cells were sorted into GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001\npopulations, carefully counted, and RNA was extracted from 1 \u0007 106 cells of\neach population according to the instructions of the QIAGEN RNA blood\nminikit (Hilden, Germany). RNA was eluted with 30 \u0003l of RNase-free water.\nThe cDNA synthesis was performed in a total volume of 50 \u0003l containing 30 \u0003l\nRNA, 1 \u0007 \ufb01rst-strand buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM\nMgCl2), 105 \u0003g/ml pdN6 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), 1 mM of each\ndeoxynucleoside triphosphate (Amersham Biosciences), 1 mM dithiothreitol,\n0.48 units/\u0003l RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), and 4.8 units/\u0003l Moloney murine\nleukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT; Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland), at 37\u00b0C\nfor 1.5 h. The reaction was stopped by heating at 68\u00b0C for 15 min.\nReal-time PCR. A total of 2.5 \u0003l of cDNA was used in a 25-\u0003l reaction mixture\ncontaining 1\u0007 SYBR green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 300 nM\nof each primer. Primers and primer sequences were as follows: HLA class I-F,\n5\u0004-ACC TGG AGA ACG GGA AGG A-3\u0004; HLA class I-R, 5\u0004-TGT GAT CTC\nCGC AGG GTA GAA-3\u0004; \u00022m-F, 5\u0004-GAT GAG TAT GCC TGC CGT GTG-3\u0004;\n\u00022m-R, 5\u0004-CAA TCC AAA TGC GGC ATC T-3\u0004; G6PD-F, 5\u0004-TGC CCC CGA\nCCG TCT AC-3\u0004; G6PD-R, 5\u0004-ATG CGG TTC CAG CCT ATC TG-3\u0004; ABL-F,\n5\u0004-CGA AGG GAG GGT GTA CCA TTA C-3\u0004; ABL-R, 5\u0004-CGT TGA ATG\nATG ATG AAC CAA CTC-3\u0004. The PCR was performed and analyzed on the\nABI 7000 sequence detection system with the following PCR conditions: 50\u00b0C for\n2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 PCR ampli\ufb01cation cycles with 95\u00b0C for\n15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Relative quanti\ufb01cation of gene expression was calculated\naccording to the Delta-Delta CT method. The formula used was 2\b\tCT\n, where \tCT\nequals the cycle threshold (CT) of a given gene in GFP\u0001 cells minus the CT of the\nsame gene in GFP\u0006 cells.\nRESULTS\nAn alternative model for EBV lytic replication. Analysis of\nEBV lytic replication has been hampered by the lack of suit-\nable permissive systems of virus infection. Recently, Ressing et\nal. described a new experimental model of EBV replication\nbased on transfection of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma Akata cells with a\nplasmid encoding the rat CD2 extracellular and transmem-\nbrane domains, with the cytosolic domain replaced with GFP\n(29). Expression of the fusion protein in this construct is driven\nby the BMRF1 early gene promoter. Upon induction of the\nlytic cycle by cross-linking of surface immunoglobulins, trans-\nfected cells supporting virus replication could be either studied\nbased on their GFP expression or isolated with anti-rat CD2\nbeads (29).\nWe made use of an alternative system in which a cassette\nencoding the GFP gene under control of the CMV immediate-\nearly promoter was inserted into the open reading frame of the\nnonessential thymidine kinase gene of the wild-type Akata\nvirus (34). This recombinant virus was used to infect an EBV-\nnegative variant of the Akata cell line, the gastric carcinoma\ncell line AGS, and the colorectal epithelial carcinoma cell line\nHCT116, generating EBV-positive cell lines referred to as\nAkata Bx1g, AGS Bx1g, and HCT116 Bx1g, respectively.\nCultures of cells infected with the recombinant virus typi-\ncally contained a small population of cells in lytic replication\n(Fig. 1A, upper panels; data not shown for HCT116 Bx1g\ncells). In Akata Bx1g cells, the expression of the immediate-\nearly gene BZLF1 quite strictly coincided with expression of\nGFP, whereas both GFP single-positive and GFP/BZLF1 dou-\nble-positive populations could be clearly distinguished in AGS\nBx1g cells and HCT116 Bx1g cells before and after induction\nof the lytic cycle. This probably re\ufb02ects the higher steady-state\nactivity of the CMV promoter in epithelial cells. Upon induc-\ntion of the lytic cycle by surface IgG cross-linking or TPA and\nsodium butyrate, the proportions of Akata Bx1g and AGS\nBx1g cells replicating EBV increased from approximately 2%\nto 40% and from 3% to 10%, respectively.\nIn accordance with previous reports, cells supporting lytic\nreplication expressed decreased surface levels of MHC class I\n(Fig. 1A, lower panels, and B) and MHC class II (Fig. 1C).\nInduction of the virus lytic cycle increased the number of cells\nwith low levels of surface MHC class I in Akata Bx1g, AGS\nBx1g (Fig. 1A and B, lower panels), and HCT116 Bx1g (data\nnot shown) cells, although the kinetics of this process was\nslower in the epithelial cells, with visible increase of the GFP/\nBZLF1 double-positive population only 48 h posttreatment\nand onwards. In our experimental model, Ig cross-linking or\nTPA-sodium butyrate treatment led to an increase in MHC\nclass I expression on the surface of cells that remained in\nlatency compared to that on control untreated cells (Fig. 1B,\nupper panels). This observation contrasts with the \ufb01ndings of\nRessing et al., who observed no difference in MHC class I\nexpression between anti-Ig-treated and untreated cells latently\ninfected with the virus (29). Therefore, in all experiments, we\ncompared GFP\u0001 cells replicating the virus with the GFP\u0006\npopulation within the same cultures exposed to lytic cycle-\ninducing stimuli.\nTo exclude the possibility that the observed effect of virus\nreplication on MHC class I expression was caused by the ex-\npression of GFP or other unknown effects mediated by the\nrecombinant virus, wild-type Akata cells were induced to rep-\nlicate EBV and then costained with the BZLF1-speci\ufb01c anti-\nbody and one of the antibodies speci\ufb01c to MHC class I, MHC\nclass II, CD19, or CD86 (Fig. 1C). As previously reported,\nsurface expression of CD19 and CD86 remained unchanged,\nwhereas levels of MHC class I and II were decreased in cells\nreplicating the virus. All classical MHC class I alleles were\ndownregulated by approximately 60% on average in lytically\ninfected Akata Bx1g cells as revealed by staining with antibod-\nies that recognize pan-HLA-A, pan-HLA-B, or pan-HLA-C\n(Fig. 1D).\nTo get an insight into the role of different EBV proteins in\n1392\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nFIG. 1. EBV lytic replication results in GFP expression and MHC class I downregulation in Akata Bx1g and AGS Bx1g cells. Akata cells\ncarrying a recombinant EBV strain with the GFP gene inserted under the immediate-early CMV promoter into the virus genome (Akata Bx1g\ncells) or AGS gastric epithelial cells infected with the same virus (AGS Bx1g cells) were treated as described in Materials and Methods to induce\nthe EBV lytic cycle. Staining with the indicated speci\ufb01c antibodies and \ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis were performed as\ndescribed in Materials and Methods. A. EBV replication, GFP expression, and MHC class I downregulation coincide in Akata Bx1g and AGS Bx1g\ncells. To induce EBV replication, cells were cultured either with F(ab\u0004)2 fragments speci\ufb01c to human IgG for the indicated periods of time (Akata\nBx1g) or with TPA and sodium butyrate (AGS Bx1g) for 24 h, washed, and incubated in standard culture medium for the remaining time of\ninduction. The four upper panels show intracellular staining for BZLF1. The lower panels show surface staining for MHC class I using W6/32\nantibody. In both cases, anti-mouse APC-conjugated antibody was used to detect binding of primary antibodies. The R1 and R2 regions in the\nlower panels de\ufb01ne two different cell populations, GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells, respectively, that were used for FACS analysis and cell sorting in this\nand all subsequent experiments. B. Signals used to activate the EBV lytic cycle in Akata or AGS cells induce overall upregulation of MHC class\nI, which is overridden by virus replication. Surface staining for MHC class I was done with W6/32 antibody and APC-conjugated anti-mouse\nsecondary antibody. The upper panel shows the expression of MHC class I in the total population of either control (noninduced) or anti-IgG-\ntreated (Akata-induced) or TPA-butyrate-treated (AGS-induced) cells. The four lower panels show either control or induced cells, each divided\ninto GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 populations. The histograms are presented to illustrate the distribution of cells with different levels of MHC class I\nexpression in cultures replicating the virus. C. Wild-type Akata cells downregulate MHC class I and MHC class II molecules upon induction of\nthe EBV lytic cycle. Wild-type EBV-positive Akata cells were incubated with F(ab\u0004)2 fragments speci\ufb01c to human IgG for 24 h. Indirect\nintracellular staining for BZLF1 was followed by staining with directly conjugated MHC class I-, class II-, CD19-, or CD86-speci\ufb01c antibody. Cells\nwere gated as BZLF1 positive (pos) or BZLF1 negative (neg). The geometric means of \ufb02uorescence intensities (Geo MFI) of the gated populations\nare shown. D. HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles are downregulated to similar extents during EBV replication. At 24 h after induction, the levels of surface\nexpression of classical MHC class I molecules were assessed in Akata Bx1g cells with either a pan-MHC class I-speci\ufb01c antibody (W6/32) or\nantibodies speci\ufb01cally recognizing HLA-A, -B, or -C alleles. The geometric means of \ufb02uorescence intensity obtained with each of the indicated\nantibodies for GFP-positive cells are shown as percentages relative to those of anti-IgG-treated GFP-negative (latent) cells (the means and\nstandard deviations of three experiments).\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS I DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1393\n\nthe downregulation of MHC class I expression, we \ufb01rst as-\nsessed the kinetics of this process in relation to the kinetics of\nexpression of immediate-early, early or late EBV proteins fol-\nlowing induction of the lytic cycle. The immediate-early gene\nBZLF1 was already expressed after 6 h of induction of the\nlytic cycle in Akata Bx1g cells (Fig. 2). Early gene expres-\nsion, assessed by staining for the EA-R protein, was unde-\ntectable at 6 h but picked up at 12 h, when virtually all cells\nexpressing immediate-early genes also expressed early genes\n(Fig. 2A). At this time point, a small proportion of cells\nalready expressed late genes, as assessed by staining for the\nenvelope glycoprotein gp350/220, but late gene expression\nby the majority of GFP\u0001 cells was seen only at 24 h. The\npercentage of cells that express lytic cycle genes peaked at\n24 h, followed by a decrease at 48 h, which could be due to\ncell death as a result of lytic replication. Surface MHC class\nI was slightly upregulated at 6 h postinduction in cells that\nexpressed BZLF1 in comparison to cells that were subjected\nto anti-Ig treatment but remained in latency. This upregu-\nlation was quickly reverted, and by 12 h, MHC class I was\nreduced by 20%; the extent of downregulation continued to\nincrease, reaching its peak at 48 h. The degree of downregu-\nlation varied between individual experiments but averaged\n60% by 48 h.\nThe fact that the surface levels of MHC class I were already\ndecreased by 12 h postinduction, as well as the fact that as-\nsembled molecules should have an average half-life of 6 to 8 h,\nsuggested that MHC class I downregulation is induced by an\nimmediate-early or early EBV proteins. In agreement with this\nassumption and previously published data (16), acyclovir\ngreatly decreased late gene expression in induced Akata cells\nand reduced percentages of cells expressing BZLF1 but did not\nsigni\ufb01cantly affect the levels of BZLF1 expression and MHC\nclass I downregulation in BZLF1-positive cells (Fig. 2B).\nFIG. 2. MHC class I downregulation is independent of virus DNA replication. A. MHC class I downregulation is an early event in the virus\nlytic cycle. The lytic cycle was induced in Akata Bx1g cells by IgG cross-linking, and the levels of expression of immediate-early (BZLF1), early\n(EA-R-p85), and late (gp350/220) lytic cycle antigens were assessed by intracellular staining. In parallel, surface MHC class I was detected at each\ntime point after induction. Percentages of cells positive for each of the antigens at the indicated time points are shown on the left y axis, whereas\nthe relative MHC class I downregulation in GFP-positive cells compared with the GFP-negative cells is shown on the right y axis. B. MHC class\nI downregulation is independent of virus DNA replication and late gene expression. Akata Bx1g cells were induced by IgG cross-linking in the\npresence or absence of 0.2 mM acyclovir. At the indicated time points, cells were collected and stained for intracellular BZLF1 or gp350/220\nexpression. The numbers inside the dot plots indicate percentages of cells in the relevant quadrants. Mean \ufb02uorescence intensity of BZLF1-speci\ufb01c\nstaining is shown for cells positive for both GFP and BZLF1. In parallel, samples were also stained for surface MHC class I, and the percentage\nof MHC class I downregulation was assessed as described above. The results of this analysis are shown on the graph.\n1394\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nThe total pool of MHC class I heavy chains and \u00012m is\ndownregulated, whereas free heavy chains accumulate in cells\nreplicating EBV. To understand the fate of MHC class I in\ncells replicating EBV, we \ufb01rst asked whether the surface down-\nregulation of assembled molecules re\ufb02ected the overall de-\ncrease of heavy chain expression in these cells. Akata Bx1g\ncells were sorted into GFP\u0006 (latent) and GFP\u0001 (lytic) popu-\nlations at 48 h after induction. Western blot analysis of total\ncell lysates showed that lytic replication reduces the expression\nof MHC class I heavy chains as detected by two different heavy\nchain-speci\ufb01c antibodies (Fig. 3A). Levels of \u00022m were also\nstrongly reduced. In accordance with downregulation of assem-\nbled MHC class I at the cell surface (Fig. 1), cells subjected to\nsurface IgG cross-linking but remaining in latency (GFP\u0006)\nexpressed slightly increased amounts of heavy chains in total\ncell lysates compared to noninduced controls (Fig. 4A). Cells\nin the lytic cycle had reduced levels of total heavy chains in\nFIG. 3. Free heavy chains accumulate during lytic replication. A.\nTotal MHC class I heavy chains and \u00022m are downregulated in GFP-\npositive Akata Bx1g cells. Immunoblotting of total cell lysates of Akata\nBx1g cells induced for 48 h with anti-IgG antibodies and sorted into\nGFP\u0001 (lytic) and GFP\u0006 (latent) cells. The heavy chain expression was\nassessed by two different antibodies: r\u0005HC, a rabbit antiserum that\nrecognizes heavy chains of HLA-A, -B, and -C, and HC10, a mouse\nmonoclonal antibody speci\ufb01c for heavy chains of the HLA-B and -C\nloci. B. Both surface and total pools of assembled MHC class I mol-\necules as well as \u00022m are downregulated during EBV replication while\nfree MHC class I heavy chains accumulate in lytically infected cells.\nThe upper panel shows density plots of Akata Bx1g cells 48 h after\ninduction, surface stained with W6/32 (for assembled MHC class I),\nHC10 (for free MHC class I heavy chains), or TU\n\u00a8 99 (for \u00022m) anti-\nbodies obtained in one representative experiment.

N.D., not detected.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS I DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1395\n\ncomparison to either noninduced or induced but latently in-\nfected cells.\nNext, we studied the expression of assembled MHC class I,\nfree heavy chains, and \u00022m both at the cell surface and in\npermeabilized cells, the latter re\ufb02ecting the total pool of the\nanalyzed molecules. The density plots in Fig. 3B show a typical\nsurface staining for these molecules at 48 h postinduction.\nBoth assembled MHC class I and \u00022m were decreased in\npermeabilized cells and on the surface of GFP\u0001 cells com-\npared to GFP\u0006 cells at 24 h postinduction, and this downregu-\nlation became more pronounced at 48 h (Fig. 3B). In contrast,\nthe levels of free heavy chain, detected by the MAb HC10,\nwere unchanged at 24 h and tended to increase at 48 h in lytic\ncells compared to those in cells in latency. Also, downregula-\ntion of \u00022m at the cell surface was statistically more signi\ufb01cant\n(P value in nonpaired t test, 0.01) than that of assembled MHC\nclass I after 48 h of lytic cycle induction. A stronger downregu-\nlation of \u00022m was also revealed upon staining of permeabilized\ncells after 24 h of induction (P value, 0.002). Taken together,\nthese results reveal that during EBV replication, expression\nlevels of both heavy chains and \u00022m are downregulated, and\n\u00022m seems to be reduced to a greater extent. At the same time,\nboth the total pool and surface fraction of free heavy chains are\nincreased, suggesting that free heavy chains selectively accu-\nmulate at the surface of cells supporting the lytic cycle.\nProteins that aid the generation of folded and peptide-\nloaded MHC class I are modulated during EBV lytic replica-\ntion. To investigate whether other mechanisms, in addition to\ndecreased expression of heavy chains and \u00022m, contribute to\nMHC class I downregulation in lytically infected cells, expres-\nsion of several components of the MHC class I processing\npathway in GFP\u0001 and GFP\u0006 Akata Bx1g cells was analyzed by\nimmunoblotting. GFP\u0006 cells were always negative for BZLF1\nexpression regardless of the time period between induction of\nthe lytic cycle and cell sorting (24 or 48 h). No signi\ufb01cant\nchanges could be observed in the expression of LMP2, LMP7,\nand MECL-1 subunits of the immunoproteasome (Fig. 4A),\nnor was there a change in the expression of the nonproteolytic\nconstitutive \u00053 proteasomal subunit. TPPII, another cytosolic\npeptidase implicated in the generation of MHC class I peptide\nepitopes, was slightly downregulated.\nTo compare the expression levels of peptide transporters\nand ER chaperones that play a role in the assembly and pep-\ntide loading of MHC class I, both immunoblotting and \ufb02ow\ncytometry analysis of protein expression at the cell surface and\nin permeabilized cells were used as described for Fig. 3 and in\nMaterials and Methods. Signi\ufb01cant accumulation of calnexin\nwas observed mostly in the intracellular compartments of cells\nin the lytic cycle after 24 h of induction. In contrast, calreticulin\naccumulated on the surface, while its overall expression was\nreduced by up to 50% (Fig. 4). Expression of the chaperone\nERp57 showed a general reduction. Tapasin, TAP1, and TAP2\ncould not be detected at the cell surface by \ufb02ow cytometry, and\ntheir overall levels were not modulated signi\ufb01cantly, as de-\ntected by immunoblotting, with the exception of TAP2, whose\nexpression was decreased by approximately 30% (Fig. 4).\nMHC class I synthesis is reduced during lytic replication.\nHerpesviruses target MHC class I molecules for degradation\nthrough a number of mechanisms (31). Therefore, we investi-\ngated whether the decrease of MHC class I heavy chain ex-\npression in the course of EBV replication is due to inhibition\nof heavy chain synthesis or targeted protein degradation. In-\nduced and sorted Akata Bx1g cells were labeled with [35S]me-\nthionine and [35S]cysteine, and their lysates were immunopre-\ncipitated with W6/32 or r\u0005\u000bC antibodies speci\ufb01c to assembled\nMHC class I or free heavy chains, respectively. After 2 h of\nlabeling, most labeled heavy chains were associated with \u00022m\nand recovered with W6/32 antibody from control cells (Fig.\n5A). Comparison of GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells revealed a drastic\nreduction in 35S-labeled W6/32- and r\u0005HC-reactive molecules\nin cells replicating the virus. The amount of de novo-synthe-\nsized MHC class I molecules was strongly reduced, by approx-\nimately 85% in GFP\u0001 cells. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation\nof [35S]methionine-labeled cellular proteins revealed that cells\nin the lytic cycle incorporated the amino acid at 25% of the\nlevel of GFP\u0006 cells in latency (data not shown). This is con-\nsistent with overall inhibition of protein synthesis in cells rep-\nlicating the virus. However, heavy chain downregulation ob-\nserved by immunoblotting of total lysates of the same cells was\nrelatively moderate, reaching only about 40% reduction in\nband intensity (Fig. 5B).\nThese results could re\ufb02ect two non-mutually exclusive sce-\nnarios, that heavy chains are synthesized at a low rate or newly\nmade molecules are rapidly degraded. To address this ques-\ntion, we performed pulse-chase experiments on sorted cell\npopulations, in which cells were metabolically labeled for 2 min\nand chased immediately at time zero or 5 or 30 min postlabel-\ning. The cell lysates were sequentially immunoprecipitated\nwith W6/32 and r\u0005HC antibodies (Fig. 5C). In cells infected\nwith EBV latently, r\u0005HC-reactive molecules were visible at\ntime zero and their intensity decreased at the subsequent time\npoints, whereas the amount of assembled, W6/32-reactive\nMHC class I molecules increased over time. However, both\nW6/32- and r\u0005HC-reactive molecules were practically unde-\ntectable in cells replicating the virus, supporting the notion that\nthe rate of MHC class I synthesis is low during the EBV lytic\ncycle. This experiment still did not rule out completely the\npossibility that heavy chains are synthesized but degraded im-\nmediately. Therefore, we pretreated cells with a combination\nof lactacystin, a speci\ufb01c inhibitor of the proteasome, and chlo-\nroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation, and then per-\nformed metabolic labeling and sequential immunoprecipita-\ntion as described above (Fig. 5D). Immunoprecipitation of\nlysates of GFP\u0006 cells with the W6/32 and r\u0005HC antibodies\nshowed an accumulation of relevant protein moieties in cells\npretreated with the inhibitors. In contrast, neither W6/32- nor\nr\u0005HC-reactive species were revealed in cells replicating EBV\neven upon inhibition of protein degradation. Immunoprecipi-\ntation of \u00022m also performed in this series of experiments\ndemonstrated that its synthesis was inhibited in GFP\u0001 cells to\nan extent comparable to that observed for MHC class I heavy\nchains (data not shown).\nTo investigate whether decreased transcription/increased\nturnover of mRNA contributes to the decrease of MHC class\nI heavy chain synthesis, the abundance of mRNA message for\nthe classical MHC class I molecules and \u00022m was determined\nusing real-time RT-PCR analysis. Since CT values for mRNA\nof housekeeping genes (G6PD [glucose-6-phosphate dehydro-\ngenase] and Abl protein kinase genes) were increased in GFP\u0001\ncells (data not shown), normalization to housekeeping gene\n1396\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nFIG. 5. Reduced synthesis of MHC class I is associated with inhibition of transcription during lytic replication. Akata Bx1g cells were induced\nwith anti-IgG for either 48 h (A and B) or 24 h (C, D, E, F, and G) and then sorted into GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 populations. Both populations were\nincubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM prior to metabolic labeling. The bands shown in all experiments correspond\nto the heavy chain of MHC class I (\f45 kDa). A. Synthesis of MHC class I heavy chains is inhibited during EBV replication. Cells were\nmetabolically labeled for 2 h as described in Materials and Methods and immunoprecipitated with W6/32 or r\u0005HC antibody. Samples were\nseparated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography of dried gels was performed using a PhosphorImager. B. The levels of newly synthesized MHC class\nI heavy chains are reduced during lytic replication. Equal numbers of GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells were either lysed directly in SDS-containing lysis buffer\nor labeled with [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine mix for 2 h and immunoprecipitated with W6/32 as described above. Total cell lysates (TCL) were\nseparated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose \ufb01lters, and probed for the heavy chain and actin speci\ufb01c antibody as a loading control.\nC. Rapid degradation does not appear to account for the decreased levels of newly synthesized heavy chains. Cells were labeled with [35S]me-\nthionine-[35S]cysteine mix for 2 min and incorporation of radioactivity was terminated by the addition of 1 mM of nonradioactive L-methionine\nand L-cysteine. Samples were pelleted and frozen either immediately (time zero) or after 5 and 30 min of chase, followed by sequential\nimmunoprecipitation with W6/32 and r\u0005HC antibody. Electrophoresis and autoradiography were performed as described above. D. Inhibitors of\nproteasomal or lysosomal degradation do not recover expression of newly synthesized heavy chains. Cells were incubated in methionine- and\ncysteine-free DMEM for 1 h in the presence of both proteasomal inhibitor lactacysin (10 \u0003M) and lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (4 \u0003M), labeled\nfor 20 min with 400 \u0003Ci [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine followed by sequential immunoprecipitation with W6/32 and r\u0005HC, electrophoresis, and\nautoradiography. E. MHC class I heavy chain and \u00022m mRNA are reduced in cells in lytic replication. After sorting, GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells were\ncarefully counted and pellets of equal numbers of cells were used for reverse transcription and RT-PCR analysis of MHC class I and \u00022m mRNA.\nValues of relative expression of these mRNAs in GFP\u0001 relative to GFP\u0006 cells are shown. Means and standard deviations of three independent\nexperiments. F. Inhibition of protein synthesis mimics the effect of lytic replication on downregulation of assembled surface MHC class I and class\nII molecules. Akata Bx1g cells were either cultured in control medium, treated with 50 \u0003g/ml cycloheximide or induced into lytic cycle for 24 h\nand then stained for surface MHC class I and II. The expression levels of MHC class I and II on both GFP\u0001 and cycloheximide-treated cells are\nshown as percentages relative to those in GFP\u0006 or untreated cells, respectively. G. Assembled MHC class I molecules synthesized in lytically\ninfected cells are delayed in their maturation. Cells metabolically labeled for 30 min were incubated in prewarmed DMEM containing excesses of\nunlabeled L-methionine and L-cysteine and 10% fetal calf serum. Samples were collected immediately after the pulse (time zero) and at 1 h or 2 h\nof incubation. After immunoprecipitation with W6/32, assembled MHC class I was eluted from the Sepharose beads, digested by endoH (2 mM)\nand separated by SDS-PAGE together with nondigested controls. The line graph shows ratios between the intensities of endoH-resistant\nand -sensitive bands in GFP\u0001 and GFP\u0006 cells.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS I DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1397\n\nexpression levels could not be used to assess the abundance of\nMHC class I and \u00022m mRNAs. Instead, normalization was\nachieved by extracting mRNA from equal numbers of sorted\nGFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells. As shown in Fig. 5E, the mRNA mes-\nsage for MHC class I was reduced by an average of 70%,\nwhereas the \u00022m message was reduced by approximately 60%.\nTo test directly whether global inhibition of protein synthesis\ncan cause MHC class I downregulation in Akata Bx1g cells\nwithin the timeframe of experiments performed in this study,\ncells were either treated to induce the lytic cycle or incubated\nwith 50 \u0003g/ml of cycloheximide for 24 h (Fig. 5F). GFP\u0001 cells\nwere compared to anti-Ig-treated GFP\u0006 cells, while untreated\ncells served as a control for cycloheximide-treated cells. EBV\nreplication and inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide\nresulted in comparable reduction of MHC class I and class II\nexpression.\nInhibition of TAP-mediated peptide translocation into the\nER during EBV replication has been previously suggested\n(29). Our results revealed a slight inhibition of TAP2 expres-\nsion as well as downregulation of TPPII and ERp57 in cells\nreplicating the virus. All these changes could decrease the\nef\ufb01ciency of peptide supply and loading in lytically infected\ncells, thereby affecting the kinetics of MHC class I progression\nthrough the ER and Golgi apparatus. To assess the ef\ufb01ciency\nof this process, Akata Bx1g cells were induced, sorted, labeled\nfor 30 min with [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine, and chased at\nthe indicated time points after the pulse. After immunopre-\ncipitation with W6/32 antibodies, samples were divided and\neither mock treated or treated with endoH, an enzyme which\nremoves N-linked oligosaccharides attached to proteins in the\nER but does not trim modi\ufb01ed versions of these sugars ac-\nquired in the Golgi compartment. It has been previously dem-\nonstrated that the kinetics of MHC class I maturation is rela-\ntively slow in Akata cells due to their intrinsically low TAP\nactivity (10, 17). Accordingly, a proportion of MHC class I\nmolecules remained endoH sensitive even after 2 h of chase in\nthe control GFP-negative cells (Fig. 5G). In agreement with\nthe previous experiments, bands of very low intensity were\ndetected in MHC class I immunoprecipitates from the lysates\nof GFP\u0001 Akata Bx1g cells. Although it was clear that MHC\nclass I molecules in cells replicating EBV progress to the Golgi,\ndensitometry of endoH-sensitive and endoH-resistant bands\nindicated that there was a delay in MHC class I maturation\nduring the EBV lytic cycle. However, this delay was revealed\nonly upon a comparison of samples obtained at 2 h of chase\nand its signi\ufb01cance for the phenomenon of MHC class I down-\nregulation remains unclear.\nDISCUSSION\nStudy of EBV replication was hampered for a long time by\nthe lack of a permissive in vitro system. We hereby present a\nmodel for studying EBV replication that is based on a recom-\nbinant virus which drives GFP expression in infected cells\nduring the lytic cycle, enabling us to distinguish and sort cells\nsupporting virus replication from cells that remain in latency.\nWe found that, at least in Akata Bx1g cells, GFP expression,\ndriven by the immediate-early CMV promoter from a cassette\ninserted into the thymidine kinase gene of the EBV genome,\nlargely coincides with expression of early and late lytic cycle\ngenes. The fact that high levels of GFP expression in Akata\nBx1g cells are observed only upon induction of the lytic cycle is\nmost likely explained by upregulation of the CMV promoter\nactivity or regulatory effects of the two thymidine kinase pro-\nmoters which lie upstream of the CMV promoter in the re-\ncombinant EBV strain and become activated in cells support-\ning EBV replication. An increase in EBV copy numbers during\nthe lytic cycle is unlikely to contribute to this phenomenon,\nbecause inhibition of EBV DNA synthesis by acyclovir does\nnot signi\ufb01cantly affect GFP expression in anti-Ig-stimulated\nAkata cells. In the present study, we utilized this model to\nanalyze the in\ufb02uence of the EBV lytic cycle on the MHC class\nI processing and presentation pathway. We observed that EBV\nreplication results in MHC class I downregulation at the cell\nsurface of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma Akata cells, as well as the epi-\nthelial cell lines AGS and HCT116, infected with the recom-\nbinant EBV strain (Fig. 1). Kinetic analysis of viral gene ex-\npression in Akata cells indicated that the MHC class I\ndownregulation precedes the expression of late genes of the\nEBV lytic cycle. Accordingly, treatment with acyclovir, which\nblocks late EBV gene expression and virus DNA replication,\ndid not prevent MHC class I downregulation in cells expressing\nGFP and BZLF1 following anti-Ig cross-linking (Fig. 2). It is\nnot surprising that the recombinant virus retains sensitivity to\nacyclovir even though its thymidine kinase gene is disrupted,\nbecause EBV thymidine kinase does not phosphorylate acyclo-\nvir and the effect of this drug is determined by the exquisite\nsensitivity of the viral DNA polymerase to phosphorylated\nacyclovir presumably generated by cellular or other viral ki-\nnases (12, 26).\nMHC class I downregulation in the course of EBV replica-\ntion observed in our model recapitulates recent \ufb01ndings by\nRessing et al., who characterized this phenomenon by using\nEBV-positive Akata cells transfected with a reporter plasmid\nin which expression of the extracellular and transmembrane\ndomains of the rat CD2 molecule, with GFP replacing the\nfunctional cytosolic domain, is driven by the early BZLF1-\nresponsive promoter (29). Here we extend this \ufb01nding towards\nmore extensive characterization of the MHC class I-processing\npathway during the course of EBV replication. We demon-\nstrate that the expression levels of MHC class I molecules\nencoded by each of the three loci, A, B, or C, are decreased to\nsimilar extents on the surface of cells in the lytic cycle (Fig.\n1D). This correlates with signi\ufb01cantly decreased levels of MHC\nclass I heavy chains and \u00022m in total cell lysates (Fig. 3 and 4).\nInterestingly, Ressing et al. have not observed any modulation\nof heavy chain levels in their model of EBV replication (29).\nThis discrepancy can be partly explained by the fact that in the\nprevious study, cells replicating the virus were compared to\nuntreated cells in culture, while we observed a signi\ufb01cant MHC\nclass I upregulation on the surface of cells which were sub-\njected to lytic cycle-inducing stimuli, e.g., anti-Ig antibody, but\nremained in latency (Fig. 1B). Therefore, in our analysis, we\nalways compared cells in the lytic cycle to similarly treated cells\nin latency obtained by sorting the same cell culture into GFP\u0001\nand GFP\u0006 populations. In contrast to the changes observed in\nthe total pool of heavy chains, free heavy chains accumulated\nin cells supporting EBV replication (Fig. 3B). In activated\nhuman T cells, MHC class I molecules coexist in two confor-\nmation states, folded and misfolded, and can be identi\ufb01ed by\n1398\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nthe monoclonal antibodies W6/32 and HC10, respectively. In\nthese cells, the pool of misfolded heavy chains is found in\nassociation with calreticulin and ERp57 (3, 30). Our results\npoint to a possible role of both calreticulin and calnexin in\nstabilizing different pools of free heavy chains. Although cal-\nreticulin and, to a lesser extent, calnexin accumulate on the\nsurface of cells supporting the virus lytic cycle, the levels of\ncalreticulin in total cell lysates are reduced, whereas calnexin is\nincreased (Fig. 4). This suggests that a proportion of free heavy\nchains could be stabilized by calnexin intracellularly, whereas\ncalreticulin aids their stabilization at the surface. It is also\npossible that some free heavy chains associated with chaper-\nones and especially with calreticulin acquire a folded confor-\nmation, which is seen by the W6/32 antibody. That could ex-\nplain why \u00022m seems to be downregulated to a greater extent\nthan assembled MHC class I molecules in cells replicating the\nvirus (Fig. 3B).\nAlthough it has been suggested that free heavy chains and\nMHC class I molecules devoid of peptides can interact with\nNK cell receptors and modulate the functional outcome of\ntarget cell recognition by NK cells (2, 7, 22), it remains to be\nestablished whether the accumulation of free MHC class I\nheavy chains at the cell surface serves any immunological func-\ntion in cells replicating EBV.\nCalreticulin is found in the ER membrane, the nucleus, and\non the cell surface of most mammalian cells. Cellular stress,\nincluding apoptosis, induces expression of calreticulin and\nleads to an increase of its cell surface expression and redistri-\nbution, whereby calreticulin becomes associated with phospha-\ntidylserine (11). At least in part, the surface accumulation of\ncalreticulin could be a re\ufb02ection of apoptotic changes associ-\nated with EBV replication but could also have different func-\ntional implications. Calreticulin has been shown to interact\nwith perforin and inhibit perforin-mediated killing. This pro-\ntection seems to occur independently of direct interaction with\nperforin, and it has been proposed that calreticulin stabilizes\nthe membrane and prevents pore formation induced by per-\nforin (9). Although MHC class I downregulation may lead to\nincreased sensitivity of cells to NK lysis (20), functional con-\nsequences of EBV replication in terms of its effect on recog-\nnition by CTLs or NK cells remain to be characterized, and\ncalreticulin could affect perforin-mediated lysis of EBV-in-\nfected cells during the lytic cycle.\nPulse-chase analysis of MHC class I molecules in cells rep-\nlicating EBV showed a strong reduction in the levels of newly\nmade heavy chains and \u00022m (Fig. 5). Targeting proteins for\ndegradation is a common strategy utilized by herpesviruses to\nensure their persistence and/or escape from immune surveil-\nlance (see reference 27 for a review). In particular, cytomeg-\nalovirus encodes at least two proteins, US2 and US11, which\ntarget MHC class I heavy chains for retrograde transport from\nthe ER to cytosol (21, 35). A decrease in the amount of newly\nmade heavy chains was clearly detected after brief metabolic\nlabeling and could not be rescued by a combination of protea-\nsomal and lysosomal inhibitors, strongly suggesting that target-\ning of heavy chains for protein degradation does not play a role\nin the observed MHC class I downregulation (Fig. 5C and D).\nRessing et al. have shown that the functional activity of the\nTAP heterodimer is inhibited during EBV replication, al-\nthough the expression of TAP1 and TAP2 appeared to be\nunaffected (29). In our system, expression of TAP2, but not\nTAP1, was decreased by about 30% in cells supporting virus\nreplication (Fig. 4). We also observed downregulation of\nERp57, another functionally important member of the peptide\nloading complex, and TPPII, an endopeptidase implicated in\nthe generation of peptide ligands presented by MHC class I\nmolecules. These changes could, indeed, result in a lower ef-\n\ufb01ciency of MHC class I assembly, which is usually re\ufb02ected in\ndelayed class I maturation, as assessed by changes in the\nendoH sensitivity of sugars attached to these molecules and\nmodi\ufb01ed during their progression from the ER to the Golgi\ncompartment. We detected a delay in MHC class I maturation\nduring the EBV lytic cycle in Akata cells; however, this delay\nwas revealed only upon comparison of samples obtained at 2 h\nof chase (Fig. 5G), and its signi\ufb01cance for the phenomenon of\nMHC class I downregulation remains unclear. It is conceivable\nthat strong inhibition of MHC class I heavy chain synthesis\nobserved during EBV replication minimizes competition of\nnewly produced heavy chains for available peptide ligands,\neven if the latter are supplied at a decreased rate due to\ninhibition of the TAP heterodimer. Whether inhibition of TAP\nfunction plays a more signi\ufb01cant role at a particular stage of\nthe virus lytic cycle remains to be determined.\nNonspeci\ufb01c inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide\ncauses downregulation of MHC class I comparable to that\nobserved in Akata cells during the EBV lytic cycle (Fig. 5F).\nThe notion that the inhibition of MHC class I heavy chain and\n\u00022m synthesis plays the primary role in MHC class I down-\nregulation in the course of EBV replication is consistent with\na recent demonstration of skewing of EBV lytic cycle-speci\ufb01c\nCTL responses towards the immediate-early and early proteins\n(28). In this scenario, the immediate-early and early proteins\ncould be still processed and presented before the virus-induced\ninhibition of protein synthesis comes into force and the existing\npool of nonassembled heavy chains and \u00022m gets depleted. A\ndetailed discussion of mechanisms which could account for the\ninhibition of MHC class I synthesis by the immediate-early or\nearly proteins of the EBV lytic cycle is outside the scope of this\narticle. It has been proposed that the activity of LMP1, which\ninduces the IRF7 transcription factor and upregulates MHC\nclass I expression (37, 38), can be counteracted by BZLF1\nthrough its interference with IRF7 (14). MHC class I upregu-\nlation induced by B-cell-receptor triggering involves NF-\rB\nand can also be counteracted by BZLF1 through its interfer-\nence with the NF-\rB p65 subunit (13, 25). However, these\nmechanisms do not seem to be suf\ufb01cient, because the level of\nclass I synthesis in cells replicating EBV is much lower than\nthat in noninduced control Akata cells, which have not re-\nceived an activating signal and do not express LMP1. Other\nmechanisms may be at play in inhibiting basic transcription of\nMHC class I molecules and potentially include BZLF1-depen-\ndent inhibition of transcription factors such as CREB and TBP\n(1, 23), as well as inhibition of nuclear export of spliced cellular\nmRNAs by BMLF1 (4, 33). Regardless of the speci\ufb01c molec-\nular event(s) involved in this phenomenon, our data strongly\nsuggest that virus-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis\nthrough reduction of mRNA expression is the major mecha-\nnism of MHC class I downregulation during the EBV lytic\ncycle.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS I DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1399\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by grants awarded to V.L. by the Swedish\nCancer Society, Swedish Children Cancer Foundation, and IRIS Cen-\nter of the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research.\nWe thank Lindsey Hutt-Fletcher (Louisiana State University,\nShreveport, LA) for providing us with the recombinant EBV strain and\nEBV-infected cell lines.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Here we show that in several cell lines infected with a\nrecombinant EBV strain encoding green \ufb02uorescent protein (GFP), the virus lytic cycle coincides with GFP\nexpression, which thus can be used as a marker of virus replication. EBV replication resulted in downregu-\nlation of MHC class 1I and all classical MHC class 1 alleles independently of viral DNA synthesis or late gene\nexpression. Although assembled MHC class 1 complexes, the total pool of heavy chains, and \u00012-microglobulin\n(\u00012m) were signi\ufb01cantly downregulated, free class 1 heavy chains were stabilized at the surface of cells\nreplicating EBV. Calnexin expression was increased in GFP\u0002 cells, and calnexin and calreticulin accumulated\nat the cell surface that could contribute to the stabilization of class 1 heavy chains. Decreased expression levels\nof another chaperone, ERp57, and TAP2, a transporter associated with antigen processing and presentation,\ncorrelated with delayed kinetics of MHC class 1 maturation. Levels of both class 1 heavy chain and \u00012m mRNA\nwere reduced, and metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated a very low rate of class 1 heavy chain synthesis\nin lytically infected cells. MHC class 1 and MHC class 1I downregulation was mimicked by pharmacological\ninhibition of protein synthesis in latently infected cells. Our data suggest that although several mechanisms\nmay contribute to MHC class 1 downregulation in the course of EBV replication, inhibition of MHC class 1\nsynthesis plays the primary role in the process.\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human gammaherpesvirus,\nwhich causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with a\nnumber of malignancies arising from B cells, epithelial cells,\nand other cell lineages. EBV establishes latent infection pre-\ndominantly, if not exclusively, in B lymphocytes, but virus rep-\nlication can occur in both B lymphocytes and epithelial cells of\nthe oropharynx. 1n the course of virus replication, approxi-\nmately 70 lytic cycle proteins are expressed in EBV-infected\ncells in three temporal stages: immediate early (IE), early, and\nlate. Entry into the lytic cycle is triggered by expression of\neither of the two 1E genes BZLF1 and BRLF1. Both the\nBZLF1 and BRLF1 proteins function as transcriptional acti-\nvators and initiate the ordered cascade of viral lytic gene\nexpression culminating in the release of infectious virus (re-\nviewed in reference 18).\nThe majority of EBV carriers mount strong cytotoxic T-\nlymphocyte (CTL) responses speci\ufb01c to EBV lytic cycle anti-\ngens (5, 6, 15). EBV-speci\ufb01c CTLs appear to play the most\nimportant role in the immunological control of EBV replica-\ntion and EBV-induced malignant transformation. CTLs recog-\nnize their target cells through major histocompatibility com-\nplex (MHC) class 1 molecules loaded with antigen-derived\npeptides. Peptide ligands are generated in the cytosol by the\nproteolytic action of the proteasome and trimming peptidases\nand then translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by\nheterodimeric transporters associated with antigen presenta-\ntion 1 and 2 (TAP1 and TAP2). 1n the ER, MHC class 1 heavy\nchains interact with the chaperone calnexin, followed by inter-\naction with the chaperones calreticulin, ERp57, and \u00022-micro-\nglobulin (\u00022m) and a preformed complex of TAPs and tapasin.\nThis peptide loading complex is essential for ef\ufb01cient assembly\nof MHC class 1 complexes and their egress from the ER\nthrough the Golgi to the cell surface (reviewed in reference 8).\nTo escape from CD8\u0001 T-cell recognition and destruction, vi-\nruses have developed strategies to inhibit the expression of MHC\nclass 1. These mechanisms include transcriptional downregulation\nof the heavy chain expression, interference with antigen process-\ning by the proteasome, blocking of peptide transport into the ER,\ndislocation of MHC class 1 heavy chains from the ER to the\ncytosol for subsequent degradation, retention of MHC class 1 in\nthe ER, and targeted degradation of class 1 from post-ER com-\npartments. Several of these strategies for herpes simplex virus,\nvaricella-zoster virus, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus,\nand most notably cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been dissected\nin detail previously (reviewed in references 19 and 36).\nEBV replication also results in downregulation of MHC\nclass 1 molecules at the surface of infected cells.

Previous\nstudies have shown that in lymphoblastoid cell lines, the EBV\nlytic cycle and MHC class 1 downregulation are paralleled by\ndownregulation of MHC class 1I, CD40, and CD54 while\nCD19, CD80, and CD86 are not affected, pointing to a possible\nspeci\ufb01city of the process (16). Reduction of MHC class 1 ex-\npression was found to be an early lytic cycle event that was not\ndependent on viral DNA replication. The immediate-early\nBZLF1 protein was implicated in MHC class 1 downregulation\nin lymphoblastoid cell lines through inhibition of latent mem-\nbrane protein 1 (LMP1), which upregulates MHC class 1 ex-\npression in cells latently infected by EBV and is also expressed\nthroughout the lytic cycle. A more ef\ufb01cient system has been\ndeveloped recently to study EBV replication based on trans-\nfection of EBV-positive Akata cells with a reporter which is\nexpressed during the lytic cycle, allowing identi\ufb01cation and\nisolation of cells supporting virus replication from those in\nlatency (29). Experiments performed with this model revealed\nthat the capacity of the TAP1/TAP2 heterodimer to translo-\ncate peptides into the ER is inhibited by up to 70% during\nEBV replication, and because the expression of MHC class 1\nheavy chains was found to be unaltered, it was suggested that\nthis mechanism plays the primary role in downregulation of\nMHC class 1 molecules in the course of EBV replication (29). 1n this study, we made use of a similar model based on a\nrecombinant Akata virus carrying a cassette expressing green\n\ufb02uorescent protein (GFP) and the neomycin resistance gene\ninserted into the open reading frame of the nonessential thy-\nmidine kinase gene (34). We show that in these cells, the GFP\ngene is expressed during the lytic cycle with kinetics similar to\nthose of the early EBV lytic genes. Thus, cells expressing GFP\ncan be identi\ufb01ed, separated, and used for immunological or\nbiochemical analysis of changes caused by virus replication in\nEBV-infected cells. Our results show that even though multi-\nple mechanisms might operate during EBV lytic replication,\ninhibition of MHC class 1 heavy chains and \u00022m synthesis is\none of the key mechanisms of EBV-induced MHC class 1\ndownregulation.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell lines and induction of EBV replication. The Bx1g variants of the Burkitt\u2019s\nlymphoma cell line Akata (Akata Bx1g), the gastric carcinoma cell line AGS\n(AGS Bx1g), and the colorectal epithelial carcinoma cell line HCT116 (HCT116\nBx1g) were obtained by the infection of EBV-negative Akata, AGS, and HCT116\ncells with a recombinant virus originated from the EBV strain derived from the\nwild-type Akata cells. The recombinant virus was generated by introducing a\ncassette containing the neomycin resistance gene under the control of a thymi-\ndine kinase promoter and a modi\ufb01ed GFP gene under the control of the imme-\ndiate-early cytomegalovirus promoter into the open reading frame of the non-\nessential thymidine kinase gene (refer to reference 24 for more details on the\ngeneration of the virus). The Bx1g cell variants were grown in medium supple-\nmented with 500 \u0003g/ml of Geneticin sulfate (G418; Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis,\nMO). 1n Akata Bx1g cells, the EBV lytic cycle was induced by culturing in the\npresence of 50 \u0003g/ml goat F(ab\u0004)2 fragments speci\ufb01c to human immunoglobulin\nG (IgG; MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) for the indicated periods of time. The\nlytic cycle in AGS Bx1g and HCT116 Bx1g cells was induced by culturing for 24 h\nwith 30 ng/ml of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma Aldrich)\nand 0.5 mM sodium butyrate (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The chemicals were\nthen removed, and the culturing was continued for the indicated periods of time.\nAll cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with L-glutamine and 10%\nfetal calf serum.\nTo inhibit viral DNA replication and late lytic cycle gene expression or to block\nprotein synthesis, cells were cultured in the presence of 0.2 mM acyclovir\n(Alpharma, Oslo, Norway) or 50 \u0003g/ml cycloheximide (Sigma Aldrich), respectively.\nAntibodies. BZ.1 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) is a monoclonal antibody\n(MAb) speci\ufb01c to the immediate-early BZLF1 protein of EBV. 85K and 2L10\nare MAbs speci\ufb01c to the p85 early antigen of EBV and to the late envelope\nglycoprotein gp350/220, respectively. W6/32 (HB95; ATCC) is a pan-MHC class 1-speci\ufb01c MAb which recognizes heavy chains associated with \u00022m. r\u0005HC (rabbit\nanti-heavy chain) is a rabbit antiserum that recognizes free heavy chains of MHC\nclass 1 molecules encoded by the human leukocyte antigen A (HLA-A), B, or C\nlocus (32) and HC10 is a MAb that binds to a linear epitope exposed on free\nheavy chains of the HLA-B and -C loci (32). Both Abs were a kind gift of Hidde\nPloegh (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The anti-HLA-A (clone 108-\n2C5) and -HLA-B (clone Joan-1) MAbs were both from Lab Vision (Fremont,\nCA). The L31 Ab recognizes a linear \u00051 domain epitope exposed on free heavy\nchains of HLA-C (a kind gift of Louise Berg, Karolinska 1nstitute, Stockholm,\nSweden). Abs speci\ufb01c to ERp57 or calreticulin (both from StressGen, Victoria,\nCanada), calnexin (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), or tapasin (BD Bio-\nsciences) were used for both \ufb02ow cytometry and immunoblotting. Abs speci\ufb01c to\n\u00022m, clone TU\n\u00a8 99 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and TAP1 or TAP2 (BD\nBiosciences), as well as \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Ab against MHC\nclass 1, MHC class 1I, CD19, and CD86 (all from BD Biosciences) were used for\n\ufb02ow cytometry. Rabbit antiserum speci\ufb01c to \u00022m (Dako), Abs against the pro-\nteasomal subunits LMP2, LMP7, MECL1 (monoclonal antibodies), and \u00053 (rab-\nbit polyclonal) (Af\ufb01nity Research, Plymouth Meeting, PA) as well as GFP-\nspeci\ufb01c Ab (Roche, 1ndianapolis, 1N) or actin-speci\ufb01c Ab (Sigma Aldrich) were\nused only for immunoblotting. The tripeptidyl peptidase 1I (TPPII)-speci\ufb01c MAb\nwas from 1mmunesystem (Uppsala, Sweden). The TAP1- and TAP2-speci\ufb01c Abs\nused in immunoblotting were a kind gift from John Trowsdale (Cambridge 1nstitute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom). All antibody\npreparations used as isotype controls for \ufb02ow cytometry were purchased from\neither Dako or BD Biosciences. The goat anti-mouse allophycocyanin (APC)-\nconjugated antibody for indirect immunostaining was purchased from BD Bio-\nsciences. The relevant secondary antibodies for immunoblotting were purchased\nform Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden).\nFlow cytometry. At the indicated time points after induction, Akata Bx1g, AGS\nBx1g, or HCT116 Bx1g cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS), \ufb01xed for 25 min in Cyto\ufb01x/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences), washed three\ntimes in Perm/Wash solution (BD Biosciences), and blocked for 30 min on ice\nwith serum from an EBV-negative individual (5% in PBS). Samples were then\nincubated for 30 min on ice with primary unconjugated Abs, washed, and incu-\nbated with goat anti-mouse APC-conjugated Ab for an additional 30 min on ice.\nAll acquisitions were performed on a FACScalibur \ufb02ow cytometer and analyzed\nusing CellQuest (BD Biosciences). Double stainings were performed by labeling\ncells \ufb01rst with unconjugated BZLF1-speci\ufb01c Ab, whose binding was revealed by\nstaining with a relevant anti-mouse conjugate, as described above, followed by\nstaining with MHC class 1-, class 1I-, CD19-, or CD86-speci\ufb01c directly conjugated\nAb. Staining for HLA-C with L31 Ab, which recognizes free HLA-C heavy\nchains, was performed after the cells were treated for 2 min with a low-pH buffer\n(0.131 M citric acid, 0.066 M Na2HPO4, pH 3.3) to elute the peptides and\ndissociate the heavy chain from \u00022m.\nAnalysis of protein expression by immunoblotting. Akata Bx1g cells were\ninduced with 1gG-speci\ufb01c Abs for either 24 or 48 h and then sorted using a\nMoFlo sorter (Dako Cytomation) into GFP\u0001 and GFP\u0006 cells. 7AAD (BD\nBiosciences) was used to exclude dead cells during sorting. Cells were counted\nand pelleted, and the same numbers of GFP-positive cells and GFP-negative\ncells were lysed in reducing electrophoresis sample buffer (1 \u0007 106 cells/100 \u0003l).\nElectrophoresis was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gels or 8 to 16% poly-\nduramide gradient gels (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) and proteins were\ntransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Mem-\nbranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% skimmed milk and probed with\ndifferent primary Abs followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to horserad-\nish peroxidase. The signal was detected using Super Signal chemiluminescence\ndetection solution (Pierce, Rockford, 1L), and images were acquired on a LAS-\n3000 luminescent image analyzer (Fuji\ufb01lm Medical Systems, Stamford, CT).\nPulse-chase experiments, immunoprecipitation and MHC class 1 maturation.\nLytic cycle was induced in Akata Bx1g cells for 24 or 48 h, which were then sorted\ninto GFP\u0001 (lytic) and GFP\u0006 (latent), as described above. For metabolic labeling,\n2 \u0007 106 cells/sample were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, spun down, and resuspended in fresh\nprewarmed methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco\u2019s modi\ufb01ed Eagle\u2019s medium\n(DMEM) with 150 \u0003Ci of [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine (Redivue Pro-mix\nL-[35S] in vitro cell labeling mix; Amersham) and cultured for 2 h at 37\u00b0C.\nFor short pulse-chase experiments, cells were labeled for 2 min with 400 \u0003Ci\nRedivue Pro-mix. Labeling was terminated by the addition of nonradioactive\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS 1 DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1391\n\nL-methionine and L-cysteine (1 mM) (Sigma), and samples were pelleted and\nfrozen at time zero or at 5 and 30 min of chase.\nTo assess the role of protein degradation, cells were incubated in methionine-\nand cysteine-free DMEM at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of the proteasomal\ninhibitor lactacystine (10 \u0003M) and the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (4 \u0003M)\n(Sigma). Cells were labeled for 20 min with 400 \u0003Ci Redivue Pro-mix, washed,\nand then pelleted.\nFor the assessment of MHC class 1 maturation, cells were pulsed for 30 min,\nlabeling was terminated as described above, cells were washed once and reincu-\nbated in prewarmed DMEM containing excess unlabeled L-methionine and L-\ncysteine and 10% fetal calf serum. Samples were collected immediately after the\npulse (time zero) and at 1 h and 2 h of chase.\nSamples were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1\nmM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \ufb02uoride) on ice. After\n30 min, nuclei were removed by centrifugation (relative centrifugal force, 3,000;\n10 min). MHC class 1 molecules were immunoprecipitated with either W6/32 or\nr\u0005HC Abs after preclearing with mouse or rabbit serum, respectively.\nFor endo-\u0002-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endoH) digestion, immune com-\nplexes bound to protein A Sepharose beads were eluted by incubation at 95\u00b0C for\n5 min in elution buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate, 3 mM EDTA, 0.25% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate [SDS], pH 6.0). One half of each sample was digested overnight\nat 37\u00b0C with 2 mU endoH (Roche, Mamheim, Germany), and the other half was\nmock digested. Samples were mixed with reducing electrophoresis loading buffer\nand analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on a 10%\npolyacrylamide gel. Gels were \ufb01xed (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 5% glyc-\nerol), vacuum dried, and incubated in a Hypercassette (Amersham), and the\nsignal was revealed in a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, GE\nHealthcare).\nReal-time RT-PCR (RNA preparation and reverse transcription). After in-\nduction of the lytic cycle, Akata Bx1g cells were sorted into GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001\npopulations, carefully counted, and RNA was extracted from 1 \u0007 106 cells of\neach population according to the instructions of the QIAGEN RNA blood\nminikit (Hilden, Germany). RNA was eluted with 30 \u0003l of RNase-free water.\nThe cDNA synthesis was performed in a total volume of 50 \u0003l containing 30 \u0003l\nRNA, 1 \u0007 \ufb01rst-strand buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM\nMgCl2), 105 \u0003g/ml pdN6 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), 1 mM of each\ndeoxynucleoside triphosphate (Amersham Biosciences), 1 mM dithiothreitol,\n0.48 units/\u0003l RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), and 4.8 units/\u0003l Moloney murine\nleukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT; 1nvitrogen, Paisley, Scotland), at 37\u00b0C\nfor 1.5 h. The reaction was stopped by heating at 68\u00b0C for 15 min.\nReal-time PCR. A total of 2.5 \u0003l of cDNA was used in a 25-\u0003l reaction mixture\ncontaining 1\u0007 SYBR green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 300 nM\nof each primer. Primers and primer sequences were as follows: HLA class 1-F,\n5\u0004-ACC TGG AGA ACG GGA AGG A-3\u0004; HLA class 1-R, 5\u0004-TGT GAT CTC\nCGC AGG GTA GAA-3\u0004; \u00022m-F, 5\u0004-GAT GAG TAT GCC TGC CGT GTG-3\u0004;\n\u00022m-R, 5\u0004-CAA TCC AAA TGC GGC ATC T-3\u0004; G6PD-F, 5\u0004-TGC CCC CGA\nCCG TCT AC-3\u0004; G6PD-R, 5\u0004-ATG CGG TTC CAG CCT ATC TG-3\u0004; ABL-F,\n5\u0004-CGA AGG GAG GGT GTA CCA TTA C-3\u0004; ABL-R, 5\u0004-CGT TGA ATG\nATG ATG AAC CAA CTC-3\u0004. The PCR was performed and analyzed on the\nABI 7000 sequence detection system with the following PCR conditions: 50\u00b0C for\n2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 PCR ampli\ufb01cation cycles with 95\u00b0C for\n15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Relative quanti\ufb01cation of gene expression was calculated\naccording to the Delta-Delta CT method. The formula used was 2\b\tCT\n, where \tCT\nequals the cycle threshold (CT) of a given gene in GFP\u0001 cells minus the CT of the\nsame gene in GFP\u0006 cells.\nRESULTS\nAn alternative model for EBV lytic replication. Analysis of\nEBV lytic replication has been hampered by the lack of suit-\nable permissive systems of virus infection. Recently, Ressing et\nal. described a new experimental model of EBV replication\nbased on transfection of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma Akata cells with a\nplasmid encoding the rat CD2 extracellular and transmem-\nbrane domains, with the cytosolic domain replaced with GFP\n(29). Expression of the fusion protein in this construct is driven\nby the BMRF1 early gene promoter. Upon induction of the\nlytic cycle by cross-linking of surface immunoglobulins, trans-\nfected cells supporting virus replication could be either studied\nbased on their GFP expression or isolated with anti-rat CD2\nbeads (29).\nWe made use of an alternative system in which a cassette\nencoding the GFP gene under control of the CMV immediate-\nearly promoter was inserted into the open reading frame of the\nnonessential thymidine kinase gene of the wild-type Akata\nvirus (34). This recombinant virus was used to infect an EBV-\nnegative variant of the Akata cell line, the gastric carcinoma\ncell line AGS, and the colorectal epithelial carcinoma cell line\nHCT116, generating EBV-positive cell lines referred to as\nAkata Bx1g, AGS Bx1g, and HCT116 Bx1g, respectively.\nCultures of cells infected with the recombinant virus typi-\ncally contained a small population of cells in lytic replication\n(Fig. 1A, upper panels; data not shown for HCT116 Bx1g\ncells). 1n Akata Bx1g cells, the expression of the immediate-\nearly gene BZLF1 quite strictly coincided with expression of\nGFP, whereas both GFP single-positive and GFP/BZLF1 dou-\nble-positive populations could be clearly distinguished in AGS\nBx1g cells and HCT116 Bx1g cells before and after induction\nof the lytic cycle. This probably re\ufb02ects the higher steady-state\nactivity of the CMV promoter in epithelial cells. Upon induc-\ntion of the lytic cycle by surface 1gG cross-linking or TPA and\nsodium butyrate, the proportions of Akata Bx1g and AGS\nBx1g cells replicating EBV increased from approximately 2%\nto 40% and from 3% to 10%, respectively. 1n accordance with previous reports, cells supporting lytic\nreplication expressed decreased surface levels of MHC class 1\n(Fig. 1A, lower panels, and B) and MHC class 1I (Fig. 1C). 1nduction of the virus lytic cycle increased the number of cells\nwith low levels of surface MHC class 1 in Akata Bx1g, AGS\nBx1g (Fig. 1A and B, lower panels), and HCT116 Bx1g (data\nnot shown) cells, although the kinetics of this process was\nslower in the epithelial cells, with visible increase of the GFP/\nBZLF1 double-positive population only 48 h posttreatment\nand onwards. 1n our experimental model, 1g cross-linking or\nTPA-sodium butyrate treatment led to an increase in MHC\nclass 1 expression on the surface of cells that remained in\nlatency compared to that on control untreated cells (Fig. 1B,\nupper panels). This observation contrasts with the \ufb01ndings of\nRessing et al., who observed no difference in MHC class 1\nexpression between anti-Ig-treated and untreated cells latently\ninfected with the virus (29). Therefore, in all experiments, we\ncompared GFP\u0001 cells replicating the virus with the GFP\u0006\npopulation within the same cultures exposed to lytic cycle-\ninducing stimuli.\nTo exclude the possibility that the observed effect of virus\nreplication on MHC class 1 expression was caused by the ex-\npression of GFP or other unknown effects mediated by the\nrecombinant virus, wild-type Akata cells were induced to rep-\nlicate EBV and then costained with the BZLF1-speci\ufb01c anti-\nbody and one of the antibodies speci\ufb01c to MHC class 1, MHC\nclass 1I, CD19, or CD86 (Fig. 1C). As previously reported,\nsurface expression of CD19 and CD86 remained unchanged,\nwhereas levels of MHC class 1 and 1I were decreased in cells\nreplicating the virus. All classical MHC class 1 alleles were\ndownregulated by approximately 60% on average in lytically\ninfected Akata Bx1g cells as revealed by staining with antibod-\nies that recognize pan-HLA-A, pan-HLA-B, or pan-HLA-C\n(Fig. 1D).\nTo get an insight into the role of different EBV proteins in\n1392\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nFIG. 1. EBV lytic replication results in GFP expression and MHC class 1 downregulation in Akata Bx1g and AGS Bx1g cells. Akata cells\ncarrying a recombinant EBV strain with the GFP gene inserted under the immediate-early CMV promoter into the virus genome (Akata Bx1g\ncells) or AGS gastric epithelial cells infected with the same virus (AGS Bx1g cells) were treated as described in Materials and Methods to induce\nthe EBV lytic cycle. Staining with the indicated speci\ufb01c antibodies and \ufb02uorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis were performed as\ndescribed in Materials and Methods. A. EBV replication, GFP expression, and MHC class 1 downregulation coincide in Akata Bx1g and AGS Bx1g\ncells. To induce EBV replication, cells were cultured either with F(ab\u0004)2 fragments speci\ufb01c to human 1gG for the indicated periods of time (Akata\nBx1g) or with TPA and sodium butyrate (AGS Bx1g) for 24 h, washed, and incubated in standard culture medium for the remaining time of\ninduction. The four upper panels show intracellular staining for BZLF1. The lower panels show surface staining for MHC class 1 using W6/32\nantibody. 1n both cases, anti-mouse APC-conjugated antibody was used to detect binding of primary antibodies. The R1 and R2 regions in the\nlower panels de\ufb01ne two different cell populations, GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells, respectively, that were used for FACS analysis and cell sorting in this\nand all subsequent experiments. B. Signals used to activate the EBV lytic cycle in Akata or AGS cells induce overall upregulation of MHC class 1, which is overridden by virus replication. Surface staining for MHC class 1 was done with W6/32 antibody and APC-conjugated anti-mouse\nsecondary antibody. The upper panel shows the expression of MHC class 1 in the total population of either control (noninduced) or anti-IgG-\ntreated (Akata-induced) or TPA-butyrate-treated (AGS-induced) cells. The four lower panels show either control or induced cells, each divided\ninto GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 populations. The histograms are presented to illustrate the distribution of cells with different levels of MHC class 1\nexpression in cultures replicating the virus. C. Wild-type Akata cells downregulate MHC class 1 and MHC class 1I molecules upon induction of\nthe EBV lytic cycle. Wild-type EBV-positive Akata cells were incubated with F(ab\u0004)2 fragments speci\ufb01c to human 1gG for 24 h. 1ndirect\nintracellular staining for BZLF1 was followed by staining with directly conjugated MHC class 1-, class 1I-, CD19-, or CD86-speci\ufb01c antibody. Cells\nwere gated as BZLF1 positive (pos) or BZLF1 negative (neg). The geometric means of \ufb02uorescence intensities (Geo MFI) of the gated populations\nare shown. D. HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles are downregulated to similar extents during EBV replication. At 24 h after induction, the levels of surface\nexpression of classical MHC class 1 molecules were assessed in Akata Bx1g cells with either a pan-MHC class 1-speci\ufb01c antibody (W6/32) or\nantibodies speci\ufb01cally recognizing HLA-A, -B, or -C alleles. The geometric means of \ufb02uorescence intensity obtained with each of the indicated\nantibodies for GFP-positive cells are shown as percentages relative to those of anti-IgG-treated GFP-negative (latent) cells (the means and\nstandard deviations of three experiments).\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS 1 DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1393\n\nthe downregulation of MHC class 1 expression, we \ufb01rst as-\nsessed the kinetics of this process in relation to the kinetics of\nexpression of immediate-early, early or late EBV proteins fol-\nlowing induction of the lytic cycle. The immediate-early gene\nBZLF1 was already expressed after 6 h of induction of the\nlytic cycle in Akata Bx1g cells (Fig. 2). Early gene expres-\nsion, assessed by staining for the EA-R protein, was unde-\ntectable at 6 h but picked up at 12 h, when virtually all cells\nexpressing immediate-early genes also expressed early genes\n(Fig. 2A). At this time point, a small proportion of cells\nalready expressed late genes, as assessed by staining for the\nenvelope glycoprotein gp350/220, but late gene expression\nby the majority of GFP\u0001 cells was seen only at 24 h. The\npercentage of cells that express lytic cycle genes peaked at\n24 h, followed by a decrease at 48 h, which could be due to\ncell death as a result of lytic replication. Surface MHC class 1 was slightly upregulated at 6 h postinduction in cells that\nexpressed BZLF1 in comparison to cells that were subjected\nto anti-Ig treatment but remained in latency. This upregu-\nlation was quickly reverted, and by 12 h, MHC class 1 was\nreduced by 20%; the extent of downregulation continued to\nincrease, reaching its peak at 48 h. The degree of downregu-\nlation varied between individual experiments but averaged\n60% by 48 h.\nThe fact that the surface levels of MHC class 1 were already\ndecreased by 12 h postinduction, as well as the fact that as-\nsembled molecules should have an average half-life of 6 to 8 h,\nsuggested that MHC class 1 downregulation is induced by an\nimmediate-early or early EBV proteins. 1n agreement with this\nassumption and previously published data (16), acyclovir\ngreatly decreased late gene expression in induced Akata cells\nand reduced percentages of cells expressing BZLF1 but did not\nsigni\ufb01cantly affect the levels of BZLF1 expression and MHC\nclass 1 downregulation in BZLF1-positive cells (Fig. 2B).\nFIG. 2. MHC class 1 downregulation is independent of virus DNA replication. A. MHC class 1 downregulation is an early event in the virus\nlytic cycle. The lytic cycle was induced in Akata Bx1g cells by 1gG cross-linking, and the levels of expression of immediate-early (BZLF1), early\n(EA-R-p85), and late (gp350/220) lytic cycle antigens were assessed by intracellular staining. 1n parallel, surface MHC class 1 was detected at each\ntime point after induction. Percentages of cells positive for each of the antigens at the indicated time points are shown on the left y axis, whereas\nthe relative MHC class 1 downregulation in GFP-positive cells compared with the GFP-negative cells is shown on the right y axis. B. MHC class 1 downregulation is independent of virus DNA replication and late gene expression. Akata Bx1g cells were induced by 1gG cross-linking in the\npresence or absence of 0.2 mM acyclovir. At the indicated time points, cells were collected and stained for intracellular BZLF1 or gp350/220\nexpression. The numbers inside the dot plots indicate percentages of cells in the relevant quadrants. Mean \ufb02uorescence intensity of BZLF1-speci\ufb01c\nstaining is shown for cells positive for both GFP and BZLF1. 1n parallel, samples were also stained for surface MHC class 1, and the percentage\nof MHC class 1 downregulation was assessed as described above. The results of this analysis are shown on the graph.\n1394\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nThe total pool of MHC class 1 heavy chains and \u00012m is\ndownregulated, whereas free heavy chains accumulate in cells\nreplicating EBV. To understand the fate of MHC class 1 in\ncells replicating EBV, we \ufb01rst asked whether the surface down-\nregulation of assembled molecules re\ufb02ected the overall de-\ncrease of heavy chain expression in these cells. Akata Bx1g\ncells were sorted into GFP\u0006 (latent) and GFP\u0001 (lytic) popu-\nlations at 48 h after induction. Western blot analysis of total\ncell lysates showed that lytic replication reduces the expression\nof MHC class 1 heavy chains as detected by two different heavy\nchain-speci\ufb01c antibodies (Fig. 3A). Levels of \u00022m were also\nstrongly reduced. 1n accordance with downregulation of assem-\nbled MHC class 1 at the cell surface (Fig. 1), cells subjected to\nsurface 1gG cross-linking but remaining in latency (GFP\u0006)\nexpressed slightly increased amounts of heavy chains in total\ncell lysates compared to noninduced controls (Fig. 4A). Cells\nin the lytic cycle had reduced levels of total heavy chains in\nFIG. 3. Free heavy chains accumulate during lytic replication.

B. Both surface and total pools of assembled MHC class 1 mol-\necules as well as \u00022m are downregulated during EBV replication while\nfree MHC class 1 heavy chains accumulate in lytically infected cells.\nThe upper panel shows density plots of Akata Bx1g cells 48 h after\ninduction, surface stained with W6/32 (for assembled MHC class 1),\nHC10 (for free MHC class 1 heavy chains), or TU\n\u00a8 99 (for \u00022m) anti-\nbodies obtained in one representative experiment.

N.D., not detected.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS 1 DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1395\n\ncomparison to either noninduced or induced but latently in-\nfected cells.\nNext, we studied the expression of assembled MHC class 1,\nfree heavy chains, and \u00022m both at the cell surface and in\npermeabilized cells, the latter re\ufb02ecting the total pool of the\nanalyzed molecules. The density plots in Fig. 3B show a typical\nsurface staining for these molecules at 48 h postinduction.\nBoth assembled MHC class 1 and \u00022m were decreased in\npermeabilized cells and on the surface of GFP\u0001 cells com-\npared to GFP\u0006 cells at 24 h postinduction, and this downregu-\nlation became more pronounced at 48 h (Fig. 3B). 1n contrast,\nthe levels of free heavy chain, detected by the MAb HC10,\nwere unchanged at 24 h and tended to increase at 48 h in lytic\ncells compared to those in cells in latency. Also, downregula-\ntion of \u00022m at the cell surface was statistically more signi\ufb01cant\n(P value in nonpaired t test, 0.01) than that of assembled MHC\nclass 1 after 48 h of lytic cycle induction. A stronger downregu-\nlation of \u00022m was also revealed upon staining of permeabilized\ncells after 24 h of induction (P value, 0.002). Taken together,\nthese results reveal that during EBV replication, expression\nlevels of both heavy chains and \u00022m are downregulated, and\n\u00022m seems to be reduced to a greater extent. At the same time,\nboth the total pool and surface fraction of free heavy chains are\nincreased, suggesting that free heavy chains selectively accu-\nmulate at the surface of cells supporting the lytic cycle.\nProteins that aid the generation of folded and peptide-\nloaded MHC class 1 are modulated during EBV lytic replica-\ntion. To investigate whether other mechanisms, in addition to\ndecreased expression of heavy chains and \u00022m, contribute to\nMHC class 1 downregulation in lytically infected cells, expres-\nsion of several components of the MHC class 1 processing\npathway in GFP\u0001 and GFP\u0006 Akata Bx1g cells was analyzed by\nimmunoblotting. GFP\u0006 cells were always negative for BZLF1\nexpression regardless of the time period between induction of\nthe lytic cycle and cell sorting (24 or 48 h). No signi\ufb01cant\nchanges could be observed in the expression of LMP2, LMP7,\nand MECL-1 subunits of the immunoproteasome (Fig. 4A),\nnor was there a change in the expression of the nonproteolytic\nconstitutive \u00053 proteasomal subunit. TPPII, another cytosolic\npeptidase implicated in the generation of MHC class 1 peptide\nepitopes, was slightly downregulated.\nTo compare the expression levels of peptide transporters\nand ER chaperones that play a role in the assembly and pep-\ntide loading of MHC class 1, both immunoblotting and \ufb02ow\ncytometry analysis of protein expression at the cell surface and\nin permeabilized cells were used as described for Fig. 3 and in\nMaterials and Methods. Signi\ufb01cant accumulation of calnexin\nwas observed mostly in the intracellular compartments of cells\nin the lytic cycle after 24 h of induction. 1n contrast, calreticulin\naccumulated on the surface, while its overall expression was\nreduced by up to 50% (Fig. 4). Expression of the chaperone\nERp57 showed a general reduction. Tapasin, TAP1, and TAP2\ncould not be detected at the cell surface by \ufb02ow cytometry, and\ntheir overall levels were not modulated signi\ufb01cantly, as de-\ntected by immunoblotting, with the exception of TAP2, whose\nexpression was decreased by approximately 30% (Fig. 4).\nMHC class 1 synthesis is reduced during lytic replication.\nHerpesviruses target MHC class 1 molecules for degradation\nthrough a number of mechanisms (31). Therefore, we investi-\ngated whether the decrease of MHC class 1 heavy chain ex-\npression in the course of EBV replication is due to inhibition\nof heavy chain synthesis or targeted protein degradation. 1n-\nduced and sorted Akata Bx1g cells were labeled with [35S]me-\nthionine and [35S]cysteine, and their lysates were immunopre-\ncipitated with W6/32 or r\u0005\u000bC antibodies speci\ufb01c to assembled\nMHC class 1 or free heavy chains, respectively. After 2 h of\nlabeling, most labeled heavy chains were associated with \u00022m\nand recovered with W6/32 antibody from control cells (Fig.\n5A). Comparison of GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells revealed a drastic\nreduction in 35S-labeled W6/32- and r\u0005HC-reactive molecules\nin cells replicating the virus. The amount of de novo-synthe-\nsized MHC class 1 molecules was strongly reduced, by approx-\nimately 85% in GFP\u0001 cells. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation\nof [35S]methionine-labeled cellular proteins revealed that cells\nin the lytic cycle incorporated the amino acid at 25% of the\nlevel of GFP\u0006 cells in latency (data not shown). This is con-\nsistent with overall inhibition of protein synthesis in cells rep-\nlicating the virus. However, heavy chain downregulation ob-\nserved by immunoblotting of total lysates of the same cells was\nrelatively moderate, reaching only about 40% reduction in\nband intensity (Fig. 5B).\nThese results could re\ufb02ect two non-mutually exclusive sce-\nnarios, that heavy chains are synthesized at a low rate or newly\nmade molecules are rapidly degraded. To address this ques-\ntion, we performed pulse-chase experiments on sorted cell\npopulations, in which cells were metabolically labeled for 2 min\nand chased immediately at time zero or 5 or 30 min postlabel-\ning. The cell lysates were sequentially immunoprecipitated\nwith W6/32 and r\u0005HC antibodies (Fig. 5C). 1n cells infected\nwith EBV latently, r\u0005HC-reactive molecules were visible at\ntime zero and their intensity decreased at the subsequent time\npoints, whereas the amount of assembled, W6/32-reactive\nMHC class 1 molecules increased over time. However, both\nW6/32- and r\u0005HC-reactive molecules were practically unde-\ntectable in cells replicating the virus, supporting the notion that\nthe rate of MHC class 1 synthesis is low during the EBV lytic\ncycle. This experiment still did not rule out completely the\npossibility that heavy chains are synthesized but degraded im-\nmediately. Therefore, we pretreated cells with a combination\nof lactacystin, a speci\ufb01c inhibitor of the proteasome, and chlo-\nroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation, and then per-\nformed metabolic labeling and sequential immunoprecipita-\ntion as described above (Fig. 5D). 1mmunoprecipitation of\nlysates of GFP\u0006 cells with the W6/32 and r\u0005HC antibodies\nshowed an accumulation of relevant protein moieties in cells\npretreated with the inhibitors. 1n contrast, neither W6/32- nor\nr\u0005HC-reactive species were revealed in cells replicating EBV\neven upon inhibition of protein degradation. 1mmunoprecipi-\ntation of \u00022m also performed in this series of experiments\ndemonstrated that its synthesis was inhibited in GFP\u0001 cells to\nan extent comparable to that observed for MHC class 1 heavy\nchains (data not shown).\nTo investigate whether decreased transcription/increased\nturnover of mRNA contributes to the decrease of MHC class 1 heavy chain synthesis, the abundance of mRNA message for\nthe classical MHC class 1 molecules and \u00022m was determined\nusing real-time RT-PCR analysis. Since CT values for mRNA\nof housekeeping genes (G6PD [glucose-6-phosphate dehydro-\ngenase] and Abl protein kinase genes) were increased in GFP\u0001\ncells (data not shown), normalization to housekeeping gene\n1396\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ.

Akata Bx1g cells were induced\nwith anti-IgG for either 48 h (A and B) or 24 h (C, D, E, F, and G) and then sorted into GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 populations. Both populations were\nincubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM prior to metabolic labeling. The bands shown in all experiments correspond\nto the heavy chain of MHC class 1 (\f45 kDa). A. Synthesis of MHC class 1 heavy chains is inhibited during EBV replication. Cells were\nmetabolically labeled for 2 h as described in Materials and Methods and immunoprecipitated with W6/32 or r\u0005HC antibody. Samples were\nseparated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography of dried gels was performed using a PhosphorImager. B. The levels of newly synthesized MHC class 1 heavy chains are reduced during lytic replication. Equal numbers of GFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells were either lysed directly in SDS-containing lysis buffer\nor labeled with [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine mix for 2 h and immunoprecipitated with W6/32 as described above. Total cell lysates (TCL) were\nseparated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose \ufb01lters, and probed for the heavy chain and actin speci\ufb01c antibody as a loading control.\nC. Rapid degradation does not appear to account for the decreased levels of newly synthesized heavy chains. Cells were labeled with [35S]me-\nthionine-[35S]cysteine mix for 2 min and incorporation of radioactivity was terminated by the addition of 1 mM of nonradioactive L-methionine\nand L-cysteine. Samples were pelleted and frozen either immediately (time zero) or after 5 and 30 min of chase, followed by sequential\nimmunoprecipitation with W6/32 and r\u0005HC antibody. Electrophoresis and autoradiography were performed as described above. D. 1nhibitors of\nproteasomal or lysosomal degradation do not recover expression of newly synthesized heavy chains. Cells were incubated in methionine- and\ncysteine-free DMEM for 1 h in the presence of both proteasomal inhibitor lactacysin (10 \u0003M) and lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (4 \u0003M), labeled\nfor 20 min with 400 \u0003Ci [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine followed by sequential immunoprecipitation with W6/32 and r\u0005HC, electrophoresis, and\nautoradiography.

F. 1nhibition of protein synthesis mimics the effect of lytic replication on downregulation of assembled surface MHC class 1 and class 1I molecules. Akata Bx1g cells were either cultured in control medium, treated with 50 \u0003g/ml cycloheximide or induced into lytic cycle for 24 h\nand then stained for surface MHC class 1 and 1I. The expression levels of MHC class 1 and 1I on both GFP\u0001 and cycloheximide-treated cells are\nshown as percentages relative to those in GFP\u0006 or untreated cells, respectively. G. Assembled MHC class 1 molecules synthesized in lytically\ninfected cells are delayed in their maturation. Cells metabolically labeled for 30 min were incubated in prewarmed DMEM containing excesses of\nunlabeled L-methionine and L-cysteine and 10% fetal calf serum. Samples were collected immediately after the pulse (time zero) and at 1 h or 2 h\nof incubation. After immunoprecipitation with W6/32, assembled MHC class 1 was eluted from the Sepharose beads, digested by endoH (2 mM)\nand separated by SDS-PAGE together with nondigested controls. The line graph shows ratios between the intensities of endoH-resistant\nand -sensitive bands in GFP\u0001 and GFP\u0006 cells.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS 1 DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1397\n\nexpression levels could not be used to assess the abundance of\nMHC class 1 and \u00022m mRNAs. 1nstead, normalization was\nachieved by extracting mRNA from equal numbers of sorted\nGFP\u0006 and GFP\u0001 cells. As shown in Fig. 5E, the mRNA mes-\nsage for MHC class 1 was reduced by an average of 70%,\nwhereas the \u00022m message was reduced by approximately 60%.\nTo test directly whether global inhibition of protein synthesis\ncan cause MHC class 1 downregulation in Akata Bx1g cells\nwithin the timeframe of experiments performed in this study,\ncells were either treated to induce the lytic cycle or incubated\nwith 50 \u0003g/ml of cycloheximide for 24 h (Fig. 5F). GFP\u0001 cells\nwere compared to anti-Ig-treated GFP\u0006 cells, while untreated\ncells served as a control for cycloheximide-treated cells. EBV\nreplication and inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide\nresulted in comparable reduction of MHC class 1 and class 1I\nexpression. 1nhibition of TAP-mediated peptide translocation into the\nER during EBV replication has been previously suggested\n(29). Our results revealed a slight inhibition of TAP2 expres-\nsion as well as downregulation of TPPII and ERp57 in cells\nreplicating the virus. All these changes could decrease the\nef\ufb01ciency of peptide supply and loading in lytically infected\ncells, thereby affecting the kinetics of MHC class 1 progression\nthrough the ER and Golgi apparatus. To assess the ef\ufb01ciency\nof this process, Akata Bx1g cells were induced, sorted, labeled\nfor 30 min with [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine, and chased at\nthe indicated time points after the pulse. After immunopre-\ncipitation with W6/32 antibodies, samples were divided and\neither mock treated or treated with endoH, an enzyme which\nremoves N-linked oligosaccharides attached to proteins in the\nER but does not trim modi\ufb01ed versions of these sugars ac-\nquired in the Golgi compartment. 1t has been previously dem-\nonstrated that the kinetics of MHC class 1 maturation is rela-\ntively slow in Akata cells due to their intrinsically low TAP\nactivity (10, 17). Accordingly, a proportion of MHC class 1\nmolecules remained endoH sensitive even after 2 h of chase in\nthe control GFP-negative cells (Fig. 5G). 1n agreement with\nthe previous experiments, bands of very low intensity were\ndetected in MHC class 1 immunoprecipitates from the lysates\nof GFP\u0001 Akata Bx1g cells. Although it was clear that MHC\nclass 1 molecules in cells replicating EBV progress to the Golgi,\ndensitometry of endoH-sensitive and endoH-resistant bands\nindicated that there was a delay in MHC class 1 maturation\nduring the EBV lytic cycle. However, this delay was revealed\nonly upon a comparison of samples obtained at 2 h of chase\nand its signi\ufb01cance for the phenomenon of MHC class 1 down-\nregulation remains unclear.\nDISCUSSION\nStudy of EBV replication was hampered for a long time by\nthe lack of a permissive in vitro system. We hereby present a\nmodel for studying EBV replication that is based on a recom-\nbinant virus which drives GFP expression in infected cells\nduring the lytic cycle, enabling us to distinguish and sort cells\nsupporting virus replication from cells that remain in latency.\nWe found that, at least in Akata Bx1g cells, GFP expression,\ndriven by the immediate-early CMV promoter from a cassette\ninserted into the thymidine kinase gene of the EBV genome,\nlargely coincides with expression of early and late lytic cycle\ngenes. The fact that high levels of GFP expression in Akata\nBx1g cells are observed only upon induction of the lytic cycle is\nmost likely explained by upregulation of the CMV promoter\nactivity or regulatory effects of the two thymidine kinase pro-\nmoters which lie upstream of the CMV promoter in the re-\ncombinant EBV strain and become activated in cells support-\ning EBV replication. An increase in EBV copy numbers during\nthe lytic cycle is unlikely to contribute to this phenomenon,\nbecause inhibition of EBV DNA synthesis by acyclovir does\nnot signi\ufb01cantly affect GFP expression in anti-Ig-stimulated\nAkata cells. 1n the present study, we utilized this model to\nanalyze the in\ufb02uence of the EBV lytic cycle on the MHC class 1 processing and presentation pathway. We observed that EBV\nreplication results in MHC class 1 downregulation at the cell\nsurface of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma Akata cells, as well as the epi-\nthelial cell lines AGS and HCT116, infected with the recom-\nbinant EBV strain (Fig. 1). Kinetic analysis of viral gene ex-\npression in Akata cells indicated that the MHC class 1\ndownregulation precedes the expression of late genes of the\nEBV lytic cycle. Accordingly, treatment with acyclovir, which\nblocks late EBV gene expression and virus DNA replication,\ndid not prevent MHC class 1 downregulation in cells expressing\nGFP and BZLF1 following anti-Ig cross-linking (Fig. 2). 1t is\nnot surprising that the recombinant virus retains sensitivity to\nacyclovir even though its thymidine kinase gene is disrupted,\nbecause EBV thymidine kinase does not phosphorylate acyclo-\nvir and the effect of this drug is determined by the exquisite\nsensitivity of the viral DNA polymerase to phosphorylated\nacyclovir presumably generated by cellular or other viral ki-\nnases (12, 26).\nMHC class 1 downregulation in the course of EBV replica-\ntion observed in our model recapitulates recent \ufb01ndings by\nRessing et al., who characterized this phenomenon by using\nEBV-positive Akata cells transfected with a reporter plasmid\nin which expression of the extracellular and transmembrane\ndomains of the rat CD2 molecule, with GFP replacing the\nfunctional cytosolic domain, is driven by the early BZLF1-\nresponsive promoter (29). Here we extend this \ufb01nding towards\nmore extensive characterization of the MHC class 1-processing\npathway during the course of EBV replication. We demon-\nstrate that the expression levels of MHC class 1 molecules\nencoded by each of the three loci, A, B, or C, are decreased to\nsimilar extents on the surface of cells in the lytic cycle (Fig.\n1D). This correlates with signi\ufb01cantly decreased levels of MHC\nclass 1 heavy chains and \u00022m in total cell lysates (Fig. 3 and 4). 1nterestingly, Ressing et al. have not observed any modulation\nof heavy chain levels in their model of EBV replication (29).\nThis discrepancy can be partly explained by the fact that in the\nprevious study, cells replicating the virus were compared to\nuntreated cells in culture, while we observed a signi\ufb01cant MHC\nclass 1 upregulation on the surface of cells which were sub-\njected to lytic cycle-inducing stimuli, e.g., anti-Ig antibody, but\nremained in latency (Fig. 1B). Therefore, in our analysis, we\nalways compared cells in the lytic cycle to similarly treated cells\nin latency obtained by sorting the same cell culture into GFP\u0001\nand GFP\u0006 populations. 1n contrast to the changes observed in\nthe total pool of heavy chains, free heavy chains accumulated\nin cells supporting EBV replication (Fig. 3B). 1n activated\nhuman T cells, MHC class 1 molecules coexist in two confor-\nmation states, folded and misfolded, and can be identi\ufb01ed by\n1398\nGUERREIRO-CACAIS ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nthe monoclonal antibodies W6/32 and HC10, respectively. 1n\nthese cells, the pool of misfolded heavy chains is found in\nassociation with calreticulin and ERp57 (3, 30). Our results\npoint to a possible role of both calreticulin and calnexin in\nstabilizing different pools of free heavy chains. Although cal-\nreticulin and, to a lesser extent, calnexin accumulate on the\nsurface of cells supporting the virus lytic cycle, the levels of\ncalreticulin in total cell lysates are reduced, whereas calnexin is\nincreased (Fig. 4). This suggests that a proportion of free heavy\nchains could be stabilized by calnexin intracellularly, whereas\ncalreticulin aids their stabilization at the surface. 1t is also\npossible that some free heavy chains associated with chaper-\nones and especially with calreticulin acquire a folded confor-\nmation, which is seen by the W6/32 antibody. That could ex-\nplain why \u00022m seems to be downregulated to a greater extent\nthan assembled MHC class 1 molecules in cells replicating the\nvirus (Fig. 3B).\nAlthough it has been suggested that free heavy chains and\nMHC class 1 molecules devoid of peptides can interact with\nNK cell receptors and modulate the functional outcome of\ntarget cell recognition by NK cells (2, 7, 22), it remains to be\nestablished whether the accumulation of free MHC class 1\nheavy chains at the cell surface serves any immunological func-\ntion in cells replicating EBV.\nCalreticulin is found in the ER membrane, the nucleus, and\non the cell surface of most mammalian cells. Cellular stress,\nincluding apoptosis, induces expression of calreticulin and\nleads to an increase of its cell surface expression and redistri-\nbution, whereby calreticulin becomes associated with phospha-\ntidylserine (11). At least in part, the surface accumulation of\ncalreticulin could be a re\ufb02ection of apoptotic changes associ-\nated with EBV replication but could also have different func-\ntional implications. Calreticulin has been shown to interact\nwith perforin and inhibit perforin-mediated killing. This pro-\ntection seems to occur independently of direct interaction with\nperforin, and it has been proposed that calreticulin stabilizes\nthe membrane and prevents pore formation induced by per-\nforin (9). Although MHC class 1 downregulation may lead to\nincreased sensitivity of cells to NK lysis (20), functional con-\nsequences of EBV replication in terms of its effect on recog-\nnition by CTLs or NK cells remain to be characterized, and\ncalreticulin could affect perforin-mediated lysis of EBV-in-\nfected cells during the lytic cycle.\nPulse-chase analysis of MHC class 1 molecules in cells rep-\nlicating EBV showed a strong reduction in the levels of newly\nmade heavy chains and \u00022m (Fig. 5). Targeting proteins for\ndegradation is a common strategy utilized by herpesviruses to\nensure their persistence and/or escape from immune surveil-\nlance (see reference 27 for a review). 1n particular, cytomeg-\nalovirus encodes at least two proteins, US2 and US11, which\ntarget MHC class 1 heavy chains for retrograde transport from\nthe ER to cytosol (21, 35). A decrease in the amount of newly\nmade heavy chains was clearly detected after brief metabolic\nlabeling and could not be rescued by a combination of protea-\nsomal and lysosomal inhibitors, strongly suggesting that target-\ning of heavy chains for protein degradation does not play a role\nin the observed MHC class 1 downregulation (Fig. 5C and D).\nRessing et al. have shown that the functional activity of the\nTAP heterodimer is inhibited during EBV replication, al-\nthough the expression of TAP1 and TAP2 appeared to be\nunaffected (29). 1n our system, expression of TAP2, but not\nTAP1, was decreased by about 30% in cells supporting virus\nreplication (Fig. 4). We also observed downregulation of\nERp57, another functionally important member of the peptide\nloading complex, and TPPII, an endopeptidase implicated in\nthe generation of peptide ligands presented by MHC class 1\nmolecules. These changes could, indeed, result in a lower ef-\n\ufb01ciency of MHC class 1 assembly, which is usually re\ufb02ected in\ndelayed class 1 maturation, as assessed by changes in the\nendoH sensitivity of sugars attached to these molecules and\nmodi\ufb01ed during their progression from the ER to the Golgi\ncompartment. We detected a delay in MHC class 1 maturation\nduring the EBV lytic cycle in Akata cells; however, this delay\nwas revealed only upon comparison of samples obtained at 2 h\nof chase (Fig. 5G), and its signi\ufb01cance for the phenomenon of\nMHC class 1 downregulation remains unclear. 1t is conceivable\nthat strong inhibition of MHC class 1 heavy chain synthesis\nobserved during EBV replication minimizes competition of\nnewly produced heavy chains for available peptide ligands,\neven if the latter are supplied at a decreased rate due to\ninhibition of the TAP heterodimer. Whether inhibition of TAP\nfunction plays a more signi\ufb01cant role at a particular stage of\nthe virus lytic cycle remains to be determined.\nNonspeci\ufb01c inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide\ncauses downregulation of MHC class 1 comparable to that\nobserved in Akata cells during the EBV lytic cycle (Fig. 5F).\nThe notion that the inhibition of MHC class 1 heavy chain and\n\u00022m synthesis plays the primary role in MHC class 1 down-\nregulation in the course of EBV replication is consistent with\na recent demonstration of skewing of EBV lytic cycle-speci\ufb01c\nCTL responses towards the immediate-early and early proteins\n(28). 1n this scenario, the immediate-early and early proteins\ncould be still processed and presented before the virus-induced\ninhibition of protein synthesis comes into force and the existing\npool of nonassembled heavy chains and \u00022m gets depleted. A\ndetailed discussion of mechanisms which could account for the\ninhibition of MHC class 1 synthesis by the immediate-early or\nearly proteins of the EBV lytic cycle is outside the scope of this\narticle. 1t has been proposed that the activity of LMP1, which\ninduces the 1RF7 transcription factor and upregulates MHC\nclass 1 expression (37, 38), can be counteracted by BZLF1\nthrough its interference with 1RF7 (14). MHC class 1 upregu-\nlation induced by B-cell-receptor triggering involves NF-\rB\nand can also be counteracted by BZLF1 through its interfer-\nence with the NF-\rB p65 subunit (13, 25). However, these\nmechanisms do not seem to be suf\ufb01cient, because the level of\nclass 1 synthesis in cells replicating EBV is much lower than\nthat in noninduced control Akata cells, which have not re-\nceived an activating signal and do not express LMP1. Other\nmechanisms may be at play in inhibiting basic transcription of\nMHC class 1 molecules and potentially include BZLF1-depen-\ndent inhibition of transcription factors such as CREB and TBP\n(1, 23), as well as inhibition of nuclear export of spliced cellular\nmRNAs by BMLF1 (4, 33). Regardless of the speci\ufb01c molec-\nular event(s) involved in this phenomenon, our data strongly\nsuggest that virus-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis\nthrough reduction of mRNA expression is the major mecha-\nnism of MHC class 1 downregulation during the EBV lytic\ncycle.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nMHC CLASS 1 DOWNREGULATION DURING EBV REPLICATION\n1399\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by grants awarded to V.L. by the Swedish\nCancer Society, Swedish Children Cancer Foundation, and 1RIS Cen-\nter of the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research.\nWe thank Lindsey Hutt-Fletcher (Louisiana State University,\nShreveport, LA) for providing us with the recombinant EBV strain and\nEBV-infected cell lines.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Recent studies\non norovirus receptors show that different noroviruses recognize different human histo-blood group antigens\n(HBGAs), and eight receptor binding patterns of noroviruses have been identi\ufb01ed. The P domain of the\nnorovirus capsids is directly involved in this recognition. To determine the precise locations and receptor\nbinding modes of HBGA carbohydrates on the viral capsids, a recombinant P protein of a GII-4 strain\nnorovirus, VA387, was cocrystallized with synthetic type A or B trisaccharides. Based on complex crystal\nstructures observed at a 2.0-\u00c5 resolution, we demonstrated that the receptor binding site lies at the outermost\nend of the P domain and forms an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with the saccharide ligand. The A and\nB trisaccharides display similar binding modes, and the common fucose ring plays a key role in this interac-\ntion. The extensive interface between the two protomers in a P dimer also plays a crucial role in the formation\nof the receptor binding interface.\nNoroviruses, a group of small, round-structured, RNA vi-\nruses within the Caliciviridae family, are widespread human\npathogens causing epidemic acute gastroenteritis (7). Norovi-\nruses contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of\nabout 7.7 kb organized into three open reading frames (ORFs)\n(10). ORF1 encodes a polyprotein precursor of several non-\nstructural proteins. ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major capsid\nprotein (VP1) and a minor structural protein (VP2), respec-\ntively. Recombinant VP1 self-assembles into empty virus-like\nparticles similar to the native capsid in size and appearance (9).\nThe function of VP2 remains unknown, although data suggest\nthat it enhances the expression and stability of the viral capsids\n(1). Since noroviruses are nonenveloped, their spherical capsid\nsurfaces contributed by VP1 contain structural determinants\nfor host cell recognition.\nThe crystal structure of the prototype Norwalk virus capsid\nhas been determined based on the evaluation of recombinant\nvirus-like particles produced in baculovirus (19). The capsid\nexhibits icosahedral symmetry (T\u00023) and consists of 90 dimers\nor 180 monomers of the capsid protein (20). Each of the capsid\nmonomers has two principle domains, the amino-terminal shell\n(S) domain and the carboxyl-terminal protruding (P) domain,\nlinked by an approximately 10-residue hinge (19). The S do-\nmain possesses an eight-stranded antiparallel \u0003 sandwich\nstructure and constitutes the interior icosahedral shell, and the\nP domain forms an arch-shaped protrusion emanating from\nthe shell. The S domain is responsible for the intermolecular\ninteraction of the viral capsid and alone can form smooth\nicosahedral particles, whereas the P domain is involved mainly\nin dimeric interactions to stabilize the capsid (2). The P do-\nmain can be further divided into two subdomains, P1 and P2\n(19). P1 is more interior and exhibits a fairly conserved se-\nquence, while P2 is located at the outer surface and exhibits a\nhighly variable primary sequence, indicating that P2 is respon-\nsible for host interaction.\nNoroviruses have been found to recognize human histo-\nblood group antigens (HBGAs) as receptors, and eight distinct\nreceptor binding patterns of noroviruses have been described\npreviously (5, 25). Human HBGAs are complex glycans\npresent on the surfaces of red blood cells, on the epithelia of\nthe gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, or as free antigens in\nbiologic \ufb02uids such as saliva, milk, and intestinal contents (15).\nHuman HBGAs are highly polymorphic, and three major\nHBGA families, namely, the Lewis, secretor, and ABO fami-\nlies, are involved in norovirus recognition. Based on the host\ngenetics of the three families, the eight receptor binding pat-\nterns of noroviruses can be sorted into two groups: the A/B and\nthe Lewis (nonsecretor) binding groups (6). Direct evidence\nlinking HBGAs to norovirus infections and illness has been\nobtained in volunteer studies with Norwalk virus, but such\nevidence for representatives of other receptor binding patterns\nremains lacking.\nFunctional analyses of norovirus capsids have been carried\nout in an attempt to map the receptor binding site and to\n* Corresponding author.

Neverthe-\nless, the exact locations of receptor binding sites are still spec-\nulative, which has hindered our ability to combat this widely\nspreading virus.\nWith a view towards understanding the details of the inter-\nactions between the P domain and the receptor oligosaccha-\nride, we have determined the crystal structures of the VA387 P\ndomain in complexes with trisaccharides from A and B types of\nHBGAs. Based on the structures of the VA387 P domain-\ntrisaccharide complexes, models for the interaction between\nHBGAs and other noroviruses are also proposed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nProtein expression, puri\ufb01cation, and crystallization. The expression construct\nwas made by cloning the cDNA sequence encoding the P domain plus the hinge\nregion of the VA387 norovirus into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Bio-\nscience), as described previously (23). Comparing the sequence of our construct\nwith the originally submitted VP1 sequence of VA387 (GenBank accession\nnumber AAK84679) revealed a conservative, double point mutation, Thr355 to\nSer and Phe375 to Leu, presumably due to the high mutation rate of the\nnorovirus RNA genome, but the expressed protein showed no detectable differ-\nence from the wild-type one in receptor binding (23). The puri\ufb01cation procedure\nfor the P protein from Escherichia coli was described previously (23), and the\npuri\ufb01ed P protein (i.e., residues 214 to 539) was concentrated to 12 mg/ml and\nstored in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mM NaCl in 100-\u0004l\naliquots at \u000580\u00b0C. The recombinant protein was crystallized by the hanging-drop\nvapor diffusion method at 16\u00b0C; the P protein solution was mixed with an equal\nvolume (1.5 \u0004l) of the precipitant solution, which contained 8% (wt/vol) poly-\nethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and 200 mM magnesium acetate. The best-diffract-\ning, plate-shaped crystals grew to their maximum size of 0.1 by 0.3 by 0.6 mm in\nabout 30 days. To determine the probable degradation of the P protein during\ncrystallization, a native P domain crystal was washed quickly with water, dis-\nsolved in water, and analyzed by mass spectrometry (by using an AXIMA-CFR\nplus instrument; Shimadzu). Following the success of the crystallization of the P\ndomain alone, the protein was cocrystallized with the blood group A trisaccha-\nride {\u0006-L-Fuc-(132)-[\u0006-D-GalNAc-(133)]-D-Gal; Sigma } and the B trisaccha-\nride {\u0006-l-Fuc-(132)-[\u0006-D-Gal-(133)]-D-Gal; Sigma } under crystallization con-\nditions similar to those described above. Molar excesses of the trisaccharide\nbetween 0 and 80-fold the amount of the protein were tested, and an optimal\nmolar excess for obtaining complex crystals was found to be about 65-fold.\nData collection and processing. For each of the native VA387 P domain and\ncomplex crystals, X-ray diffraction data were collected from a \ufb02ash-cooled crystal\non a Mar345 image plate (Mar-Research) after soaking the crystal in a cryopro-\ntectant solution. The cryoprotectant solution free of trisaccharide contained 8%\n(wt/vol) PEG 3350, 200 mM magnesium acetate, 15% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 5%\n(vol/vol) PEG 400. The data were processed, scaled, and merged using the\nHKL2000 program package (18).\nStructure determination and re\ufb01nement. Phases of the P protein crystal struc-\nture were solved by the molecular replacement method by using a fragment\nstructure (residues Phe218 to Arg530) of a single protomer from the Norwalk\nvirus capsid (Protein Data Bank identi\ufb01cation, 1IHM) (19) as the search model\nand the program Phaser (16); the molecular replacement solution had a Z score\nof 10.40 and an log likelihood gain of 72.12 (16). Residues that differ between the\nNorwalk virus capsid and the VA387 P protein were then replaced according to\nthe VA387 amino acid sequence, and manual adjustments were carried out with\nthe program O (11) guided by the difference electron density maps expressed\nby the following equations: (2Fo \u0005 Fc) and (Fo \u0005 Fc), where Fo is the observed\nstructure factor and Fc is the calculated structure factor. Multiple cycles of\nrebuilding and re\ufb01nement with the programs CNS (3) and O were then carried\nout. At the \ufb01nal stages of re\ufb01nement, a composite omission map was calculated\nto eliminate model bias, and water molecules with good hydrogen-bonding po-\ntentials were located in peaks (\u00072.5\b) of the (Fo \u0005 Fc) map. The upper B factor\nlimit was set to 200 \u00c52 in the re\ufb01nement. Data-processing and structural re\ufb01ne-\nment statistics are summarized in Table 1. The re\ufb01ned structures were evaluated\nwith the program PROCHECK (13); in all three re\ufb01ned structures, a single\nresidue, Asn373, was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot\nin the A-type complex, which appeared to be the result of direct interaction with\na nearby A trisaccharide molecule. The structural analysis was performed mainly\nby using the program EdPDB (29). The radii of both the probe and the solvent\nmolecule were assigned as 1.4 \u00c5.\nProtein Data Bank accession codes. The coordinates and structure factors for\nthe P protein (2OBR), the complex with A trisaccharide (2OBS), and the com-\nplex with B trisaccharide (2OBT) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank,\nResearch Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New\nBrunswick, NJ.\nRESULTS\nStructural overview. The recombinant P protein (i.e., resi-\ndues 214 to 539) of VA387, a Lordsdale-like GII-4 strain of\nnorovirus, was expressed and puri\ufb01ed from E. coli and crystal-\nlized. The native crystal structure was determined at a 2.2-\u00c5\nresolution by using the molecular replacement method. 1t be-\nlongs to the C2221 space group, with 1 protein molecule per\nasymmetric unit and a Matthews coef\ufb01cient (VM) of 2.2 \u00c53/Da\n(\t44% solvent content). Mass spectrometry analysis of the\ncrystal sample indicated that the crystallized protein had a\nmolecular mass of 34.4 kDa, compared with the calculated\n35.9-kDa molecular mass of the recombinant protein. This\nobservation suggested that the protein sample had been slowly\ndigested proteolytically during the crystallization process,\nwhich might be bene\ufb01cial for obtaining the high-quality crystal.\nFurthermore, residues Ala294 to His297, Thr371 to Asn373,\nand Asp391 to Asn393 in three loop regions could not be\nlocated on the electron density map when the P protein was\ncrystallized alone, yet they became well de\ufb01ned when either A\nor B trisaccharide was added. 1n addition, there was no inter-\npretable electron density for residues 531 to 535, indicating a\n\ufb02exible C terminus. The \ufb01nal model of the re\ufb01ned P domain\nmonomer contained residues Thr224 to Gly530, with dimen-\nsions of 44 by 49 by 64 \u00c5.\nSimilar to the Norwalk viral capsid, the P2 subdomain (res-\nidues 275 to 417) of VA387 appears to be an insertion in the P1\nsubdomain (residues 222 to 274 and 418 to 539) between\nGly274 and Ala418 (Fig. 1A and B), which are 4.6 \u00c5 apart as\nmeasured between their C\u0006 atoms. The P1 subdomain has two\ntwisted \u0003-sheets sharing strands \u00031 and \u00038 (Fig. 1B). Both\n\u0003-sheets consist of purely antiparallel \u0003 strands. The smaller\n\u0003-sheet has a strand order of \u00031-\u00038-\u000310, in which the amino\nterminus of \u00031 and the carboxyl terminus of \u00038 participate.\nThe larger \u0003-sheet has a strand order of \u000314-\u00031-\u00038-\u000313-\u000312-\n\u000311-\u000315, in which the carboxyl terminus of \u00031 and the amino\nterminus of \u00038 participate. There is only one well-de\ufb01ned \u0006\nhelix (\u00061, residues 454 to 463) in the entire P domain which is\nin the P1 subdomain and is involved in P domain homodimer-\nization. The two \u0003-sheets and the \u00061 helix plus the amino-\nterminal region (i.e., residues 227 to 237) contribute to the\nhydrophobic core of P1. The P2 subdomain features a six-\nstranded, antiparallel \u0003-barrel of a Greek key topology with a\nstrand order of \u00032-\u00033-\u00036-\u00035-\u00034-\u00037 and a well-packed hydro-\nphobic core. The P1 and P2 subdomains are cushioned by a\nrandom coil-dominated region without a signi\ufb01cant secondary\nstructure (Fig. 1A, left).\nThere are 26 (8.2%) proline residues in each P monomer; 19\nof them are conserved between VA387 and Norwalk virus,\naccounting for 16.4% of all the residues conserved between\nthese strains. 1n comparison, the average frequency of proline\n5950\nCAO ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nresidues in proteins from different species usually ranges be-\ntween 2.1 and 6.5% (27). 1n addition, 36% of backbone car-\nbonyl oxygen atoms and 24% of backbone amide groups in the\n\ufb01nal model hydrogen bond with crystallographically localized\nwater molecules (i.e., operationally de\ufb01ned as those within 3.3\n\u00c5) to satisfy their hydrogen bond potential. The high proline\nfrequency in the P domain and the extensive interactions of\nthis domain with water molecules may partially contribute to\nits stability at the low secondary-structure content (3% \u0006 he-\nlices and 29% \u0003 strands).\nP domain dimer. The P domain of VA387 forms a ho-\nmodimer with dimensions of 57 by 63 by 69 \u00c5. 1t comprises two\nasymmetric units related by the crystallographic two-fold a\naxis. The P dimer interface is formed mainly between the two\n\u0003-barrels in the P2 subdomains (between strands \u00035 and \u00039)\nand between the two dyad-related regions surrounding the \u00061\nhelices in the P1 subdomains (Fig. 1A, right). The dimer in-\nterface contains a large buried surface area twisted by \t60\u00b0\nfrom the \u00061-\u00061 region to the \u00035-\u00039 contact regions, which\ngreatly stabilizes the dimer structure.\nThe total area of the solvent-accessible surface (SAS) buried\nfrom each protomer during dimerization is about 1,800 \u00c52.\nThe contribution of nonpolar carbon atoms (52%) to the\ndimerization almost equals that of the polar atoms (48%),\nsuggesting that both hydrophobic and polar interactions are\nimportant to the dimerization. Alternatively, there are a total\nof 57 residues from each protomer having SAS\u2019s buried upon\ndimerization; among them, 14 are charged residues (i.e., Arg,\nLys, His, Asp, and Glu), 20 are noncharged polar residues (i.e.,\nSer, Thr, Asn, Gln, and Tyr), and the remaining 23 are hydro-\nTABLE 1.

Moreover, a total of 72 water molecules (36\nindependent molecules corresponding to each protomer) were\nfound in the P dimer interface (i.e., less than 6 \u00c5 from both P\ndomain protomers and with more than 70% of the SAS buried\nby the P dimer). Cleary, water molecules play critical roles in\nstabilizing the P domain dimerization.\nAlong the dyad axis, we can divide the dimer interface into\nfour layers (Fig. 1C). The top layer has a hydrophobic center\nand two hydrogen bond-rich regions. The hydrophobic center\nis formed by side chains of Met333, Lys348, Thr384, and\nVal386, and each hydrogen bond-rich region is formed by four\nintermolecular hydrogen bonds between \ufb01ve residues: Thr344\nN-Gly442 O (2.86 \u00c5), Thr344 O\u000b-Ser441 N (2.90 \u00c5), Thr344\nO\u000b-Gly442 O (2.92 \u00c5), and Ala346 N-Cys440 O (3.17 \u00c5).\nAround Arg345, there is an open cavity accessible to the re-\nceptor ligands with a size of about 10 by 8 by 4 \u00c5 (see below).\nThe remaining three layers are a water tunnel, a hydrophobic\nlayer (residues Pro243, Pro245, Ala280, and Val281), and a\nmixed hydrophilic center with two hydrophobic edges. 1nside\nthe symmetrical water tunnel in the dimer interface perpen-\ndicular to the dyad axis, with Glu274, Trp308, Thr337, and\nThr436 forming the entrance, about 20 transiently located wa-\nter molecules form a nearly continuous hydrogen-bonding net-\nwork with the surrounding amino acid residues. The hydro-\nphilic center of the fourth layer is formed by side chains of\nSer238, Ser279, Glu455, Gln458, His459, and Glu463 as well as\na number of buried water molecules, and each of the two\nhydrophobic edges is formed by 1le231, Leu232, and Leu278.\nP domain-trisaccharide complex. The crystal forms of the P\nprotein in complex with either the A or B trisaccharide\n(Fig. 2A and B) had an improved resolution (2.0 \u00c5) and were\notherwise isomorphous to that of the P domain in the absence\nof an oligosaccharide. The fucose (\u0006-Fuc) and galactose (\u0003-\nGal) rings shared by the A and B trisaccharides were clearly\nvisible at the \u00012.8\b contour level in [FO(complex) \u0005 FO(native)]\ndifference electron density maps phased with the protein\nmodel alone. All three saccharide rings in the trisaccharides\nwere modeled as chair conformations. Between the two trisac-\ncharides, the B trisaccharide was better de\ufb01ned in the electron\ndensity map (Fig. 2C), and the results presented below are\nbased mainly on data from the B-type complex. 1t is pertinent\nto note, however, that the overall ligand binding modes were\nalmost identical between the two complex crystals; there were\nno signi\ufb01cant features (at \f2.8\b levels) in an [FO(A complex) \u0005\nFO(B complex)] difference electron density map.\nBoth A and B trisaccharides interacted with the P protein\nstrongly between the fucose ring and the open cavity formed by\nthe \u00035 strand, which protruded from the \u0003-barrel, and nearby\nresidues, including Ser343, Thr344, Arg345, and Asp374 in one\nprotomer and Ser441, Gly442, and Tyr443 in the other. Resi-\ndues Thr344, Arg345, and Gly442 were located at the bottom\nof the cavity, while other residues surrounded them (Fig. 3).\nThe fact that both the A and B trisaccharides are located near\nthe P dimer interface indicates that dimerization is not only\nimportant structurally for the P domain but also essential for\nits receptor binding function.\nResidues Asp391 to Asn393 were missing in the native P\ndomain crystal structure but not in those of the complexes. The\nbinding of a trisaccharide introduced a water-bridged hydro-\ngen bond between Asp391 and saccharides; consequently, the\nmobility of the Asp391-Asn393 region was reduced, and the\nresidues became visible in the electron density map.

VIROL.\n\nin the absence of a ligand, the three residues amino-terminal to\nAsp374 (i.e., Thr371 to Asn373) and four residues (Ala294 to\nHis297) in a neighboring loop were missing. The binding of\nsaccharides also requires the remodeling of the Arg345 side\nchain, making it suitable for interaction with the \u0006-Fuc ring. 1n\nparticular, side chains of Gln336, Thr338, and Ser343 form\nfour hydrogen bonds with the guanidine group of Arg345 in the\ncomplex structure (Fig. 3E), while the Arg345 side chain pro-\ntrudes into the solvent and is highly mobile in the native struc-\nture. A higher level of \ufb02exibility around the binding site in the\nabsence of a ligand may be bene\ufb01cial to some extent for the\nreceptor binding by providing certain interface plasticity to\naccommodate different HBGAs (at a cost of entropy-related\nfree energy of binding).\nThe interface between the P protein and fucose is domi-\nnated by hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3D and Table 2), and as a result\nthe fucose ring is well de\ufb01ned in the electron density map. For\nexample, both the side chain carboxyl oxygen groups of Asp374\nform stable hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups of the fucose\nring: O\u000e1 to O3a (2.67 \u00c5) and O\u000e2 to O2a (2.55 \u00c5); Asp374,\nin turn, is supported by His347 through a side chain hydrogen\nbond (2.85 \u00c5) (Fig. 3E). The backbone O atom of Thr344 and\nthe N\u03b5 atom of the guanidine group of Arg345 also form strong\nhydrogen bonds with the fucose ring: O to O4a (2.62 \u00c5) and N\u03b5\nto O3a (2.82 \u00c5), respectively. 1n addition, there is a potential\n(3.35-\u00c5) hydrogen bond between the Oa atom on the fucose\nring and the backbone amide group of Gly442. The phenol\ngroup of the following Tyr443 exhibits a van der Waals inter-\naction with the methyl group at position 6 of the fucose ring.\nThe middle \u0003-Gal of the trisaccharide was clearly discerned\nin the electron density map. However, the shortest distance\nbetween the \u0003-Gal ring and the P dimer is 6.0 \u00c5, suggesting a\ncertain \ufb02exibility in the mode of binding between the \u0003-Gal\nring of the trisaccharide and the P dimer. 1n contrast, the\nterminal saccharide ring that differs between A (\u0006-GalNAc)\nand B (\u0006-Gal) trisaccharides exhibited weak electron density,\nperhaps due to a lack of constraints from the capsid protein. 1n addition to the observed ligand binding, we found another\nopen pocket nearby the \u0003-Gal ring. 1t is decorated by potential\nhydrogen-bonding donors and acceptors, including the back-\nbone O and side chain N\u03b52 atoms of Gln390, the backbone\namid group and side chain of Asp391, the backbone O atom of\nGly392, and the side chains of Asn393, His395, and Tyr443.\nThe hydroxyl group at position 1 of the \u0003-Gal ring, which\nwould connect to the rest of the ligand, pointed towards this\nopen pocket. We speculate that this pocket interacts with the\nsaccharide ring connecting to the hydroxyl group O1 of \u0003-Gal,\nand such an interaction might signi\ufb01cantly enhance the binding\naf\ufb01nity between the saccharide and the P protein.\nComparison with Norwalk virus. The superposition of the\ncrystal structures of the VA387 P domain and the Norwalk\nvirus capsid yields a root mean square deviation of 1.4 \u00c5 for\n245 residues from a total of 307 and 290 P domain residues for\nVA387 and Norwalk virus, respectively. The most signi\ufb01cant\nvariations in the backbones occur in the P2 subdomains, in-\ncluding the regions from His292 to 1le300, Thr337 to Thr344,\nand Thr368 to Leu375 of VA387 (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, a\nstructure-based amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. 4B)\nshows an overall identity of 37%, with 46% identity in the P1\nsubdomain but only 24% identity in the P2 subdomain between\nthe two viruses. 1n VA387, small insertions of residues Val290\nto Gly295, Thr337 to Glu340, and Thr369 to Asn373 compared\nto the Norwalk virus sequence appear to be responsible for the\ndifferent conformations in the above-mentioned regions. No-\ntably, all three insertions are located in the turns of three \u0003\nstrand pairs, \u00032-\u00033, \u00034-\u00035, and \u00036-\u00037, respectively, and at the\nsame end of the \u0003-barrel. They form a highly variable interface\nbetween the virus and the saccharide ligands. 1n addition, a\nthree-residue (Pro-Asn-Met) insertion between Try443 and\nAsn447 in VA387 makes the corresponding loop between \u00039\nFIG. 2.

Surprisingly, none of the VA387 residues interacting\nwith the ligand trisaccharides (Table 2) are conserved in Nor-\nwalk virus, suggesting that different receptor binding modes\nmay be used by the two viruses.\nDISCUSSION\nThe human histo-blood group antigens have been identi\ufb01ed\nas the norovirus receptors (5), and previous work on the struc-\nture of the Norwalk virus capsid has illustrated the domain\norganization of the VP1 protein (19). Nevertheless, conven-\ntional sequence-based homology modeling can provide only\nlimited information on the receptor binding patterns of noro-\nviruses because of the wide genetic diversity among norovirus\nsequences, which tend to undergo saturated substitution, in-\nsertions and deletions, and homologous recombination (21).\nTherefore, experimental, structural studies of receptor-virus\ncomplexes and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis are es-\nsential for our understanding of the speci\ufb01city and mechanism\nof the host-virus interaction. 1n the present work, we report the crystal structure of the\nVA387 P domain in complex with HBGA-related trisaccha-\nrides at 2.0-\u00c5 resolution, and a number of features of the P\nprotein that are associated with viral capsid assembly and re-\nceptor binding are described.

Numbers in parentheses are\nthe corresponding B factors (\u00c52). Residues marked with primes are from the\nsecond P dimer protomer. 1n addition, there is one hydrogen bond between the\ntrisaccharide and a nondimer neighboring P dimer molecule (Trp519 O6b-N\n\u00132.85 \u00c5\u0014). Solvent molecules (Sol) were numbered according to the Protein Data\nBank \ufb01le 2OBT.\n5954\nCAO ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nthe \u00061 helix surface as well as their neighboring residues and\nthe two dyad-symmetrical, close-contact regions between \u00035\nand \u00039 form a triangular interaction network. Based on statis-\ntics on protein crystal contacts (8), this dimer interface is likely\nalso to stabilize the homodimerization of the protein in solu-\ntion, con\ufb01rming the previous observations that norovirus P\nprotein spontaneously forms stable dimers when expressed in\nvitro (23, 26).\nTwo identical, independent receptor binding sites per P\ndimer are identi\ufb01ed at the outermost region of the P2 subdo-\nmain, each of which is contributed by both P protomers. The\ndistance between the centers of the two sites is 24 \u00c5. Among\nthe three sugars of the trisaccharides, \u0006-Fuc has the most\nextensive interaction with the P protein, consistent with the\nfact that this \u0006-Fuc is shared by all secretor antigens (A, B, and\nH) (25). This interaction belongs to a typical mode of \ufb02at\nbinding between saccharide and protein, as described previ-\nously (22), in which the saccharide ring lies \ufb02at on one side on\nthe protein surface while the other side of the ring faces the\nsolvent. Strikingly, we did not observe ligand binding in a\npreviously predicted pocket which is at the waist of the P dimer\nand fairly conserved among noroviruses (24). At this time, we\ncannot rule out the existence of other receptor binding sites in\nthe VA387 P dimer for the A and B or other saccharides. Such\nsites may have lower af\ufb01nity or may have been prohibited by\nthe crystal packing and were thus not observed in our complex\ncrystals. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that such an additional\nbinding site could have much higher af\ufb01nity than that observed\nin our complex crystal; otherwise, it might have prohibited\ncrystallization into our present crystal form.\nThe characteristic terminal groups for A (\u0006-GalNAc) and B\n(\u0006-Gal) trisaccharides (Fig. 2) contribute little to the binding\nwith the P dimer in their corresponding complex crystal struc-\ntures. This observation is consistent with results from a previ-\nous in vitro study, using saliva samples and synthetic oligosac-\ncharides, showing that A and B antigens have similar binding\naf\ufb01nities to the VA387 norovirus (23). 1n addition, we were\nunable to cocrystallize the P domain with H trisaccharide\n[\u0006-Fuc-(132)-\u0003-Gal-(134)-GlcNAc; Sigma] (data not shown). 1n contrast to A and B trisaccharides, the H trisaccharide\npossesses a GlcNAc ring at position 1 of \u0003-Gal but contains no\nsaccharide connected to position 3 of \u0003-Gal. Crystal-packing\nanalysis suggests that the GlcNAc unit should not prevent\ncocrystallization. Therefore, it appears that the absence of\n\u0006-GalNAc or \u0006-Gal in the H trisaccharide somehow reduces\nthe af\ufb01nity for the VA387 P domain, consistent with the in vitro\nbinding results obtained using saliva (23). The \ufb01ndings of pre-\nvious nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic studies\nsuggest that the conformation of the B trisaccharide is more\nrigid in general (17). 1nterestingly, in our case, the conforma-\ntions of both \u0006-Fuc and \u0003-Gal of the B trisaccharide were well\nde\ufb01ned in the electron density map and were very similar to\ntheir counterparts in the H trisaccharide in a previously de-\nscribed complex with N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase (14).\nBased the results of previous and present studies, the rec-\nognition of norovirus by HBGAs may occur at two levels. The\n\ufb01rst level is strain speci\ufb01c, in which a hydrogen-bonding net-\nwork is formed between saccharides and residues equivalent to\nThr344, Arg345, Asp374, and Gly442 of VA387. 1t has been\nshown previously that a Thr338-to-Ala mutation in VA387\nabolishes the binding with HBGAs of all A, B, and O types\n(24). Consistently, our complex structure illustrates that\nThr338 forms two hydrogen bonds with the guanidine group of\nFIG. 4. Comparison of the P domains of VA387 and Norwalk virus.

Vertical arrows denote putative trypsin cleavage sites based on results\nfrom mass spectrometry analyses.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nNOROVIRUS P DOMAIN AND TRISACCHARIDE COMPLEX STRUCTURE\n5955\n\nArg345 (Fig. 3E), essential for the latter to assume an active\nconformation for receptor binding.\nThe second level of recognition is nonspeci\ufb01c, which in-\nvolves mainly long-distance interaction necessary for initiating\nor stabilizing the interaction. 1n our cocrystallization protocol,\na molar excess of trisaccharide of more than 60-fold the\namount of protein was used in order to obtain high-quality\ncomplex crystals, indicating a low af\ufb01nity between the P protein\nand the trisaccharide. 1n contrast, the natural HBGAs have\nhigh af\ufb01nities for the viruses, indicating the existence of addi-\ntional interactions beyond those involving trisaccharide. As an\nalmost universal feature associated with viruses (28), both the\nnative HBGAs on the cell surface and the viral capsid are\nmultivalent, which may result in a super network at both levels\nof interactions and a high af\ufb01nity between the host cell and the\nvirus. 1n addition, parts of the glycan chains other than the\nterminal region of the HBGA may stabilize the overall inter-\naction through multiple contacts. 1t has been noted previously\nthat synthetic oligosaccharides conjugated to different back-\nbones (e.g., bovine serum albumin [23] and polyphenylacety-\nlene) reveal signi\ufb01cantly higher af\ufb01nities than free saccharides\n(M. Tan and X. Jiang, unpublished data), suggesting that the\nbackbones of HBGAs may similarly be involved in the second\nlevel of interaction. The biological signi\ufb01cance of the second-\nlevel interaction remains to be \ufb01rmly established.\nNorwalk virus and VA387 belong to different genogroups,\nand they are the only two noroviruses with their P domain\nthree-dimensional structures resolved. While they show overall\nstructural similarity, the compositions and structures of the\nreceptor binding interfaces of the two viruses are signi\ufb01cantly\ndifferent. For instance, a three-residue deletion between \u00039\nand \u000310 in the Norwalk virus results in the loss of one side wall\nof the VA387-like open pocket. This variation may shift the\nbinding site away from the dimer interface, although the\ndimerization may still support the receptor binding site. A\nshifted but similar distribution of polar residues and backbone\ngroups on the top surface of the Norwalk virus P dimer has\nbeen identi\ufb01ed as a potential \u0006-Fuc binding site. 1n addition,\nlike Arg345 in VA387, Norwalk virus Gln334 may form the\nbottom of the putative binding pocket and make crucial hy-\ndrogen bonds with the saccharide. 1n addition, VA207 shows the closest genetic relationship to\nVA387 in the P domain among strains that recognize non-\nsecretors as well as A, B, and O secretors. Primary sequence\nalignment shows that although the residue equivalent to\nVA387 Asp374 is missing in VA207, most other residues in-\nvolved in the hydrogen-bonding network with \u0006-Fuc are con-\nserved. The function of Asp374 may be performed by a neigh-\nboring asparagine residue in VA207. A mutagenesis analysis\nwould be necessary to verify the role of such VA207 residues in\nligand binding.\nFurthermore, the crystal structure of VA387 sheds light on\nthe structural bases of the receptor binding pro\ufb01les of other\nnoroviruses, such as Snow Mountain virus, norovirus strain\nMOH, and Hawaii virus (Fig. 5). These strains represent three\nreceptor binding patterns distinct from that of VA387 but\nshare the ability to bind to the B oligosaccharide chain and do\nnot bind to nonsecretors (Lea, an antigen without \u0006-Fuc linked\nto \u0003-Gal) (6). Their residues corresponding to Arg345 and\nAsp374 of VA387 are conserved and form direct hydrogen\nbonds with \u0006-Fuc. Moreover, the residues Gln336 and His347,\nwhich stabilize Arg345 and Asp374 in VA387, respectively, are\nalso conserved. All of these points suggest that the three strains\nhave receptor binding modes similar to that of VA387 at the\n\u0006-Fuc binding site.\nA full understanding of the antigen-virus recognition system\nwould provide a fundamental road map for the future devel-\nopment of novel pharmaceutical interventions to prevent and\ntreat norovirus-associated diseases. 1n particular, structural\nanalyses of P domain-trisaccharide complexes will be helpful in\nthe design of small-molecule reagents that exclusively interact\nwith norovirus. Furthermore, such studies would stimulate re-\nsearch on other HBGA-related pathogens.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Zhijie Liu, Neil Shaw, and Mark Bartlam for technical\ninstructions and helpful discussions.

Recent studies\non norovirus receptors show that different noroviruses recognize different human histo-blood group antigens\n(HBGAs), and eight receptor binding patterns of noroviruses have been identi\ufb01ed. The P domain of the\nnorovirus capsids is directly involved in this recognition. To determine the precise locations and receptor\nbinding modes of HBGA carbohydrates on the viral capsids, a recombinant P protein of a GII-4 strain\nnorovirus, VA387, was cocrystallized with synthetic type A or B trisaccharides. Based on complex crystal\nstructures observed at a 2.0-\u00c5 resolution, we demonstrated that the receptor binding site lies at the outermost\nend of the P domain and forms an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with the saccharide ligand. The A and\nB trisaccharides display similar binding modes, and the common fucose ring plays a key role in this interac-\ntion. The extensive interface between the two protomers in a P dimer also plays a crucial role in the formation\nof the receptor binding interface.\nNoroviruses, a group of small, round-structured, RNA vi-\nruses within the Caliciviridae family, are widespread human\npathogens causing epidemic acute gastroenteritis (7). Norovi-\nruses contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of\nabout 7.7 kb organized into three open reading frames (ORFs)\n(10). ORF1 encodes a polyprotein precursor of several non-\nstructural proteins. ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major capsid\nprotein (VP1) and a minor structural protein (VP2), respec-\ntively. Recombinant VP1 self-assembles into empty virus-like\nparticles similar to the native capsid in size and appearance (9).\nThe function of VP2 remains unknown, although data suggest\nthat it enhances the expression and stability of the viral capsids\n(1). Since noroviruses are nonenveloped, their spherical capsid\nsurfaces contributed by VP1 contain structural determinants\nfor host cell recognition.\nThe crystal structure of the prototype Norwalk virus capsid\nhas been determined based on the evaluation of recombinant\nvirus-like particles produced in baculovirus (19). The capsid\nexhibits icosahedral symmetry (T\u00023) and consists of 90 dimers\nor 180 monomers of the capsid protein (20). Each of the capsid\nmonomers has two principle domains, the amino-terminal shell\n(S) domain and the carboxyl-terminal protruding (P) domain,\nlinked by an approximately 10-residue hinge (19). The S do-\nmain possesses an eight-stranded antiparallel \u0003 sandwich\nstructure and constitutes the interior icosahedral shell, and the\nP domain forms an arch-shaped protrusion emanating from\nthe shell. The S domain is responsible for the intermolecular\ninteraction of the viral capsid and alone can form smooth\nicosahedral particles, whereas the P domain is involved mainly\nin dimeric interactions to stabilize the capsid (2). The P do-\nmain can be further divided into two subdomains, P1 and P2\n(19). P1 is more interior and exhibits a fairly conserved se-\nquence, while P2 is located at the outer surface and exhibits a\nhighly variable primary sequence, indicating that P2 is respon-\nsible for host interaction.\nNoroviruses have been found to recognize human histo-\nblood group antigens (HBGAs) as receptors, and eight distinct\nreceptor binding patterns of noroviruses have been described\npreviously (5, 25). Human HBGAs are complex glycans\npresent on the surfaces of red blood cells, on the epithelia of\nthe gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, or as free antigens in\nbiologic \ufb02uids such as saliva, milk, and intestinal contents (15).\nHuman HBGAs are highly polymorphic, and three major\nHBGA families, namely, the Lewis, secretor, and ABO fami-\nlies, are involved in norovirus recognition. Based on the host\ngenetics of the three families, the eight receptor binding pat-\nterns of noroviruses can be sorted into two groups: the A/B and\nthe Lewis (nonsecretor) binding groups (6). Direct evidence\nlinking HBGAs to norovirus infections and illness has been\nobtained in volunteer studies with Norwalk virus, but such\nevidence for representatives of other receptor binding patterns\nremains lacking.\nFunctional analyses of norovirus capsids have been carried\nout in an attempt to map the receptor binding site and to\n* Corresponding author.

Neverthe-\nless, the exact locations of receptor binding sites are still spec-\nulative, which has hindered our ability to combat this widely\nspreading virus.\nWith a view towards understanding the details of the inter-\nactions between the P domain and the receptor oligosaccha-\nride, we have determined the crystal structures of the VA387 P\ndomain in complexes with trisaccharides from A and B types of\nHBGAs. Based on the structures of the VA387 P domain-\ntrisaccharide complexes, models for the interaction between\nHBGAs and other noroviruses are also proposed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nProtein expression, puri\ufb01cation, and crystallization. The expression construct\nwas made by cloning the cDNA sequence encoding the P domain plus the hinge\nregion of the VA387 norovirus into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Bio-\nscience), as described previously (23). Comparing the sequence of our construct\nwith the originally submitted VP1 sequence of VA387 (GenBank accession\nnumber AAK84679) revealed a conservative, double point mutation, Thr355 to\nSer and Phe375 to Leu, presumably due to the high mutation rate of the\nnorovirus RNA genome, but the expressed protein showed no detectable differ-\nence from the wild-type one in receptor binding (23). The puri\ufb01cation procedure\nfor the P protein from Escherichia coli was described previously (23), and the\npuri\ufb01ed P protein (i.e., residues 214 to 539) was concentrated to 12 mg/ml and\nstored in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mM NaCl in 100-\u0004l\naliquots at \u000580\u00b0C. The recombinant protein was crystallized by the hanging-drop\nvapor diffusion method at 16\u00b0C; the P protein solution was mixed with an equal\nvolume (1.5 \u0004l) of the precipitant solution, which contained 8% (wt/vol) poly-\nethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and 200 mM magnesium acetate. The best-diffract-\ning, plate-shaped crystals grew to their maximum size of 0.1 by 0.3 by 0.6 mm in\nabout 30 days. To determine the probable degradation of the P protein during\ncrystallization, a native P domain crystal was washed quickly with water, dis-\nsolved in water, and analyzed by mass spectrometry (by using an AXIMA-CFR\nplus instrument; Shimadzu). Following the success of the crystallization of the P\ndomain alone, the protein was cocrystallized with the blood group A trisaccha-\nride {\u0006-L-Fuc-(132)-[\u0006-D-GalNAc-(133)]-D-Gal; Sigma } and the B trisaccha-\nride {\u0006-l-Fuc-(132)-[\u0006-D-Gal-(133)]-D-Gal; Sigma } under crystallization con-\nditions similar to those described above. Molar excesses of the trisaccharide\nbetween 0 and 80-fold the amount of the protein were tested, and an optimal\nmolar excess for obtaining complex crystals was found to be about 65-fold.\nData collection and processing. For each of the native VA387 P domain and\ncomplex crystals, X-ray diffraction data were collected from a \ufb02ash-cooled crystal\non a Mar345 image plate (Mar-Research) after soaking the crystal in a cryopro-\ntectant solution. The cryoprotectant solution free of trisaccharide contained 8%\n(wt/vol) PEG 3350, 200 mM magnesium acetate, 15% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 5%\n(vol/vol) PEG 400. The data were processed, scaled, and merged using the\nHKL2000 program package (18).\nStructure determination and re\ufb01nement. Phases of the P protein crystal struc-\nture were solved by the molecular replacement method by using a fragment\nstructure (residues Phe218 to Arg530) of a single protomer from the Norwalk\nvirus capsid (Protein Data Bank identi\ufb01cation, 1IHM) (19) as the search model\nand the program Phaser (16); the molecular replacement solution had a Z score\nof 10.40 and an log likelihood gain of 72.12 (16). Residues that differ between the\nNorwalk virus capsid and the VA387 P protein were then replaced according to\nthe VA387 amino acid sequence, and manual adjustments were carried out with\nthe program O (11) guided by the difference electron density maps expressed\nby the following equations: (2Fo \u0005 Fc) and (Fo \u0005 Fc), where Fo is the observed\nstructure factor and Fc is the calculated structure factor. Multiple cycles of\nrebuilding and re\ufb01nement with the programs CNS (3) and O were then carried\nout. At the \ufb01nal stages of re\ufb01nement, a composite omission map was calculated\nto eliminate model bias, and water molecules with good hydrogen-bonding po-\ntentials were located in peaks (\u00072.5\b) of the (Fo \u0005 Fc) map. The upper B factor\nlimit was set to 200 \u00c52 in the re\ufb01nement. Data-processing and structural re\ufb01ne-\nment statistics are summarized in Table 1. The re\ufb01ned structures were evaluated\nwith the program PROCHECK (13); in all three re\ufb01ned structures, a single\nresidue, Asn373, was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot\nin the A-type complex, which appeared to be the result of direct interaction with\na nearby A trisaccharide molecule. The structural analysis was performed mainly\nby using the program EdPDB (29). The radii of both the probe and the solvent\nmolecule were assigned as 1.4 \u00c5.\nProtein Data Bank accession codes. The coordinates and structure factors for\nthe P protein (2OBR), the complex with A trisaccharide (2OBS), and the com-\nplex with B trisaccharide (2OBT) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank,\nResearch Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New\nBrunswick, NJ.\nRESULTS\nStructural overview. The recombinant P protein (i.e., resi-\ndues 214 to 539) of VA387, a Lordsdale-like GII-4 strain of\nnorovirus, was expressed and puri\ufb01ed from E. coli and crystal-\nlized. The native crystal structure was determined at a 2.2-\u00c5\nresolution by using the molecular replacement method. It be-\nlongs to the C2221 space group, with 1 protein molecule per\nasymmetric unit and a Matthews coef\ufb01cient (VM) of 2.2 \u00c53/Da\n(\t44% solvent content). Mass spectrometry analysis of the\ncrystal sample indicated that the crystallized protein had a\nmolecular mass of 34.4 kDa, compared with the calculated\n35.9-kDa molecular mass of the recombinant protein. This\nobservation suggested that the protein sample had been slowly\ndigested proteolytically during the crystallization process,\nwhich might be bene\ufb01cial for obtaining the high-quality crystal.\nFurthermore, residues Ala294 to His297, Thr371 to Asn373,\nand Asp391 to Asn393 in three loop regions could not be\nlocated on the electron density map when the P protein was\ncrystallized alone, yet they became well de\ufb01ned when either A\nor B trisaccharide was added. In addition, there was no inter-\npretable electron density for residues 531 to 535, indicating a\n\ufb02exible C terminus. The \ufb01nal model of the re\ufb01ned P domain\nmonomer contained residues Thr224 to Gly530, with dimen-\nsions of 44 by 49 by 64 \u00c5.\nSimilar to the Norwalk viral capsid, the P2 subdomain (res-\nidues 275 to 417) of VA387 appears to be an insertion in the P1\nsubdomain (residues 222 to 274 and 418 to 539) between\nGly274 and Ala418 (Fig. 1A and B), which are 4.6 \u00c5 apart as\nmeasured between their C\u0006 atoms. The P1 subdomain has two\ntwisted \u0003-sheets sharing strands \u00031 and \u00038 (Fig. 1B). Both\n\u0003-sheets consist of purely antiparallel \u0003 strands. The smaller\n\u0003-sheet has a strand order of \u00031-\u00038-\u000310, in which the amino\nterminus of \u00031 and the carboxyl terminus of \u00038 participate.\nThe larger \u0003-sheet has a strand order of \u000314-\u00031-\u00038-\u000313-\u000312-\n\u000311-\u000315, in which the carboxyl terminus of \u00031 and the amino\nterminus of \u00038 participate. There is only one well-de\ufb01ned \u0006\nhelix (\u00061, residues 454 to 463) in the entire P domain which is\nin the P1 subdomain and is involved in P domain homodimer-\nization. The two \u0003-sheets and the \u00061 helix plus the amino-\nterminal region (i.e., residues 227 to 237) contribute to the\nhydrophobic core of P1. The P2 subdomain features a six-\nstranded, antiparallel \u0003-barrel of a Greek key topology with a\nstrand order of \u00032-\u00033-\u00036-\u00035-\u00034-\u00037 and a well-packed hydro-\nphobic core. The P1 and P2 subdomains are cushioned by a\nrandom coil-dominated region without a signi\ufb01cant secondary\nstructure (Fig. 1A, left).\nThere are 26 (8.2%) proline residues in each P monomer; 19\nof them are conserved between VA387 and Norwalk virus,\naccounting for 16.4% of all the residues conserved between\nthese strains. In comparison, the average frequency of proline\n5950\nCAO ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nresidues in proteins from different species usually ranges be-\ntween 2.1 and 6.5% (27). In addition, 36% of backbone car-\nbonyl oxygen atoms and 24% of backbone amide groups in the\n\ufb01nal model hydrogen bond with crystallographically localized\nwater molecules (i.e., operationally de\ufb01ned as those within 3.3\n\u00c5) to satisfy their hydrogen bond potential. The high proline\nfrequency in the P domain and the extensive interactions of\nthis domain with water molecules may partially contribute to\nits stability at the low secondary-structure content (3% \u0006 he-\nlices and 29% \u0003 strands).\nP domain dimer. The P domain of VA387 forms a ho-\nmodimer with dimensions of 57 by 63 by 69 \u00c5. It comprises two\nasymmetric units related by the crystallographic two-fold a\naxis. The P dimer interface is formed mainly between the two\n\u0003-barrels in the P2 subdomains (between strands \u00035 and \u00039)\nand between the two dyad-related regions surrounding the \u00061\nhelices in the P1 subdomains (Fig. 1A, right). The dimer in-\nterface contains a large buried surface area twisted by \t60\u00b0\nfrom the \u00061-\u00061 region to the \u00035-\u00039 contact regions, which\ngreatly stabilizes the dimer structure.\nThe total area of the solvent-accessible surface (SAS) buried\nfrom each protomer during dimerization is about 1,800 \u00c52.\nThe contribution of nonpolar carbon atoms (52%) to the\ndimerization almost equals that of the polar atoms (48%),\nsuggesting that both hydrophobic and polar interactions are\nimportant to the dimerization. Alternatively, there are a total\nof 57 residues from each protomer having SAS\u2019s buried upon\ndimerization; among them, 14 are charged residues (i.e., Arg,\nLys, His, Asp, and Glu), 20 are noncharged polar residues (i.e.,\nSer, Thr, Asn, Gln, and Tyr), and the remaining 23 are hydro-\nTABLE 1.

Moreover, a total of 72 water molecules (36\nindependent molecules corresponding to each protomer) were\nfound in the P dimer interface (i.e., less than 6 \u00c5 from both P\ndomain protomers and with more than 70% of the SAS buried\nby the P dimer). Cleary, water molecules play critical roles in\nstabilizing the P domain dimerization.\nAlong the dyad axis, we can divide the dimer interface into\nfour layers (Fig. 1C). The top layer has a hydrophobic center\nand two hydrogen bond-rich regions. The hydrophobic center\nis formed by side chains of Met333, Lys348, Thr384, and\nVal386, and each hydrogen bond-rich region is formed by four\nintermolecular hydrogen bonds between \ufb01ve residues: Thr344\nN-Gly442 O (2.86 \u00c5), Thr344 O\u000b-Ser441 N (2.90 \u00c5), Thr344\nO\u000b-Gly442 O (2.92 \u00c5), and Ala346 N-Cys440 O (3.17 \u00c5).\nAround Arg345, there is an open cavity accessible to the re-\nceptor ligands with a size of about 10 by 8 by 4 \u00c5 (see below).\nThe remaining three layers are a water tumel, a hydrophobic\nlayer (residues Pro243, Pro245, Ala280, and Val281), and a\nmixed hydrophilic center with two hydrophobic edges. Inside\nthe symmetrical water tumel in the dimer interface perpen-\ndicular to the dyad axis, with Glu274, Trp308, Thr337, and\nThr436 forming the entrance, about 20 transiently located wa-\nter molecules form a nearly continuous hydrogen-bonding net-\nwork with the surrounding amino acid residues. The hydro-\nphilic center of the fourth layer is formed by side chains of\nSer238, Ser279, Glu455, Gln458, His459, and Glu463 as well as\na number of buried water molecules, and each of the two\nhydrophobic edges is formed by Ile231, Leu232, and Leu278.\nP domain-trisaccharide complex.

All three saccharide rings in the trisaccharides\nwere modeled as chair conformations. Between the two trisac-\ncharides, the B trisaccharide was better de\ufb01ned in the electron\ndensity map (Fig. 2C), and the results presented below are\nbased mainly on data from the B-type complex. It is pertinent\nto note, however, that the overall ligand binding modes were\nalmost identical between the two complex crystals; there were\nno signi\ufb01cant features (at \f2.8\b levels) in an [FO(A complex) \u0005\nFO(B complex)] difference electron density map.\nBoth A and B trisaccharides interacted with the P protein\nstrongly between the fucose ring and the open cavity formed by\nthe \u00035 strand, which protruded from the \u0003-barrel, and nearby\nresidues, including Ser343, Thr344, Arg345, and Asp374 in one\nprotomer and Ser441, Gly442, and Tyr443 in the other. Resi-\ndues Thr344, Arg345, and Gly442 were located at the bottom\nof the cavity, while other residues surrounded them (Fig. 3).\nThe fact that both the A and B trisaccharides are located near\nthe P dimer interface indicates that dimerization is not only\nimportant structurally for the P domain but also essential for\nits receptor binding function.\nResidues Asp391 to Asn393 were missing in the native P\ndomain crystal structure but not in those of the complexes. The\nbinding of a trisaccharide introduced a water-bridged hydro-\ngen bond between Asp391 and saccharides; consequently, the\nmobility of the Asp391-Asn393 region was reduced, and the\nresidues became visible in the electron density map. Similarly,\nFIG. 1. Dimer of the VA387 P domain. (A) Ribbon representation of the P monomer and dimer.

VIROL.\n\nin the absence of a ligand, the three residues amino-terminal to\nAsp374 (i.e., Thr371 to Asn373) and four residues (Ala294 to\nHis297) in a neighboring loop were missing. The binding of\nsaccharides also requires the remodeling of the Arg345 side\nchain, making it suitable for interaction with the \u0006-Fuc ring. In\nparticular, side chains of Gln336, Thr338, and Ser343 form\nfour hydrogen bonds with the guanidine group of Arg345 in the\ncomplex structure (Fig. 3E), while the Arg345 side chain pro-\ntrudes into the solvent and is highly mobile in the native struc-\nture. A higher level of \ufb02exibility around the binding site in the\nabsence of a ligand may be bene\ufb01cial to some extent for the\nreceptor binding by providing certain interface plasticity to\naccommodate different HBGAs (at a cost of entropy-related\nfree energy of binding).\nThe interface between the P protein and fucose is domi-\nnated by hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3D and Table 2), and as a result\nthe fucose ring is well de\ufb01ned in the electron density map. For\nexample, both the side chain carboxyl oxygen groups of Asp374\nform stable hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups of the fucose\nring: O\u000e1 to O3a (2.67 \u00c5) and O\u000e2 to O2a (2.55 \u00c5); Asp374,\nin turn, is supported by His347 through a side chain hydrogen\nbond (2.85 \u00c5) (Fig. 3E). The backbone O atom of Thr344 and\nthe N\u03b5 atom of the guanidine group of Arg345 also form strong\nhydrogen bonds with the fucose ring: O to O4a (2.62 \u00c5) and N\u03b5\nto O3a (2.82 \u00c5), respectively. In addition, there is a potential\n(3.35-\u00c5) hydrogen bond between the Oa atom on the fucose\nring and the backbone amide group of Gly442. The phenol\ngroup of the following Tyr443 exhibits a van der Waals inter-\naction with the methyl group at position 6 of the fucose ring.\nThe middle \u0003-Gal of the trisaccharide was clearly discerned\nin the electron density map. However, the shortest distance\nbetween the \u0003-Gal ring and the P dimer is 6.0 \u00c5, suggesting a\ncertain \ufb02exibility in the mode of binding between the \u0003-Gal\nring of the trisaccharide and the P dimer. In contrast, the\nterminal saccharide ring that differs between A (\u0006-GalNAc)\nand B (\u0006-Gal) trisaccharides exhibited weak electron density,\nperhaps due to a lack of constraints from the capsid protein.\nIn addition to the observed ligand binding, we found another\nopen pocket nearby the \u0003-Gal ring. It is decorated by potential\nhydrogen-bonding donors and acceptors, including the back-\nbone O and side chain N\u03b52 atoms of Gln390, the backbone\namid group and side chain of Asp391, the backbone O atom of\nGly392, and the side chains of Asn393, His395, and Tyr443.\nThe hydroxyl group at position 1 of the \u0003-Gal ring, which\nwould comect to the rest of the ligand, pointed towards this\nopen pocket. We speculate that this pocket interacts with the\nsaccharide ring comecting to the hydroxyl group O1 of \u0003-Gal,\nand such an interaction might signi\ufb01cantly enhance the binding\naf\ufb01nity between the saccharide and the P protein.\nComparison with Norwalk virus. The superposition of the\ncrystal structures of the VA387 P domain and the Norwalk\nvirus capsid yields a root mean square deviation of 1.4 \u00c5 for\n245 residues from a total of 307 and 290 P domain residues for\nVA387 and Norwalk virus, respectively. The most signi\ufb01cant\nvariations in the backbones occur in the P2 subdomains, in-\ncluding the regions from His292 to Ile300, Thr337 to Thr344,\nand Thr368 to Leu375 of VA387 (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, a\nstructure-based amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. 4B)\nshows an overall identity of 37%, with 46% identity in the P1\nsubdomain but only 24% identity in the P2 subdomain between\nthe two viruses. In VA387, small insertions of residues Val290\nto Gly295, Thr337 to Glu340, and Thr369 to Asn373 compared\nto the Norwalk virus sequence appear to be responsible for the\ndifferent conformations in the above-mentioned regions. No-\ntably, all three insertions are located in the turns of three \u0003\nstrand pairs, \u00032-\u00033, \u00034-\u00035, and \u00036-\u00037, respectively, and at the\nsame end of the \u0003-barrel. They form a highly variable interface\nbetween the virus and the saccharide ligands. In addition, a\nthree-residue (Pro-Asn-Met) insertion between Try443 and\nAsn447 in VA387 makes the corresponding loop between \u00039\nFIG. 2.

Surprisingly, none of the VA387 residues interacting\nwith the ligand trisaccharides (Table 2) are conserved in Nor-\nwalk virus, suggesting that different receptor binding modes\nmay be used by the two viruses.\nDISCUSSION\nThe human histo-blood group antigens have been identi\ufb01ed\nas the norovirus receptors (5), and previous work on the struc-\nture of the Norwalk virus capsid has illustrated the domain\norganization of the VP1 protein (19). Nevertheless, conven-\ntional sequence-based homology modeling can provide only\nlimited information on the receptor binding patterns of noro-\nviruses because of the wide genetic diversity among norovirus\nsequences, which tend to undergo saturated substitution, in-\nsertions and deletions, and homologous recombination (21).\nTherefore, experimental, structural studies of receptor-virus\ncomplexes and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis are es-\nsential for our understanding of the speci\ufb01city and mechanism\nof the host-virus interaction.\nIn the present work, we report the crystal structure of the\nVA387 P domain in complex with HBGA-related trisaccha-\nrides at 2.0-\u00c5 resolution, and a number of features of the P\nprotein that are associated with viral capsid assembly and re-\nceptor binding are described.

Numbers in parentheses are\nthe corresponding B factors (\u00c52). Residues marked with primes are from the\nsecond P dimer protomer. In addition, there is one hydrogen bond between the\ntrisaccharide and a nondimer neighboring P dimer molecule (Trp519 O6b-N\n\u00132.85 \u00c5\u0014). Solvent molecules (Sol) were numbered according to the Protein Data\nBank \ufb01le 2OBT.\n5954\nCAO ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nthe \u00061 helix surface as well as their neighboring residues and\nthe two dyad-symmetrical, close-contact regions between \u00035\nand \u00039 form a triangular interaction network. Based on statis-\ntics on protein crystal contacts (8), this dimer interface is likely\nalso to stabilize the homodimerization of the protein in solu-\ntion, con\ufb01rming the previous observations that norovirus P\nprotein spontaneously forms stable dimers when expressed in\nvitro (23, 26).\nTwo identical, independent receptor binding sites per P\ndimer are identi\ufb01ed at the outermost region of the P2 subdo-\nmain, each of which is contributed by both P protomers. The\ndistance between the centers of the two sites is 24 \u00c5. Among\nthe three sugars of the trisaccharides, \u0006-Fuc has the most\nextensive interaction with the P protein, consistent with the\nfact that this \u0006-Fuc is shared by all secretor antigens (A, B, and\nH) (25). This interaction belongs to a typical mode of \ufb02at\nbinding between saccharide and protein, as described previ-\nously (22), in which the saccharide ring lies \ufb02at on one side on\nthe protein surface while the other side of the ring faces the\nsolvent. Strikingly, we did not observe ligand binding in a\npreviously predicted pocket which is at the waist of the P dimer\nand fairly conserved among noroviruses (24). At this time, we\ncamot rule out the existence of other receptor binding sites in\nthe VA387 P dimer for the A and B or other saccharides. Such\nsites may have lower af\ufb01nity or may have been prohibited by\nthe crystal packing and were thus not observed in our complex\ncrystals. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that such an additional\nbinding site could have much higher af\ufb01nity than that observed\nin our complex crystal; otherwise, it might have prohibited\ncrystallization into our present crystal form.\nThe characteristic terminal groups for A (\u0006-GalNAc) and B\n(\u0006-Gal) trisaccharides (Fig. 2) contribute little to the binding\nwith the P dimer in their corresponding complex crystal struc-\ntures. This observation is consistent with results from a previ-\nous in vitro study, using saliva samples and synthetic oligosac-\ncharides, showing that A and B antigens have similar binding\naf\ufb01nities to the VA387 norovirus (23). In addition, we were\nunable to cocrystallize the P domain with H trisaccharide\n[\u0006-Fuc-(132)-\u0003-Gal-(134)-GlcNAc; Sigma] (data not shown).\nIn contrast to A and B trisaccharides, the H trisaccharide\npossesses a GlcNAc ring at position 1 of \u0003-Gal but contains no\nsaccharide comected to position 3 of \u0003-Gal. Crystal-packing\nanalysis suggests that the GlcNAc unit should not prevent\ncocrystallization. Therefore, it appears that the absence of\n\u0006-GalNAc or \u0006-Gal in the H trisaccharide somehow reduces\nthe af\ufb01nity for the VA387 P domain, consistent with the in vitro\nbinding results obtained using saliva (23). The \ufb01ndings of pre-\nvious nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic studies\nsuggest that the conformation of the B trisaccharide is more\nrigid in general (17). Interestingly, in our case, the conforma-\ntions of both \u0006-Fuc and \u0003-Gal of the B trisaccharide were well\nde\ufb01ned in the electron density map and were very similar to\ntheir counterparts in the H trisaccharide in a previously de-\nscribed complex with N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase (14).\nBased the results of previous and present studies, the rec-\nognition of norovirus by HBGAs may occur at two levels. The\n\ufb01rst level is strain speci\ufb01c, in which a hydrogen-bonding net-\nwork is formed between saccharides and residues equivalent to\nThr344, Arg345, Asp374, and Gly442 of VA387. It has been\nshown previously that a Thr338-to-Ala mutation in VA387\nabolishes the binding with HBGAs of all A, B, and O types\n(24). Consistently, our complex structure illustrates that\nThr338 forms two hydrogen bonds with the guanidine group of\nFIG. 4. Comparison of the P domains of VA387 and Norwalk virus.

Vertical arrows denote putative trypsin cleavage sites based on results\nfrom mass spectrometry analyses.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nNOROVIRUS P DOMAIN AND TRISACCHARIDE COMPLEX STRUCTURE\n5955\n\nArg345 (Fig. 3E), essential for the latter to assume an active\nconformation for receptor binding.\nThe second level of recognition is nonspeci\ufb01c, which in-\nvolves mainly long-distance interaction necessary for initiating\nor stabilizing the interaction. In our cocrystallization protocol,\na molar excess of trisaccharide of more than 60-fold the\namount of protein was used in order to obtain high-quality\ncomplex crystals, indicating a low af\ufb01nity between the P protein\nand the trisaccharide. In contrast, the natural HBGAs have\nhigh af\ufb01nities for the viruses, indicating the existence of addi-\ntional interactions beyond those involving trisaccharide. As an\nalmost universal feature associated with viruses (28), both the\nnative HBGAs on the cell surface and the viral capsid are\nmultivalent, which may result in a super network at both levels\nof interactions and a high af\ufb01nity between the host cell and the\nvirus. In addition, parts of the glycan chains other than the\nterminal region of the HBGA may stabilize the overall inter-\naction through multiple contacts. It has been noted previously\nthat synthetic oligosaccharides conjugated to different back-\nbones (e.g., bovine serum albumin [23] and polyphenylacety-\nlene) reveal signi\ufb01cantly higher af\ufb01nities than free saccharides\n(M. Tan and X. Jiang, unpublished data), suggesting that the\nbackbones of HBGAs may similarly be involved in the second\nlevel of interaction. The biological signi\ufb01cance of the second-\nlevel interaction remains to be \ufb01rmly established.\nNorwalk virus and VA387 belong to different genogroups,\nand they are the only two noroviruses with their P domain\nthree-dimensional structures resolved. While they show overall\nstructural similarity, the compositions and structures of the\nreceptor binding interfaces of the two viruses are signi\ufb01cantly\ndifferent. For instance, a three-residue deletion between \u00039\nand \u000310 in the Norwalk virus results in the loss of one side wall\nof the VA387-like open pocket. This variation may shift the\nbinding site away from the dimer interface, although the\ndimerization may still support the receptor binding site. A\nshifted but similar distribution of polar residues and backbone\ngroups on the top surface of the Norwalk virus P dimer has\nbeen identi\ufb01ed as a potential \u0006-Fuc binding site. In addition,\nlike Arg345 in VA387, Norwalk virus Gln334 may form the\nbottom of the putative binding pocket and make crucial hy-\ndrogen bonds with the saccharide.\nIn addition, VA207 shows the closest genetic relationship to\nVA387 in the P domain among strains that recognize non-\nsecretors as well as A, B, and O secretors. Primary sequence\nalignment shows that although the residue equivalent to\nVA387 Asp374 is missing in VA207, most other residues in-\nvolved in the hydrogen-bonding network with \u0006-Fuc are con-\nserved. The function of Asp374 may be performed by a neigh-\nboring asparagine residue in VA207. A mutagenesis analysis\nwould be necessary to verify the role of such VA207 residues in\nligand binding.\nFurthermore, the crystal structure of VA387 sheds light on\nthe structural bases of the receptor binding pro\ufb01les of other\nnoroviruses, such as Snow Mountain virus, norovirus strain\nMOH, and Hawaii virus (Fig. 5). These strains represent three\nreceptor binding patterns distinct from that of VA387 but\nshare the ability to bind to the B oligosaccharide chain and do\nnot bind to nonsecretors (Lea, an antigen without \u0006-Fuc linked\nto \u0003-Gal) (6). Their residues corresponding to Arg345 and\nAsp374 of VA387 are conserved and form direct hydrogen\nbonds with \u0006-Fuc. Moreover, the residues Gln336 and His347,\nwhich stabilize Arg345 and Asp374 in VA387, respectively, are\nalso conserved. All of these points suggest that the three strains\nhave receptor binding modes similar to that of VA387 at the\n\u0006-Fuc binding site.\nA full understanding of the antigen-virus recognition system\nwould provide a fundamental road map for the future devel-\nopment of novel pharmaceutical interventions to prevent and\ntreat norovirus-associated diseases. In particular, structural\nanalyses of P domain-trisaccharide complexes will be helpful in\nthe design of small-molecule reagents that exclusively interact\nwith norovirus. Furthermore, such studies would stimulate re-\nsearch on other HBGA-related pathogens.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Zhijie Liu, Neil Shaw, and Mark Bartlam for technical\ninstructions and helpful discussions.

Recent studies\non norovirus receptors show that different noroviruses recognize different human histo-blood group antigens\n(HBGAs), and eight receptor binding patterns of noroviruses have been identi\ufb01ed. The P domain of the\nnorovirus capsids is directly involved in this recognition. To determine the precise locations and receptor\nbinding modes of HBGA carbohydrates on the viral capsids, a recombinant P protein of a GII-4 strain\nnorovirus, VA387, was cocrystallized with synthetic type A or B trisaccharides. Based on complex crystal\nstructures observed at a 2.0-\u00c5 resolution, we demonstrated that the receptor binding site lies at the outermost\nend of the P domain and forms an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with the saccharide ligand. The A and\nB trisaccharides display similar binding modes, and the common fucose ring plays a key role in this interac-\ntion. The extensive interface between the two protomers in a P dimer also plays a crucial role in the formation\nof the receptor binding interface.\nNoroviruses, a group of small, round-structured, RNA vi-\nruses within the Caliciviridae family, are widespread human\npathogens causing epidemic acute gastroenteritis (7). Norovi-\nruses contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of\nabout 7.7 kb organized into three open reading frames (ORFs)\n(10). ORF1 encodes a polyprotein precursor of several non-\nstructural proteins. ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major capsid\nprotein (VP1) and a minor structural protein (VP2), respec-\ntively. Recombinant VP1 self-assembles into empty virus-like\nparticles similar to the native capsid in size and appearance (9).\nThe function of VP2 remains unknown, although data suggest\nthat it enhances the expression and stability of the viral capsids\n(1). Since noroviruses are nonenveloped, their spherical capsid\nsurfaces contributed by VP1 contain structural determinants\nfor host cell recognition.\nThe crystal structure of the prototype Norwalk virus capsid\nhas been determined based on the evaluation of recombinant\nvirus-like particles produced in baculovirus (19). The capsid\nexhibits icosahedral symmetry (T\u00023) and consists of 90 dimers\nor 180 monomers of the capsid protein (20). Each of the capsid\nmonomers has two principle domains, the amino-terminal shell\n(S) domain and the carboxyl-terminal protruding (P) domain,\nlinked by an approximately 10-residue hinge (19). The S do-\nmain possesses an eight-stranded antiparallel \u0003 sandwich\nstructure and constitutes the interior icosahedral shell, and the\nP domain forms an arch-shaped protrusion emanating from\nthe shell. The S domain is responsible for the intermolecular\ninteraction of the viral capsid and alone can form smooth\nicosahedral particles, whereas the P domain is involved mainly\nin dimeric interactions to stabilize the capsid (2). The P do-\nmain can be further divided into two subdomains, P1 and P2\n(19). P1 is more interior and exhibits a fairly conserved se-\nquence, while P2 is located at the outer surface and exhibits a\nhighly variable primary sequence, indicating that P2 is respon-\nsible for host interaction.\nNoroviruses have been found to recognize human histo-\nblood group antigens (HBGAs) as receptors, and eight distinct\nreceptor binding patterns of noroviruses have been described\npreviously (5, 25). Human HBGAs are complex glycans\npresent on the surfaces of red blood cells, on the epithelia of\nthe gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, or as free antigens in\nbiologic \ufb02uids such as saliva, milk, and intestinal contents (15).\nHuman HBGAs are highly polymorphic, and three major\nHBGA families, namely, the Lewis, secretor, and ABO fami-\nlies, are involved in norovirus recognition. Based on the host\ngenetics of the three families, the eight receptor binding pat-\nterns of noroviruses can be sorted into two groups: the A/B and\nthe Lewis (nonsecretor) binding groups (6). Direct evidence\nlinking HBGAs to norovirus infections and illness has been\nobtained in volunteer studies with Norwalk virus, but such\nevidence for representatives of other receptor binding patterns\nremains lacking.\nFunctional analyses of norovirus capsids have been carried\nout in an attempt to map the receptor binding site and to\n* Corresponding author.

Neverthe-\nless, the exact locations of receptor binding sites are still spec-\nulative, which has hindered our ability to combat this widely\nspreading virus.\nWith a view towards understanding the details of the inter-\nactions between the P domain and the receptor oligosaccha-\nride, we have determined the crystal structures of the VA387 P\ndomain in complexes with trisaccharides from A and B types of\nHBGAs. Based on the structures of the VA387 P domain-\ntrisaccharide complexes, models for the interaction between\nHBGAs and other noroviruses are also proposed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nProtein expression, puri\ufb01cation, and crystallization. The expression construct\nwas made by cloning the cDNA sequence encoding the P domain plus the hinge\nregion of the VA387 norovirus into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Bio-\nscience), as described previously (23). Comparing the sequence of our construct\nwith the originally submitted VP1 sequence of VA387 (GenBank accession\nnumber AAK84679) revealed a conservative, double point mutation, Thr355 to\nSer and Phe375 to Leu, presumably due to the high mutation rate of the\nnorovirus RNA genome, but the expressed protein showed no detectable differ-\nence from the wild-type one in receptor binding (23). The puri\ufb01cation procedure\nfor the P protein from Escherichia coli was described previously (23), and the\npuri\ufb01ed P protein (i.e., residues 214 to 539) was concentrated to 12 mg/ml and\nstored in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mM NaCl in 100-\u0004l\naliquots at \u000580\u00b0C. The recombinant protein was crystallized by the hanging-drop\nvapor diffusion method at 16\u00b0C; the P protein solution was mixed with an equal\nvolume (1.5 \u0004l) of the precipitant solution, which contained 8% (wt/vol) poly-\nethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and 200 mM magnesium acetate. The best-diffract-\ning, plate-shaped crystals grew to their maximum size of 0.1 by 0.3 by 0.6 mm in\nabout 30 days. To determine the probable degradation of the P protein during\ncrystallization, a native P domain crystal was washed quickly with water, dis-\nsolved in water, and analyzed by mass spectrometry (by using an AXIMA-CFR\nplus instrument; Shimadzu). Following the success of the crystallization of the P\ndomain alone, the protein was cocrystallized with the blood group A trisaccha-\nride {\u0006-L-Fuc-(132)-[\u0006-D-GalNAc-(133)]-D-Gal; Sigma } and the B trisaccha-\nride {\u0006-l-Fuc-(132)-[\u0006-D-Gal-(133)]-D-Gal; Sigma } under crystallization con-\nditions similar to those described above. Molar excesses of the trisaccharide\nbetween 0 and 80-fold the amount of the protein were tested, and an optimal\nmolar excess for obtaining complex crystals was found to be about 65-fold.\nData collection and processing. For each of the native VA387 P domain and\ncomplex crystals, X-ray diffraction data were collected from a \ufb02ash-cooled crystal\non a Mar345 image plate (Mar-Research) after soaking the crystal in a cryopro-\ntectant solution. The cryoprotectant solution free of trisaccharide contained 8%\n(wt/vol) PEG 3350, 200 mM magnesium acetate, 15% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 5%\n(vol/vol) PEG 400. The data were processed, scaled, and merged using the\nHKL2000 program package (18).\nStructure determination and re\ufb01nement. Phases of the P protein crystal struc-\nture were solved by the molecular replacement method by using a fragment\nstructure (residues Phe218 to Arg530) of a single protomer from the Norwalk\nvirus capsid (Protein Data Bank identi\ufb01cation, 1IHM) (19) as the search model\nand the program Phaser (16); the molecular replacement solution had a Z score\nof 10.40 and an log likelihood gain of 72.12 (16). Residues that differ between the\nNorwalk virus capsid and the VA387 P protein were then replaced according to\nthe VA387 amino acid sequence, and manual adjustments were carried out with\nthe program O (11) guided by the difference electron density maps expressed\nby the following equations: (2Fo \u0005 Fc) and (Fo \u0005 Fc), where Fo is the observed\nstructure factor and Fc is the calculated structure factor. Multiple cycles of\nrebuilding and re\ufb01nement with the programs CNS (3) and O were then carried\nout. At the \ufb01nal stages of re\ufb01nement, a composite omission map was calculated\nto eliminate model bias, and water molecules with good hydrogen-bonding po-\ntentials were located in peaks (\u00072.5\b) of the (Fo \u0005 Fc) map. The upper B factor\nlimit was set to 200 \u00c52 in the re\ufb01nement. Data-processing and structural re\ufb01ne-\nment statistics are summarized in Table 1. The re\ufb01ned structures were evaluated\nwith the program PROCHECK (13); in all three re\ufb01ned structures, a single\nresidue, Asn373, was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot\nin the A-type complex, which appeared to be the result of direct interaction with\na nearby A trisaccharide molecule. The structural analysis was performed mainly\nby using the program EdPDB (29). The radii of both the probe and the solvent\nmolecule were assigned as 1.4 \u00c5.\nProtein Data Bank accession codes. The coordinates and structure factors for\nthe P protein (2OBR), the complex with A trisaccharide (2OBS), and the com-\nplex with B trisaccharide (2OBT) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank,\nResearch Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New\nBrunswick, NJ.\nRESULTS\nStructural overview. The recombinant P protein (i.e., resi-\ndues 214 to 539) of VA387, a Lordsdale-like GII-4 strain of\nnorovirus, was expressed and puri\ufb01ed from E. coli and crystal-\nlized. The native crystal structure was determined at a 2.2-\u00c5\nresolution by using the molecular replacement method. It be-\nlongs to the C2221 space group, with 1 protein molecule per\nasymmetric unit and a Matthews coef\ufb01cient (VM) of 2.2 \u00c53/Da\n(\t44% solvent content). Mass spectrometry analysis of the\ncrystal sample indicated that the crystallized protein had a\nmolecular mass of 34.4 kDa, compared with the calculated\n35.9-kDa molecular mass of the recombinant protein. This\nobservation suggested that the protein sample had been slowly\ndigested proteolytically during the crystallization process,\nwhich might be bene\ufb01cial for obtaining the high-quality crystal.\nFurthermore, residues Ala294 to His297, Thr371 to Asn373,\nand Asp391 to Asn393 in three loop regions could not be\nlocated on the electron density map when the P protein was\ncrystallized alone, yet they became well de\ufb01ned when either A\nor B trisaccharide was added. In addition, there was no inter-\npretable electron density for residues 531 to 535, indicating a\n\ufb02exible C terminus. The \ufb01nal model of the re\ufb01ned P domain\nmonomer contained residues Thr224 to Gly530, with dimen-\nsions of 44 by 49 by 64 \u00c5.\nSimilar to the Norwalk viral capsid, the P2 subdomain (res-\nidues 275 to 417) of VA387 appears to be an insertion in the P1\nsubdomain (residues 222 to 274 and 418 to 539) between\nGly274 and Ala418 (Fig. 1A and B), which are 4.6 \u00c5 apart as\nmeasured between their C\u0006 atoms. The P1 subdomain has two\ntwisted \u0003-sheets sharing strands \u00031 and \u00038 (Fig. 1B). Both\n\u0003-sheets consist of purely antiparallel \u0003 strands. The smaller\n\u0003-sheet has a strand order of \u00031-\u00038-\u000310, in which the amino\nterminus of \u00031 and the carboxyl terminus of \u00038 participate.\nThe larger \u0003-sheet has a strand order of \u000314-\u00031-\u00038-\u000313-\u000312-\n\u000311-\u000315, in which the carboxyl terminus of \u00031 and the amino\nterminus of \u00038 participate. There is only one well-de\ufb01ned \u0006\nhelix (\u00061, residues 454 to 463) in the entire P domain which is\nin the P1 subdomain and is involved in P domain homodimer-\nization. The two \u0003-sheets and the \u00061 helix plus the amino-\nterminal region (i.e., residues 227 to 237) contribute to the\nhydrophobic core of P1. The P2 subdomain features a six-\nstranded, antiparallel \u0003-barrel of a Greek key topology with a\nstrand order of \u00032-\u00033-\u00036-\u00035-\u00034-\u00037 and a well-packed hydro-\nphobic core. The P1 and P2 subdomains are cushioned by a\nrandom coil-dominated region without a signi\ufb01cant secondary\nstructure (Fig. 1A, left).\nThere are 26 (8.2%) proline residues in each P monomer; 19\nof them are conserved between VA387 and Norwalk virus,\naccounting for 16.4% of all the residues conserved between\nthese strains. In comparison, the average frequency of proline\n5950\nCAO ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nresidues in proteins from different species usually ranges be-\ntween 2.1 and 6.5% (27). In addition, 36% of backbone car-\nbonyl oxygen atoms and 24% of backbone amide groups in the\n\ufb01nal model hydrogen bond with crystallographically localized\nwater molecules (i.e., operationally de\ufb01ned as those within 3.3\n\u00c5) to satisfy their hydrogen bond potential. The high proline\nfrequency in the P domain and the extensive interactions of\nthis domain with water molecules may partially contribute to\nits stability at the low secondary-structure content (3% \u0006 he-\nlices and 29% \u0003 strands).\nP domain dimer. The P domain of VA387 forms a ho-\nmodimer with dimensions of 57 by 63 by 69 \u00c5. It comprises two\nasymmetric units related by the crystallographic two-fold a\naxis. The P dimer interface is formed mainly between the two\n\u0003-barrels in the P2 subdomains (between strands \u00035 and \u00039)\nand between the two dyad-related regions surrounding the \u00061\nhelices in the P1 subdomains (Fig. 1A, right). The dimer in-\nterface contains a large buried surface area twisted by \t60\u00b0\nfrom the \u00061-\u00061 region to the \u00035-\u00039 contact regions, which\ngreatly stabilizes the dimer structure.\nThe total area of the solvent-accessible surface (SAS) buried\nfrom each protomer during dimerization is about 1,800 \u00c52.\nThe contribution of nonpolar carbon atoms (52%) to the\ndimerization almost equals that of the polar atoms (48%),\nsuggesting that both hydrophobic and polar interactions are\nimportant to the dimerization. Alternatively, there are a total\nof 57 residues from each protomer having SAS\u2019s buried upon\ndimerization; among them, 14 are charged residues (i.e., Arg,\nLys, His, Asp, and Glu), 20 are noncharged polar residues (i.e.,\nSer, Thr, Asn, Gln, and Tyr), and the remaining 23 are hydro-\nTABLE 1.

Moreover, a total of 72 water molecules (36\nindependent molecules corresponding to each protomer) were\nfound in the P dimer interface (i.e., less than 6 \u00c5 from both P\ndomain protomers and with more than 70% of the SAS buried\nby the P dimer). Cleary, water molecules play critical roles in\nstabilizing the P domain dimerization.\nAlong the dyad axis, we can divide the dimer interface into\nfour layers (Fig. 1C). The top layer has a hydrophobic center\nand two hydrogen bond-rich regions. The hydrophobic center\nis formed by side chains of Met333, Lys348, Thr384, and\nVal386, and each hydrogen bond-rich region is formed by four\nintermolecular hydrogen bonds between \ufb01ve residues: Thr344\nN-Gly442 O (2.86 \u00c5), Thr344 O\u000b-Ser441 N (2.90 \u00c5), Thr344\nO\u000b-Gly442 O (2.92 \u00c5), and Ala346 N-Cys440 O (3.17 \u00c5).\nAround Arg345, there is an open cavity accessible to the re-\nceptor ligands with a size of about 10 by 8 by 4 \u00c5 (see below).\nThe remaining three layers are a water tunnel, a hydrophobic\nlayer (residues Pro243, Pro245, Ala280, and Val281), and a\nmixed hydrophilic center with two hydrophobic edges. Inside\nthe symmetrical water tunnel in the dimer interface perpen-\ndicular to the dyad axis, with Glu274, Trp308, Thr337, and\nThr436 forming the entrance, about 20 transiently located wa-\nter molecules form a nearly continuous hydrogen-bonding net-\nwork with the surrounding amino acid residues. The hydro-\nphilic center of the fourth layer is formed by side chains of\nSer238, Ser279, Glu455, Gln458, His459, and Glu463 as well as\na number of buried water molecules, and each of the two\nhydrophobic edges is formed by Ile231, Leu232, and Leu278.\nP domain-trisaccharide complex. The crystal forms of the P\nprotein in complex with either the A or B trisaccharide\n(Fig. 2A and B) had an improved resolution (2.0 \u00c5) and were\notherwise isomorphous to that of the P domain in the absence\nof an oligosaccharide. The fucose (\u0006-Fuc) and galactose (\u0003-\nGal) rings shared by the A and B trisaccharides were clearly\nvisible at the \u00012.8\b contour level in [FO(complex) \u0005 FO(native)]\ndifference electron density maps phased with the protein\nmodel alone. All three saccharide rings in the trisaccharides\nwere modeled as chair conformations. Between the two trisac-\ncharides, the B trisaccharide was better de\ufb01ned in the electron\ndensity map (Fig. 2C), and the results presented below are\nbased mainly on data from the B-type complex. It is pertinent\nto note, however, that the overall ligand binding modes were\nalmost identical between the two complex crystals; there were\nno signi\ufb01cant features (at \f2.8\b levels) in an [FO(A complex) \u0005\nFO(B complex)] difference electron density map.\nBoth A and B trisaccharides interacted with the P protein\nstrongly between the fucose ring and the open cavity formed by\nthe \u00035 strand, which protruded from the \u0003-barrel, and nearby\nresidues, including Ser343, Thr344, Arg345, and Asp374 in one\nprotomer and Ser441, Gly442, and Tyr443 in the other. Resi-\ndues Thr344, Arg345, and Gly442 were located at the bottom\nof the cavity, while other residues surrounded them (Fig. 3).\nThe fact that both the A and B trisaccharides are located near\nthe P dimer interface indicates that dimerization is not only\nimportant structurally for the P domain but also essential for\nits receptor binding function.\nResidues Asp391 to Asn393 were missing in the native P\ndomain crystal structure but not in those of the complexes. The\nbinding of a trisaccharide introduced a water-bridged hydro-\ngen bond between Asp391 and saccharides; consequently, the\nmobility of the Asp391-Asn393 region was reduced, and the\nresidues became visible in the electron density map.

VIROL.\n\nin the absence of a ligand, the three residues amino-terminal to\nAsp374 (i.e., Thr371 to Asn373) and four residues (Ala294 to\nHis297) in a neighboring loop were missing. The binding of\nsaccharides also requires the remodeling of the Arg345 side\nchain, making it suitable for interaction with the \u0006-Fuc ring. In\nparticular, side chains of Gln336, Thr338, and Ser343 form\nfour hydrogen bonds with the guanidine group of Arg345 in the\ncomplex structure (Fig. 3E), while the Arg345 side chain pro-\ntrudes into the solvent and is highly mobile in the native struc-\nture. A higher level of \ufb02exibility around the binding site in the\nabsence of a ligand may be bene\ufb01cial to some extent for the\nreceptor binding by providing certain interface plasticity to\naccommodate different HBGAs (at a cost of entropy-related\nfree energy of binding).\nThe interface between the P protein and fucose is domi-\nnated by hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3D and Table 2), and as a result\nthe fucose ring is well de\ufb01ned in the electron density map. For\nexample, both the side chain carboxyl oxygen groups of Asp374\nform stable hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups of the fucose\nring: O\u000e1 to O3a (2.67 \u00c5) and O\u000e2 to O2a (2.55 \u00c5); Asp374,\nin turn, is supported by His347 through a side chain hydrogen\nbond (2.85 \u00c5) (Fig. 3E). The backbone O atom of Thr344 and\nthe N\u03b5 atom of the guanidine group of Arg345 also form strong\nhydrogen bonds with the fucose ring: O to O4a (2.62 \u00c5) and N\u03b5\nto O3a (2.82 \u00c5), respectively. In addition, there is a potential\n(3.35-\u00c5) hydrogen bond between the Oa atom on the fucose\nring and the backbone amide group of Gly442. The phenol\ngroup of the following Tyr443 exhibits a van der Waals inter-\naction with the methyl group at position 6 of the fucose ring.\nThe middle \u0003-Gal of the trisaccharide was clearly discerned\nin the electron density map. However, the shortest distance\nbetween the \u0003-Gal ring and the P dimer is 6.0 \u00c5, suggesting a\ncertain \ufb02exibility in the mode of binding between the \u0003-Gal\nring of the trisaccharide and the P dimer. In contrast, the\nterminal saccharide ring that differs between A (\u0006-GalNAc)\nand B (\u0006-Gal) trisaccharides exhibited weak electron density,\nperhaps due to a lack of constraints from the capsid protein.\nIn addition to the observed ligand binding, we found another\nopen pocket nearby the \u0003-Gal ring. It is decorated by potential\nhydrogen-bonding donors and acceptors, including the back-\nbone O and side chain N\u03b52 atoms of Gln390, the backbone\namid group and side chain of Asp391, the backbone O atom of\nGly392, and the side chains of Asn393, His395, and Tyr443.\nThe hydroxyl group at position 1 of the \u0003-Gal ring, which\nwould connect to the rest of the ligand, pointed towards this\nopen pocket. We speculate that this pocket interacts with the\nsaccharide ring connecting to the hydroxyl group O1 of \u0003-Gal,\nand such an interaction might signi\ufb01cantly enhance the binding\naf\ufb01nity between the saccharide and the P protein.\nComparison with Norwalk virus. The superposition of the\ncrystal structures of the VA387 P domain and the Norwalk\nvirus capsid yields a root mean square deviation of 1.4 \u00c5 for\n245 residues from a total of 307 and 290 P domain residues for\nVA387 and Norwalk virus, respectively. The most signi\ufb01cant\nvariations in the backbones occur in the P2 subdomains, in-\ncluding the regions from His292 to Ile300, Thr337 to Thr344,\nand Thr368 to Leu375 of VA387 (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, a\nstructure-based amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. 4B)\nshows an overall identity of 37%, with 46% identity in the P1\nsubdomain but only 24% identity in the P2 subdomain between\nthe two viruses. In VA387, small insertions of residues Val290\nto Gly295, Thr337 to Glu340, and Thr369 to Asn373 compared\nto the Norwalk virus sequence appear to be responsible for the\ndifferent conformations in the above-mentioned regions. No-\ntably, all three insertions are located in the turns of three \u0003\nstrand pairs, \u00032-\u00033, \u00034-\u00035, and \u00036-\u00037, respectively, and at the\nsame end of the \u0003-barrel. They form a highly variable interface\nbetween the virus and the saccharide ligands. In addition, a\nthree-residue (Pro-Asn-Met) insertion between Try443 and\nAsn447 in VA387 makes the corresponding loop between \u00039\nFIG. 2.

Surprisingly, none of the VA387 residues interacting\nwith the ligand trisaccharides (Table 2) are conserved in Nor-\nwalk virus, suggesting that different receptor binding modes\nmay be used by the two viruses.\nDISCUSSION\nThe human histo-blood group antigens have been identi\ufb01ed\nas the norovirus receptors (5), and previous work on the struc-\nture of the Norwalk virus capsid has illustrated the domain\norganization of the VP1 protein (19). Nevertheless, conven-\ntional sequence-based homology modeling can provide only\nlimited information on the receptor binding patterns of noro-\nviruses because of the wide genetic diversity among norovirus\nsequences, which tend to undergo saturated substitution, in-\nsertions and deletions, and homologous recombination (21).\nTherefore, experimental, structural studies of receptor-virus\ncomplexes and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis are es-\nsential for our understanding of the speci\ufb01city and mechanism\nof the host-virus interaction.\nIn the present work, we report the crystal structure of the\nVA387 P domain in complex with HBGA-related trisaccha-\nrides at 2.0-\u00c5 resolution, and a number of features of the P\nprotein that are associated with viral capsid assembly and re-\nceptor binding are described.

Numbers in parentheses are\nthe corresponding B factors (\u00c52). Residues marked with primes are from the\nsecond P dimer protomer. In addition, there is one hydrogen bond between the\ntrisaccharide and a nondimer neighboring P dimer molecule (Trp519 O6b-N\n\u00132.85 \u00c5\u0014). Solvent molecules (Sol) were numbered according to the Protein Data\nBank \ufb01le 2OBT.\n5954\nCAO ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nthe \u00061 helix surface as well as their neighboring residues and\nthe two dyad-symmetrical, close-contact regions between \u00035\nand \u00039 form a triangular interaction network. Based on statis-\ntics on protein crystal contacts (8), this dimer interface is likely\nalso to stabilize the homodimerization of the protein in solu-\ntion, con\ufb01rming the previous observations that norovirus P\nprotein spontaneously forms stable dimers when expressed in\nvitro (23, 26).\nTwo identical, independent receptor binding sites per P\ndimer are identi\ufb01ed at the outermost region of the P2 subdo-\nmain, each of which is contributed by both P protomers. The\ndistance between the centers of the two sites is 24 \u00c5. Among\nthe three sugars of the trisaccharides, \u0006-Fuc has the most\nextensive interaction with the P protein, consistent with the\nfact that this \u0006-Fuc is shared by all secretor antigens (A, B, and\nH) (25). This interaction belongs to a typical mode of \ufb02at\nbinding between saccharide and protein, as described previ-\nously (22), in which the saccharide ring lies \ufb02at on one side on\nthe protein surface while the other side of the ring faces the\nsolvent. Strikingly, we did not observe ligand binding in a\npreviously predicted pocket which is at the waist of the P dimer\nand fairly conserved among noroviruses (24). At this time, we\ncannot rule out the existence of other receptor binding sites in\nthe VA387 P dimer for the A and B or other saccharides. Such\nsites may have lower af\ufb01nity or may have been prohibited by\nthe crystal packing and were thus not observed in our complex\ncrystals. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that such an additional\nbinding site could have much higher af\ufb01nity than that observed\nin our complex crystal; otherwise, it might have prohibited\ncrystallization into our present crystal form.\nThe characteristic terminal groups for A (\u0006-GalNAc) and B\n(\u0006-Gal) trisaccharides (Fig. 2) contribute little to the binding\nwith the P dimer in their corresponding complex crystal struc-\ntures. This observation is consistent with results from a previ-\nous in vitro study, using saliva samples and synthetic oligosac-\ncharides, showing that A and B antigens have similar binding\naf\ufb01nities to the VA387 norovirus (23). In addition, we were\nunable to cocrystallize the P domain with H trisaccharide\n[\u0006-Fuc-(132)-\u0003-Gal-(134)-GlcNAc; Sigma] (data not shown).\nIn contrast to A and B trisaccharides, the H trisaccharide\npossesses a GlcNAc ring at position 1 of \u0003-Gal but contains no\nsaccharide connected to position 3 of \u0003-Gal. Crystal-packing\nanalysis suggests that the GlcNAc unit should not prevent\ncocrystallization. Therefore, it appears that the absence of\n\u0006-GalNAc or \u0006-Gal in the H trisaccharide somehow reduces\nthe af\ufb01nity for the VA387 P domain, consistent with the in vitro\nbinding results obtained using saliva (23). The \ufb01ndings of pre-\nvious nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic studies\nsuggest that the conformation of the B trisaccharide is more\nrigid in general (17). Interestingly, in our case, the conforma-\ntions of both \u0006-Fuc and \u0003-Gal of the B trisaccharide were well\nde\ufb01ned in the electron density map and were very similar to\ntheir counterparts in the H trisaccharide in a previously de-\nscribed complex with N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase (14).\nBased the results of previous and present studies, the rec-\nognition of norovirus by HBGAs may occur at two levels. The\n\ufb01rst level is strain speci\ufb01c, in which a hydrogen-bonding net-\nwork is formed between saccharides and residues equivalent to\nThr344, Arg345, Asp374, and Gly442 of VA387. It has been\nshown previously that a Thr338-to-Ala mutation in VA387\nabolishes the binding with HBGAs of all A, B, and O types\n(24). Consistently, our complex structure illustrates that\nThr338 forms two hydrogen bonds with the guanidine group of\nFIG. 4. Comparison of the P domains of VA387 and Norwalk virus.

Vertical arrows denote putative trypsin cleavage sites based on results\nfrom mass spectrometry analyses.\nVOL. 81, 2007\nNOROVIRUS P DOMAIN AND TRISACCHARIDE COMPLEX STRUCTURE\n5955\n\nArg345 (Fig. 3E), essential for the latter to assume an active\nconformation for receptor binding.\nThe second level of recognition is nonspeci\ufb01c, which in-\nvolves mainly long-distance interaction necessary for initiating\nor stabilizing the interaction. In our cocrystallization protocol,\na molar excess of trisaccharide of more than 60-fold the\namount of protein was used in order to obtain high-quality\ncomplex crystals, indicating a low af\ufb01nity between the P protein\nand the trisaccharide. In contrast, the natural HBGAs have\nhigh af\ufb01nities for the viruses, indicating the existence of addi-\ntional interactions beyond those involving trisaccharide. As an\nalmost universal feature associated with viruses (28), both the\nnative HBGAs on the cell surface and the viral capsid are\nmultivalent, which may result in a super network at both levels\nof interactions and a high af\ufb01nity between the host cell and the\nvirus. In addition, parts of the glycan chains other than the\nterminal region of the HBGA may stabilize the overall inter-\naction through multiple contacts. It has been noted previously\nthat synthetic oligosaccharides conjugated to different back-\nbones (e.g., bovine serum albumin [23] and polyphenylacety-\nlene) reveal signi\ufb01cantly higher af\ufb01nities than free saccharides\n(M. Tan and X. Jiang, unpublished data), suggesting that the\nbackbones of HBGAs may similarly be involved in the second\nlevel of interaction. The biological signi\ufb01cance of the second-\nlevel interaction remains to be \ufb01rmly established.\nNorwalk virus and VA387 belong to different genogroups,\nand they are the only two noroviruses with their P domain\nthree-dimensional structures resolved. While they show overall\nstructural similarity, the compositions and structures of the\nreceptor binding interfaces of the two viruses are signi\ufb01cantly\ndifferent. For instance, a three-residue deletion between \u00039\nand \u000310 in the Norwalk virus results in the loss of one side wall\nof the VA387-like open pocket. This variation may shift the\nbinding site away from the dimer interface, although the\ndimerization may still support the receptor binding site. A\nshifted but similar distribution of polar residues and backbone\ngroups on the top surface of the Norwalk virus P dimer has\nbeen identi\ufb01ed as a potential \u0006-Fuc binding site. In addition,\nlike Arg345 in VA387, Norwalk virus Gln334 may form the\nbottom of the putative binding pocket and make crucial hy-\ndrogen bonds with the saccharide.\nIn addition, VA207 shows the closest genetic relationship to\nVA387 in the P domain among strains that recognize non-\nsecretors as well as A, B, and O secretors. Primary sequence\nalignment shows that although the residue equivalent to\nVA387 Asp374 is missing in VA207, most other residues in-\nvolved in the hydrogen-bonding network with \u0006-Fuc are con-\nserved. The function of Asp374 may be performed by a neigh-\nboring asparagine residue in VA207. A mutagenesis analysis\nwould be necessary to verify the role of such VA207 residues in\nligand binding.\nFurthermore, the crystal structure of VA387 sheds light on\nthe structural bases of the receptor binding pro\ufb01les of other\nnoroviruses, such as Snow Mountain virus, norovirus strain\nMOH, and Hawaii virus (Fig. 5). These strains represent three\nreceptor binding patterns distinct from that of VA387 but\nshare the ability to bind to the B oligosaccharide chain and do\nnot bind to nonsecretors (Lea, an antigen without \u0006-Fuc linked\nto \u0003-Gal) (6). Their residues corresponding to Arg345 and\nAsp374 of VA387 are conserved and form direct hydrogen\nbonds with \u0006-Fuc. Moreover, the residues Gln336 and His347,\nwhich stabilize Arg345 and Asp374 in VA387, respectively, are\nalso conserved. All of these points suggest that the three strains\nhave receptor binding modes similar to that of VA387 at the\n\u0006-Fuc binding site.\nA full understanding of the antigen-virus recognition system\nwould provide a fundamental road map for the future devel-\nopment of novel pharmaceutical interventions to prevent and\ntreat norovirus-associated diseases. In particular, structural\nanalyses of P domain-trisaccharide complexes will be helpful in\nthe design of small-molecule reagents that exclusively interact\nwith norovirus. Furthermore, such studies would stimulate re-\nsearch on other HBGA-related pathogens.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Zhijie Liu, Neil Shaw, and Mark Bartlam for technical\ninstructions and helpful discussions.

Recent studies\non norovirus receptors show that different noroviruses recognize different human histo-blood group antigens\n(HBGAs), and eight receptor binding patterns of noroviruses have been identi\ufb01ed. The P domain of the\nnorovirus capsids is directly involved in this recognition. To determine the precise locations and receptor\nbinding modes of HBGA carbohydrates on the viral capsids, a recombinant P protein of a GII-4 strain\nnorovirus, VA387, was cocrystallized with synthetic type A or B trisaccharides. Based on complex crystal\nstructures observed at a 2.0-\u00c5 resolution, we demonstrated that the receptor binding site lies at the outermost\nend of the P domain and forms an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with the saccharide ligand. The A and\nB trisaccharides display similar binding modes, and the common fucose ring plays a key role in this interac-\ntion. The extensive interface between the two protomers in a P dimer also plays a crucial role in the formation\nof the receptor binding interface.\nNoroviruses, a group of small, round-structured, RNA vi-\nruses within the Caliciviridae family, are widespread human\npathogens causing epidemic acute gastroenteritis (7). Norovi-\nruses contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of\nabout 7.7 kb organized into three open reading frames (ORFs)\n(10). ORF1 encodes a polyprotein precursor of several non-\nstructural proteins. ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major capsid\nprotein (VP1) and a minor structural protein (VP2), respec-\ntively. Recombinant VP1 self-assembles into empty virus-like\nparticles similar to the native capsid in size and appearance (9).\nThe function of VP2 remains unknown, although data suggest\nthat it enhances the expression and stability of the viral capsids\n(1). Since noroviruses are nonenveloped, their spherical capsid\nsurfaces contributed by VP1 contain structural determinants\nfor host cell recognition.\nThe crystal structure of the prototype Norwalk virus capsid\nhas been determined based on the evaluation of recombinant\nvirus-like particles produced in baculovirus (19). The capsid\nexhibits icosahedral symmetry (T\u00023) and consists of 90 dimers\nor 180 monomers of the capsid protein (20). Each of the capsid\nmonomers has two principle domains, the amino-terminal shell\n(S) domain and the carboxyl-terminal protruding (P) domain,\nlinked by an approximately 10-residue hinge (19). The S do-\nmain possesses an eight-stranded antiparallel \u0003 sandwich\nstructure and constitutes the interior icosahedral shell, and the\nP domain forms an arch-shaped protrusion emanating from\nthe shell. The S domain is responsible for the intermolecular\ninteraction of the viral capsid and alone can form smooth\nicosahedral particles, whereas the P domain is involved mainly\nin dimeric interactions to stabilize the capsid (2). The P do-\nmain can be further divided into two subdomains, P1 and P2\n(19). P1 is more interior and exhibits a fairly conserved se-\nquence, while P2 is located at the outer surface and exhibits a\nhighly variable primary sequence, indicating that P2 is respon-\nsible for host interaction.\nNoroviruses have been found to recognize human histo-\nblood group antigens (HBGAs) as receptors, and eight distinct\nreceptor binding patterns of noroviruses have been described\npreviously (5, 25). Human HBGAs are complex glycans\npresent on the surfaces of red blood cells, on the epithelia of\nthe gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, or as free antigens in\nbiologic \ufb02uids such as saliva, milk, and intestinal contents (15).\nHuman HBGAs are highly polymorphic, and three major\nHBGA families, namely, the Lewis, secretor, and ABO fami-\nlies, are involved in norovirus recognition. Based on the host\ngenetics of the three families, the eight receptor binding pat-\nterns of noroviruses can be sorted into two groups: the A/B and\nthe Lewis (nonsecretor) binding groups (6). Direct evidence\nlinking HBGAs to norovirus infections and illness has been\nobtained in volunteer studies with Norwalk virus, but such\nevidence for representatives of other receptor binding patterns\nremains lacking.\nFunctional analyses of norovirus capsids have been carried\nout in an attempt to map the receptor binding site and to\n* Corresponding author.

Neverthe-\nless, the exact locations of receptor binding sites are still spec-\nulative, which has hindered our ability to combat this widely\nspreading virus.\nWith a view towards understanding the details of the inter-\nactions between the P domain and the receptor oligosaccha-\nride, we have determined the crystal structures of the VA387 P\ndomain in complexes with trisaccharides from A and B types of\nHBGAs. Based on the structures of the VA387 P domain-\ntrisaccharide complexes, models for the interaction between\nHBGAs and other noroviruses are also proposed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nProtein expression, puri\ufb01cation, and crystallization. The expression construct\nwas made by cloning the cDNA sequence encoding the P domain plus the hinge\nregion of the VA387 norovirus into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Bio-\nscience), as described previously (23). Comparing the sequence of our construct\nwith the originally submitted VP1 sequence of VA387 (GenBank accession\nnumber AAK84679) revealed a conservative, double point mutation, Thr355 to\nSer and Phe375 to Leu, presumably due to the high mutation rate of the\nnorovirus RNA genome, but the expressed protein showed no detectable differ-\nence from the wild-type one in receptor binding (23). The puri\ufb01cation procedure\nfor the P protein from Escherichia coli was described previously (23), and the\npuri\ufb01ed P protein (i.e., residues 214 to 539) was concentrated to 12 mg/ml and\nstored in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mM NaCl in 100-\u0004l\naliquots at \u000580\u00b0C. The recombinant protein was crystallized by the hanging-drop\nvapor diffusion method at 16\u00b0C; the P protein solution was mixed with an equal\nvolume (1.5 \u0004l) of the precipitant solution, which contained 8% (wt/vol) poly-\nethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and 200 mM magnesium acetate. The best-diffract-\ning, plate-shaped crystals grew to their maximum size of 0.1 by 0.3 by 0.6 mm in\nabout 30 days. To determine the probable degradation of the P protein during\ncrystallization, a native P domain crystal was washed quickly with water, dis-\nsolved in water, and analyzed by mass spectrometry (by using an AXIMA-CFR\nplus instrument; Shimadzu). Following the success of the crystallization of the P\ndomain alone, the protein was cocrystallized with the blood group A trisaccha-\nride {\u0006-L-Fuc-(132)-[\u0006-D-GalNAc-(133)]-D-Gal; Sigma } and the B trisaccha-\nride {\u0006-l-Fuc-(132)-[\u0006-D-Gal-(133)]-D-Gal; Sigma } under crystallization con-\nditions similar to those described above. Molar excesses of the trisaccharide\nbetween 0 and 80-fold the amount of the protein were tested, and an optimal\nmolar excess for obtaining complex crystals was found to be about 65-fold.\nData collection and processing. For each of the native VA387 P domain and\ncomplex crystals, X-ray diffraction data were collected from a \ufb02ash-cooled crystal\non a Mar345 image plate (Mar-Research) after soaking the crystal in a cryopro-\ntectant solution. The cryoprotectant solution free of trisaccharide contained 8%\n(wt/vol) PEG 3350, 200 mM magnesium acetate, 15% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 5%\n(vol/vol) PEG 400. The data were processed, scaled, and merged using the\nHKL2000 program package (18).\nStructure determination and re\ufb01nement. Phases of the P protein crystal struc-\nture were solved by the molecular replacement method by using a fragment\nstructure (residues Phe218 to Arg530) of a single protomer from the Norwalk\nvirus capsid (Protein Data Bank identi\ufb01cation, 1IHM) (19) as the search model\nand the program Phaser (16); the molecular replacement solution had a Z score\nof 10.40 and an log likelihood gain of 72.12 (16). Residues that differ between the\nNorwalk virus capsid and the VA387 P protein were then replaced according to\nthe VA387 amino acid sequence, and manual adjustments were carried out with\nthe program O (11) guided by the difference electron density maps expressed\nby the following equations: (2Fo \u0005 Fc) and (Fo \u0005 Fc), where Fo is the observed\nstructure factor and Fc is the calculated structure factor. Multiple cycles of\nrebuilding and re\ufb01nement with the programs CNS (3) and O were then carried\nout. At the \ufb01nal stages of re\ufb01nement, a composite omission map was calculated\nto eliminate model bias, and water molecules with good hydrogen-bonding po-\ntentials were located in peaks (\u00072.5\b) of the (Fo \u0005 Fc) map. The upper B factor\nlimit was set to 200 \u00c52 in the re\ufb01nement. Data-processing and structural re\ufb01ne-\nment statistics are summarized in Table 1. The re\ufb01ned structures were evaluated\nwith the program PROCHECK (13); in all three re\ufb01ned structures, a single\nresidue, Asn373, was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot\nin the A-type complex, which appeared to be the result of direct interaction with\na nearby A trisaccharide molecule. The structural analysis was performed mainly\nby using the program EdPDB (29). The radii of both the probe and the solvent\nmolecule were assigned as 1.4 \u00c5.\nProtein Data Bank accession codes. The coordinates and structure factors for\nthe P protein (2OBR), the complex with A trisaccharide (2OBS), and the com-\nplex with B trisaccharide (2OBT) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank,\nResearch Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New\nBrunswick, NJ.\nRESULTS\nStructural overview. The recombinant P protein (i.e., resi-\ndues 214 to 539) of VA387, a Lordsdale-like GII-4 strain of\nnorovirus, was expressed and puri\ufb01ed from E. coli and crystal-\nlized. The native crystal structure was determined at a 2.2-\u00c5\nresolution by using the molecular replacement method. 1t be-\nlongs to the C2221 space group, with 1 protein molecule per\nasymmetric unit and a Matthews coef\ufb01cient (VM) of 2.2 \u00c53/Da\n(\t44% solvent content). Mass spectrometry analysis of the\ncrystal sample indicated that the crystallized protein had a\nmolecular mass of 34.4 kDa, compared with the calculated\n35.9-kDa molecular mass of the recombinant protein. This\nobservation suggested that the protein sample had been slowly\ndigested proteolytically during the crystallization process,\nwhich might be bene\ufb01cial for obtaining the high-quality crystal.\nFurthermore, residues Ala294 to His297, Thr371 to Asn373,\nand Asp391 to Asn393 in three loop regions could not be\nlocated on the electron density map when the P protein was\ncrystallized alone, yet they became well de\ufb01ned when either A\nor B trisaccharide was added. 1n addition, there was no inter-\npretable electron density for residues 531 to 535, indicating a\n\ufb02exible C terminus. The \ufb01nal model of the re\ufb01ned P domain\nmonomer contained residues Thr224 to Gly530, with dimen-\nsions of 44 by 49 by 64 \u00c5.\nSimilar to the Norwalk viral capsid, the P2 subdomain (res-\nidues 275 to 417) of VA387 appears to be an insertion in the P1\nsubdomain (residues 222 to 274 and 418 to 539) between\nGly274 and Ala418 (Fig. 1A and B), which are 4.6 \u00c5 apart as\nmeasured between their C\u0006 atoms. The P1 subdomain has two\ntwisted \u0003-sheets sharing strands \u00031 and \u00038 (Fig. 1B). Both\n\u0003-sheets consist of purely antiparallel \u0003 strands. The smaller\n\u0003-sheet has a strand order of \u00031-\u00038-\u000310, in which the amino\nterminus of \u00031 and the carboxyl terminus of \u00038 participate.\nThe larger \u0003-sheet has a strand order of \u000314-\u00031-\u00038-\u000313-\u000312-\n\u000311-\u000315, in which the carboxyl terminus of \u00031 and the amino\nterminus of \u00038 participate. There is only one well-de\ufb01ned \u0006\nhelix (\u00061, residues 454 to 463) in the entire P domain which is\nin the P1 subdomain and is involved in P domain homodimer-\nization. The two \u0003-sheets and the \u00061 helix plus the amino-\nterminal region (i.e., residues 227 to 237) contribute to the\nhydrophobic core of P1. The P2 subdomain features a six-\nstranded, antiparallel \u0003-barrel of a Greek key topology with a\nstrand order of \u00032-\u00033-\u00036-\u00035-\u00034-\u00037 and a well-packed hydro-\nphobic core. The P1 and P2 subdomains are cushioned by a\nrandom coil-dominated region without a signi\ufb01cant secondary\nstructure (Fig. 1A, left).\nThere are 26 (8.2%) proline residues in each P monomer; 19\nof them are conserved between VA387 and Norwalk virus,\naccounting for 16.4% of all the residues conserved between\nthese strains. 1n comparison, the average frequency of proline\n5950\nCAO ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nresidues in proteins from different species usually ranges be-\ntween 2.1 and 6.5% (27). 1n addition, 36% of backbone car-\nbonyl oxygen atoms and 24% of backbone amide groups in the\n\ufb01nal model hydrogen bond with crystallographically localized\nwater molecules (i.e., operationally de\ufb01ned as those within 3.3\n\u00c5) to satisfy their hydrogen bond potential. The high proline\nfrequency in the P domain and the extensive interactions of\nthis domain with water molecules may partially contribute to\nits stability at the low secondary-structure content (3% \u0006 he-\nlices and 29% \u0003 strands).\nP domain dimer. The P domain of VA387 forms a ho-\nmodimer with dimensions of 57 by 63 by 69 \u00c5. 1t comprises two\nasymmetric units related by the crystallographic two-fold a\naxis. The P dimer interface is formed mainly between the two\n\u0003-barrels in the P2 subdomains (between strands \u00035 and \u00039)\nand between the two dyad-related regions surrounding the \u00061\nhelices in the P1 subdomains (Fig. 1A, right). The dimer in-\nterface contains a large buried surface area twisted by \t60\u00b0\nfrom the \u00061-\u00061 region to the \u00035-\u00039 contact regions, which\ngreatly stabilizes the dimer structure.\nThe total area of the solvent-accessible surface (SAS) buried\nfrom each protomer during dimerization is about 1,800 \u00c52.\nThe contribution of nonpolar carbon atoms (52%) to the\ndimerization almost equals that of the polar atoms (48%),\nsuggesting that both hydrophobic and polar interactions are\nimportant to the dimerization.

Moreover, a total of 72 water molecules (36\nindependent molecules corresponding to each protomer) were\nfound in the P dimer interface (i.e., less than 6 \u00c5 from both P\ndomain protomers and with more than 70% of the SAS buried\nby the P dimer). Cleary, water molecules play critical roles in\nstabilizing the P domain dimerization.\nAlong the dyad axis, we can divide the dimer interface into\nfour layers (Fig. 1C). The top layer has a hydrophobic center\nand two hydrogen bond-rich regions. The hydrophobic center\nis formed by side chains of Met333, Lys348, Thr384, and\nVal386, and each hydrogen bond-rich region is formed by four\nintermolecular hydrogen bonds between \ufb01ve residues: Thr344\nN-Gly442 O (2.86 \u00c5), Thr344 O\u000b-Ser441 N (2.90 \u00c5), Thr344\nO\u000b-Gly442 O (2.92 \u00c5), and Ala346 N-Cys440 O (3.17 \u00c5).\nAround Arg345, there is an open cavity accessible to the re-\nceptor ligands with a size of about 10 by 8 by 4 \u00c5 (see below).\nThe remaining three layers are a water tumel, a hydrophobic\nlayer (residues Pro243, Pro245, Ala280, and Val281), and a\nmixed hydrophilic center with two hydrophobic edges. 1nside\nthe symmetrical water tumel in the dimer interface perpen-\ndicular to the dyad axis, with Glu274, Trp308, Thr337, and\nThr436 forming the entrance, about 20 transiently located wa-\nter molecules form a nearly continuous hydrogen-bonding net-\nwork with the surrounding amino acid residues. The hydro-\nphilic center of the fourth layer is formed by side chains of\nSer238, Ser279, Glu455, Gln458, His459, and Glu463 as well as\na number of buried water molecules, and each of the two\nhydrophobic edges is formed by 1le231, Leu232, and Leu278.\nP domain-trisaccharide complex. The crystal forms of the P\nprotein in complex with either the A or B trisaccharide\n(Fig. 2A and B) had an improved resolution (2.0 \u00c5) and were\notherwise isomorphous to that of the P domain in the absence\nof an oligosaccharide. The fucose (\u0006-Fuc) and galactose (\u0003-\nGal) rings shared by the A and B trisaccharides were clearly\nvisible at the \u00012.8\b contour level in [FO(complex) \u0005 FO(native)]\ndifference electron density maps phased with the protein\nmodel alone. All three saccharide rings in the trisaccharides\nwere modeled as chair conformations. Between the two trisac-\ncharides, the B trisaccharide was better de\ufb01ned in the electron\ndensity map (Fig. 2C), and the results presented below are\nbased mainly on data from the B-type complex. 1t is pertinent\nto note, however, that the overall ligand binding modes were\nalmost identical between the two complex crystals; there were\nno signi\ufb01cant features (at \f2.8\b levels) in an [FO(A complex) \u0005\nFO(B complex)] difference electron density map.\nBoth A and B trisaccharides interacted with the P protein\nstrongly between the fucose ring and the open cavity formed by\nthe \u00035 strand, which protruded from the \u0003-barrel, and nearby\nresidues, including Ser343, Thr344, Arg345, and Asp374 in one\nprotomer and Ser441, Gly442, and Tyr443 in the other. Resi-\ndues Thr344, Arg345, and Gly442 were located at the bottom\nof the cavity, while other residues surrounded them (Fig. 3).\nThe fact that both the A and B trisaccharides are located near\nthe P dimer interface indicates that dimerization is not only\nimportant structurally for the P domain but also essential for\nits receptor binding function.\nResidues Asp391 to Asn393 were missing in the native P\ndomain crystal structure but not in those of the complexes. The\nbinding of a trisaccharide introduced a water-bridged hydro-\ngen bond between Asp391 and saccharides; consequently, the\nmobility of the Asp391-Asn393 region was reduced, and the\nresidues became visible in the electron density map. Similarly,\nFIG. 1. Dimer of the VA387 P domain.

VIROL.\n\nin the absence of a ligand, the three residues amino-terminal to\nAsp374 (i.e., Thr371 to Asn373) and four residues (Ala294 to\nHis297) in a neighboring loop were missing. The binding of\nsaccharides also requires the remodeling of the Arg345 side\nchain, making it suitable for interaction with the \u0006-Fuc ring. 1n\nparticular, side chains of Gln336, Thr338, and Ser343 form\nfour hydrogen bonds with the guanidine group of Arg345 in the\ncomplex structure (Fig. 3E), while the Arg345 side chain pro-\ntrudes into the solvent and is highly mobile in the native struc-\nture. A higher level of \ufb02exibility around the binding site in the\nabsence of a ligand may be bene\ufb01cial to some extent for the\nreceptor binding by providing certain interface plasticity to\naccommodate different HBGAs (at a cost of entropy-related\nfree energy of binding).\nThe interface between the P protein and fucose is domi-\nnated by hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3D and Table 2), and as a result\nthe fucose ring is well de\ufb01ned in the electron density map. For\nexample, both the side chain carboxyl oxygen groups of Asp374\nform stable hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups of the fucose\nring: O\u000e1 to O3a (2.67 \u00c5) and O\u000e2 to O2a (2.55 \u00c5); Asp374,\nin turn, is supported by His347 through a side chain hydrogen\nbond (2.85 \u00c5) (Fig. 3E). The backbone O atom of Thr344 and\nthe N\u03b5 atom of the guanidine group of Arg345 also form strong\nhydrogen bonds with the fucose ring: O to O4a (2.62 \u00c5) and N\u03b5\nto O3a (2.82 \u00c5), respectively. 1n addition, there is a potential\n(3.35-\u00c5) hydrogen bond between the Oa atom on the fucose\nring and the backbone amide group of Gly442. The phenol\ngroup of the following Tyr443 exhibits a van der Waals inter-\naction with the methyl group at position 6 of the fucose ring.\nThe middle \u0003-Gal of the trisaccharide was clearly discerned\nin the electron density map. However, the shortest distance\nbetween the \u0003-Gal ring and the P dimer is 6.0 \u00c5, suggesting a\ncertain \ufb02exibility in the mode of binding between the \u0003-Gal\nring of the trisaccharide and the P dimer. 1n contrast, the\nterminal saccharide ring that differs between A (\u0006-GalNAc)\nand B (\u0006-Gal) trisaccharides exhibited weak electron density,\nperhaps due to a lack of constraints from the capsid protein. 1n addition to the observed ligand binding, we found another\nopen pocket nearby the \u0003-Gal ring. 1t is decorated by potential\nhydrogen-bonding donors and acceptors, including the back-\nbone O and side chain N\u03b52 atoms of Gln390, the backbone\namid group and side chain of Asp391, the backbone O atom of\nGly392, and the side chains of Asn393, His395, and Tyr443.\nThe hydroxyl group at position 1 of the \u0003-Gal ring, which\nwould comect to the rest of the ligand, pointed towards this\nopen pocket. We speculate that this pocket interacts with the\nsaccharide ring comecting to the hydroxyl group O1 of \u0003-Gal,\nand such an interaction might signi\ufb01cantly enhance the binding\naf\ufb01nity between the saccharide and the P protein.\nComparison with Norwalk virus. The superposition of the\ncrystal structures of the VA387 P domain and the Norwalk\nvirus capsid yields a root mean square deviation of 1.4 \u00c5 for\n245 residues from a total of 307 and 290 P domain residues for\nVA387 and Norwalk virus, respectively. The most signi\ufb01cant\nvariations in the backbones occur in the P2 subdomains, in-\ncluding the regions from His292 to 1le300, Thr337 to Thr344,\nand Thr368 to Leu375 of VA387 (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, a\nstructure-based amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. 4B)\nshows an overall identity of 37%, with 46% identity in the P1\nsubdomain but only 24% identity in the P2 subdomain between\nthe two viruses. 1n VA387, small insertions of residues Val290\nto Gly295, Thr337 to Glu340, and Thr369 to Asn373 compared\nto the Norwalk virus sequence appear to be responsible for the\ndifferent conformations in the above-mentioned regions. No-\ntably, all three insertions are located in the turns of three \u0003\nstrand pairs, \u00032-\u00033, \u00034-\u00035, and \u00036-\u00037, respectively, and at the\nsame end of the \u0003-barrel. They form a highly variable interface\nbetween the virus and the saccharide ligands. 1n addition, a\nthree-residue (Pro-Asn-Met) insertion between Try443 and\nAsn447 in VA387 makes the corresponding loop between \u00039\nFIG. 2.

Surprisingly, none of the VA387 residues interacting\nwith the ligand trisaccharides (Table 2) are conserved in Nor-\nwalk virus, suggesting that different receptor binding modes\nmay be used by the two viruses.\nDISCUSSION\nThe human histo-blood group antigens have been identi\ufb01ed\nas the norovirus receptors (5), and previous work on the struc-\nture of the Norwalk virus capsid has illustrated the domain\norganization of the VP1 protein (19). Nevertheless, conven-\ntional sequence-based homology modeling can provide only\nlimited information on the receptor binding patterns of noro-\nviruses because of the wide genetic diversity among norovirus\nsequences, which tend to undergo saturated substitution, in-\nsertions and deletions, and homologous recombination (21).\nTherefore, experimental, structural studies of receptor-virus\ncomplexes and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis are es-\nsential for our understanding of the speci\ufb01city and mechanism\nof the host-virus interaction. 1n the present work, we report the crystal structure of the\nVA387 P domain in complex with HBGA-related trisaccha-\nrides at 2.0-\u00c5 resolution, and a number of features of the P\nprotein that are associated with viral capsid assembly and re-\nceptor binding are described.

Numbers in parentheses are\nthe corresponding B factors (\u00c52). Residues marked with primes are from the\nsecond P dimer protomer. 1n addition, there is one hydrogen bond between the\ntrisaccharide and a nondimer neighboring P dimer molecule (Trp519 O6b-N\n\u00132.85 \u00c5\u0014). Solvent molecules (Sol) were numbered according to the Protein Data\nBank \ufb01le 2OBT.\n5954\nCAO ET AL.\nJ. VIROL.\n\nthe \u00061 helix surface as well as their neighboring residues and\nthe two dyad-symmetrical, close-contact regions between \u00035\nand \u00039 form a triangular interaction network. Based on statis-\ntics on protein crystal contacts (8), this dimer interface is likely\nalso to stabilize the homodimerization of the protein in solu-\ntion, con\ufb01rming the previous observations that norovirus P\nprotein spontaneously forms stable dimers when expressed in\nvitro (23, 26).\nTwo identical, independent receptor binding sites per P\ndimer are identi\ufb01ed at the outermost region of the P2 subdo-\nmain, each of which is contributed by both P protomers. The\ndistance between the centers of the two sites is 24 \u00c5. Among\nthe three sugars of the trisaccharides, \u0006-Fuc has the most\nextensive interaction with the P protein, consistent with the\nfact that this \u0006-Fuc is shared by all secretor antigens (A, B, and\nH) (25). This interaction belongs to a typical mode of \ufb02at\nbinding between saccharide and protein, as described previ-\nously (22), in which the saccharide ring lies \ufb02at on one side on\nthe protein surface while the other side of the ring faces the\nsolvent. Strikingly, we did not observe ligand binding in a\npreviously predicted pocket which is at the waist of the P dimer\nand fairly conserved among noroviruses (24). At this time, we\ncamot rule out the existence of other receptor binding sites in\nthe VA387 P dimer for the A and B or other saccharides. Such\nsites may have lower af\ufb01nity or may have been prohibited by\nthe crystal packing and were thus not observed in our complex\ncrystals. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that such an additional\nbinding site could have much higher af\ufb01nity than that observed\nin our complex crystal; otherwise, it might have prohibited\ncrystallization into our present crystal form.\nThe characteristic terminal groups for A (\u0006-GalNAc) and B\n(\u0006-Gal) trisaccharides (Fig. 2) contribute little to the binding\nwith the P dimer in their corresponding complex crystal struc-\ntures. This observation is consistent with results from a previ-\nous in vitro study, using saliva samples and synthetic oligosac-\ncharides, showing that A and B antigens have similar binding\naf\ufb01nities to the VA387 norovirus (23). 1n addition, we were\nunable to cocrystallize the P domain with H trisaccharide\n[\u0006-Fuc-(132)-\u0003-Gal-(134)-GlcNAc; Sigma] (data not shown). 1n contrast to A and B trisaccharides, the H trisaccharide\npossesses a GlcNAc ring at position 1 of \u0003-Gal but contains no\nsaccharide comected to position 3 of \u0003-Gal. Crystal-packing\nanalysis suggests that the GlcNAc unit should not prevent\ncocrystallization. Therefore, it appears that the absence of\n\u0006-GalNAc or \u0006-Gal in the H trisaccharide somehow reduces\nthe af\ufb01nity for the VA387 P domain, consistent with the in vitro\nbinding results obtained using saliva (23). The \ufb01ndings of pre-\nvious nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic studies\nsuggest that the conformation of the B trisaccharide is more\nrigid in general (17). 1nterestingly, in our case, the conforma-\ntions of both \u0006-Fuc and \u0003-Gal of the B trisaccharide were well\nde\ufb01ned in the electron density map and were very similar to\ntheir counterparts in the H trisaccharide in a previously de-\nscribed complex with N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase (14).\nBased the results of previous and present studies, the rec-\nognition of norovirus by HBGAs may occur at two levels. The\n\ufb01rst level is strain speci\ufb01c, in which a hydrogen-bonding net-\nwork is formed between saccharides and residues equivalent to\nThr344, Arg345, Asp374, and Gly442 of VA387. 1t has been\nshown previously that a Thr338-to-Ala mutation in VA387\nabolishes the binding with HBGAs of all A, B, and O types\n(24). Consistently, our complex structure illustrates that\nThr338 forms two hydrogen bonds with the guanidine group of\nFIG. 4. Comparison of the P domains of VA387 and Norwalk virus.

As an\nalmost universal feature associated with viruses (28), both the\nnative HBGAs on the cell surface and the viral capsid are\nmultivalent, which may result in a super network at both levels\nof interactions and a high af\ufb01nity between the host cell and the\nvirus. 1n addition, parts of the glycan chains other than the\nterminal region of the HBGA may stabilize the overall inter-\naction through multiple contacts. 1t has been noted previously\nthat synthetic oligosaccharides conjugated to different back-\nbones (e.g., bovine serum albumin [23] and polyphenylacety-\nlene) reveal signi\ufb01cantly higher af\ufb01nities than free saccharides\n(M. Tan and X. Jiang, unpublished data), suggesting that the\nbackbones of HBGAs may similarly be involved in the second\nlevel of interaction. The biological signi\ufb01cance of the second-\nlevel interaction remains to be \ufb01rmly established.\nNorwalk virus and VA387 belong to different genogroups,\nand they are the only two noroviruses with their P domain\nthree-dimensional structures resolved. While they show overall\nstructural similarity, the compositions and structures of the\nreceptor binding interfaces of the two viruses are signi\ufb01cantly\ndifferent. For instance, a three-residue deletion between \u00039\nand \u000310 in the Norwalk virus results in the loss of one side wall\nof the VA387-like open pocket. This variation may shift the\nbinding site away from the dimer interface, although the\ndimerization may still support the receptor binding site. A\nshifted but similar distribution of polar residues and backbone\ngroups on the top surface of the Norwalk virus P dimer has\nbeen identi\ufb01ed as a potential \u0006-Fuc binding site. 1n addition,\nlike Arg345 in VA387, Norwalk virus Gln334 may form the\nbottom of the putative binding pocket and make crucial hy-\ndrogen bonds with the saccharide. 1n addition, VA207 shows the closest genetic relationship to\nVA387 in the P domain among strains that recognize non-\nsecretors as well as A, B, and O secretors. Primary sequence\nalignment shows that although the residue equivalent to\nVA387 Asp374 is missing in VA207, most other residues in-\nvolved in the hydrogen-bonding network with \u0006-Fuc are con-\nserved. The function of Asp374 may be performed by a neigh-\nboring asparagine residue in VA207. A mutagenesis analysis\nwould be necessary to verify the role of such VA207 residues in\nligand binding.\nFurthermore, the crystal structure of VA387 sheds light on\nthe structural bases of the receptor binding pro\ufb01les of other\nnoroviruses, such as Snow Mountain virus, norovirus strain\nMOH, and Hawaii virus (Fig. 5). These strains represent three\nreceptor binding patterns distinct from that of VA387 but\nshare the ability to bind to the B oligosaccharide chain and do\nnot bind to nonsecretors (Lea, an antigen without \u0006-Fuc linked\nto \u0003-Gal) (6). Their residues corresponding to Arg345 and\nAsp374 of VA387 are conserved and form direct hydrogen\nbonds with \u0006-Fuc. Moreover, the residues Gln336 and His347,\nwhich stabilize Arg345 and Asp374 in VA387, respectively, are\nalso conserved. All of these points suggest that the three strains\nhave receptor binding modes similar to that of VA387 at the\n\u0006-Fuc binding site.\nA full understanding of the antigen-virus recognition system\nwould provide a fundamental road map for the future devel-\nopment of novel pharmaceutical interventions to prevent and\ntreat norovirus-associated diseases. 1n particular, structural\nanalyses of P domain-trisaccharide complexes will be helpful in\nthe design of small-molecule reagents that exclusively interact\nwith norovirus. Furthermore, such studies would stimulate re-\nsearch on other HBGA-related pathogens.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Zhijie Liu, Neil Shaw, and Mark Bartlam for technical\ninstructions and helpful discussions.

These organisms were found to be moderately susceptible or resistant by broth\nmacrodilution and agar dilution methods. This discrepancy indicates that the FOX panel is not reliable for\nsusceptibility testing of S. pneumoniae.\nScreening of isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae for\npenicillin resistance with a 1-,ug oxacillin disk has been\nrecommended for many years (6). This procedure, however,\ndoes not distinguish between relatively resistant (MICs, 0.12\nto 1.0 ,ug/ml) and resistant (MICs > 1.0 ,ug/ml) pneumococci.\nThe distinction between relatively resistant and resistant\npneumococci has clinical importance in the treatment of\npneumococcal meningitis and possibly bacteremia. Rela-\ntively resistant strains may respond to higher doses of\npenicillin or other P-lactam antibiotics, whereas vancomycin\nis recommended for isolates for which penicillin MICs are\n.2.0 ,ug/ml (2). When the oxacillin screen indicates de-\ncreased susceptibility to penicillin, our policy has been to\ndetermine the MIC by using a commercial microdilution\nsystem, FOX panel (Micro Media Systems, Cleveland,\nOhio).\nRecently, we have observed a major discrepancy between\nthe oxacillin screen results and the MIC as determined by\nthe FOX microdilution panel among 12 clinical isolates of\npneumococci sent to our laboratory for susceptibility deter-\nminations. All 12 isolates were found to be resistant by the\noxacillin screen (zone size s 19 mm) but were susceptible by\nthe FOX panel (MIC s 0.06 ,ug/ml).\nFalse susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to penicillin G by\nusing another commercial microdilution system (American\nMicro Scan, Campbell, Calif.) has been reported by Shan-\nholtzer and Peterson (5). Now we report similar problems\nwith a second commercial microdilution system and com-\npare that system (FOX panel) with the oxacillin screen,\nbroth macrodilution MIC, and agar dilution MIC methods\nfor the determination of S. pneumoniae susceptibility.\nAll S. pneumoniae strains were fresh clinical isolates\nsubmitted to our laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility\ntesting. Twelve isolates were tested. One was from cerebro-\nspinal fluid and one was from an eye, and the remainder were\nblood isolates. After evaluation for oxacillin susceptibility\nand MIC determination with the FOX panel, nine isolates\nwere kept frozen at -70\u00b0C and subcultured twice onto\nColumbia sheep blood agar plates (Remel, Lenexa, Kans.)\nbefore use. Freezing and subculturing did not alter results.\nThree isolates were tested following subculture and 24 h of\nincubation. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, for which\nthe penicillin MIC is known (0.25 to 1.0 ,ug/ml), was used as\n* Corresponding author.\na quality control organism for all susceptibility testing. Also\nincluded in the evaluation was a known penicillin-suscepti-\nble strain of S. pneumoniae (ATCC 6303). All tests were\nduplicated by two technologists working independently.\nA bottle containing 75 ml of Mueller-Hinton agar (BBL,\nBecton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) was boiled and al-\nlowed to cool to 56\u00b0C in a water bath. A 3.75-ml sample of\nsheep erythrocytes (5%) was added to the cooled agar,\npoured into a petri dish (150 by 15 mm), and allowed to\nsolidify on a level bench top. The plate was then dried in a\n35\u00b0C ambient-air incubator for 3 h. The plates were inocu-\nlated in accordance with the National Committee for Clinical\nLaboratory Standards (NCCLS) procedure and then incu-\nbated aerobically at 33 to 35\u00b0C for 18 to 24 h. Zone diameters\nwere measured with a caliper. 1nterpretation was made\naccording to NCCLS (3) recommendations and those of\nSwenson et al. (6).\nThe MICs for\nall isolates were determined by three\nmethods, i.e., FOX Fastidious panel, broth tube macrodilu-\ntion, and agar dilution. All MIC test mixtures were incubated\naerobically at 33 to 35\u00b0C for a full 24 h. With the exception of\nthe FOX Fastidious MIC panel, interpretation of results\nfollowed NCCLS guidelines.\nThe FOX Fastidious MIC panels were received and kept\nfrozen until used. The panels were inoculated according to\nthe procedure outlined in the package insert. MIC results\nwere read with the aid of a plate viewer (Esteem; Micro\nMedia Systems) and were interpreted according to the FOX\nFastidious MIC interpretation guidelines, i.e. s0.06 ,ug/ml,\nsusceptible; 0.12 to 1.0 ,ug/ml, moderately susceptible; and\n.1.0 ,ug/ml, resistant.\nFor the macrodilution MIC, lysed horse erythrocytes\n(LHB) were added to cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton\nbroth (CSMHB) to achieve a final concentration of 3% as\noutlined by NCCLS (4). Twofold serial tube dilutions of\npenicillin G were made in CSMHB-LHB (100 to 0.025\n,ug/ml). A 0.5 McFarland standard was prepared from an\novernight growth on a sheep blood agar plate, further diluted\nto 1:200 in CSMHB-LHB, and then added (0.5 ml) to each\ntube for a final concentration of approximately 5 X\n105\nCFU/ml (total volume, 1.0 ml).\nFor the agar dilution MIC, Mueller-Hinton agar (BBL)\nwas supplemented with 5% sheep blood and penicillin G in\nconcentrations ranging from 0.012 to 0.8 ,ug/ml in doubling\ndilutions. An antibiotic free plate was used as a growth\ncontrol. The plates were inoculated with 0.001 ,ul of 1:100\n2651\n\nJ. CLIN. MICROBIOL.\nTABLE 1.

Zone sizes ranged from 6 to\n17 mm. Of the 12 isolates, 11 were found to be susceptible by\nthe FOX panel. Although strain 5 had an MIC of 0.25 ,ug/ml\nby the FOX panel, this was considerably lower than the\nbroth and agar dilution MICs (2.0 ,ug/ml and 1.0 ,ug/ml,\nrespectively). There was excellent correlation between the\noxacillin screen and the broth macrodilution MIC. 1n con-\ntrast, the agar dilution MICs were susceptible for isolates 1\nand 9. 1n addition, upon repeat testing there was more\nint\u00e9rtechnologist variation with the agar dilution than with\nthe broth macrodilution method for several of the isolates. 1t is unclear why the FOX panel yielded results discrepant\nwith those obtained with the oxacillin screen. One explana-\ntion may be that these particular strains may be more\nfastidious than most, although growth in the control wells\nwas good at 24 h for all isolates. The smaller inoculum\nrecommended, 2.6 x 105 CFU/ml, may also be a factor,\nalthough Shanholtzer and Peterson did not find this to be a\nmajor factor with the Microscan microtiter system\n(5).\nFinally, the undisclosed commercial broth formulation itself\nmay not be supportive of certain strains.\nOur results indicate that the FOX Fastidious panel is not\nan acceptable method for determining susceptibility of S.\npneumoniae to penicillin G. 1n view of our results and\nprevious literature, caution should be used when commercial\nmicrotiteffsystems are implemented for testing pneumococ-\ncal isolates. A recent multicenter study (1) revealed good\nreproducibility among several laboratories when a microtiter\nsystem with Haemophilus test media was used. However,\nthe authors of that report caution that the breakpoints may\nn\u00e9ed to be redefined with this system. Until more data\nregarding microtiter systems are available, we have adopted\nthe following procedure. AHl clinical isolates of S. pneumo-\nniae are screen-ed for decreased\nsusceptibility with the\nKirby-Bauer 1-,ug oxacillin disk. Clinically significant iso-\nlates with zone sizes of <20 mm are further tested by the\nbroth macrodilution method which, in our laboratory, ap-\npears more reliable than the agar dilution MIC method.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Now we report similar problems\nwith a second commercial microdilution system and com-\npare that system (FOX panel) with the oxacillin screen,\nbroth macrodilution MIC, and agar dilution MIC methods\nfor the determination of S. pneumoniae susceptibility.\nAll S. pneumoniae strains were fresh clinical isolates\nsubmitted to our laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility\ntesting. Twelve isolates were tested. One was from cerebro-\nspinal fluid and one was from an eye, and the remainder were\nblood isolates. After evaluation for oxacillin susceptibility\nand MIC determination with the FOX panel, nine isolates\nwere kept frozen at -70\u00b0C and subcultured twice onto\nColumbia sheep blood agar plates (Remel, Lenexa, Kans.)\nbefore use. Freezing and subculturing did not alter results.\nThree isolates were tested following subculture and 24 h of\nincubation. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, for which\nthe penicillin MIC is known (0.25 to 1.0 ,ug/ml), was used as\n* Corresponding author.\na quality control organism for all susceptibility testing. Also\nincluded in the evaluation was a known penicillin-suscepti-\nble strain of S. pneumoniae (ATCC 6303). All tests were\nduplicated by two technologists working independently.\nA bottle containing 75 ml of Mueller-Hinton agar (BBL,\nBecton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) was boiled and al-\nlowed to cool to 56\u00b0C in a water bath. A 3.75-ml sample of\nsheep erythrocytes (5%) was added to the cooled agar,\npoured into a petri dish (150 by 15 mm), and allowed to\nsolidify on a level bench top. The plate was then dried in a\n35\u00b0C ambient-air incubator for 3 h. The plates were inocu-\nlated in accordance with the National Committee for Clinical\nLaboratory Standards (NCCLS) procedure and then incu-\nbated aerobically at 33 to 35\u00b0C for 18 to 24 h. Zone diameters\nwere measured with a caliper.\nInterpretation was made\naccording to NCCLS (3) recommendations and those of\nSwenson et al. (6).\nThe MICs for\nall isolates were determined by three\nmethods, i.e., FOX Fastidious panel, broth tube macrodilu-\ntion, and agar dilution. All MIC test mixtures were incubated\naerobically at 33 to 35\u00b0C for a full 24 h. With the exception of\nthe FOX Fastidious MIC panel, interpretation of results\nfollowed NCCLS guidelines.\nThe FOX Fastidious MIC panels were received and kept\nfrozen until used. The panels were inoculated according to\nthe procedure outlined in the package insert. MIC results\nwere read with the aid of a plate viewer (Esteem; Micro\nMedia Systems) and were interpreted according to the FOX\nFastidious MIC interpretation guidelines, i.e. s0.06 ,ug/ml,\nsusceptible; 0.12 to 1.0 ,ug/ml, moderately susceptible; and\n.1.0 ,ug/ml, resistant.\nFor the macrodilution MIC, lysed horse erythrocytes\n(LHB) were added to cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton\nbroth (CSMHB) to achieve a final concentration of 3% as\noutlined by NCCLS (4). Twofold serial tube dilutions of\npenicillin G were made in CSMHB-LHB (100 to 0.025\n,ug/ml). A 0.5 McFarland standard was prepared from an\novernight growth on a sheep blood agar plate, further diluted\nto 1:200 in CSMHB-LHB, and then added (0.5 ml) to each\ntube for a final concentration of approximately 5 X\n105\nCFU/ml (total volume, 1.0 ml).\nFor the agar dilution MIC, Mueller-Hinton agar (BBL)\nwas supplemented with 5% sheep blood and penicillin G in\nconcentrations ranging from 0.012 to 0.8 ,ug/ml in doubling\ndilutions. An antibiotic free plate was used as a growth\ncontrol. The plates were inoculated with 0.001 ,ul of 1:100\n2651\n\nJ. CLIN. MICROBIOL.\nTABLE 1.

A 0.5 McFarland standard was prepared from an\novernight growth on a sheep blood agar plate, further diluted\nto 1:200 in CSMHB-LHB, and then added (0.5 ml) to each\ntube for a final concentration of approximately 5 X\n105\nCFU/ml (total volume, 1.0 ml).\nFor the agar dilution MIC, Mueller-Hinton agar (BBL)\nwas supplemented with 5% sheep blood and penicillin G in\nconcentrations ranging from 0.012 to 0.8 ,ug/ml in doubling\ndilutions. An antibiotic free plate was used as a growth\ncontrol. The plates were inoculated with 0.001 ,ul of 1:100\n2651\n\nJ. CLIN. MICROBIOL.\nTABLE 1.

Zone sizes ranged from 6 to\n17 mm. Of the 12 isolates, 11 were found to be susceptible by\nthe FOX panel. Although strain 5 had an MIC of 0.25 ,ug/ml\nby the FOX panel, this was considerably lower than the\nbroth and agar dilution MICs (2.0 ,ug/ml and 1.0 ,ug/ml,\nrespectively). There was excellent correlation between the\noxacillin screen and the broth macrodilution MIC. 1n con-\ntrast, the agar dilution MICs were susceptible for isolates 1\nand 9. 1n addition, upon repeat testing there was more\nint\u00e9rtechnologist variation with the agar dilution than with\nthe broth macrodilution method for several of the isolates. 1t is unclear why the FOX panel yielded results discrepant\nwith those obtained with the oxacillin screen. One explana-\ntion may be that these particular strains may be more\nfastidious than most, although growth in the control wells\nwas good at 24 h for all isolates. The smaller inoculum\nrecommended, 2.6 x 105 CFU/ml, may also be a factor,\nalthough Shanholtzer and Peterson did not find this to be a\nmajor factor with the Microscan microtiter system\n(5).\nFinally, the undisclosed commercial broth formulation itself\nmay not be supportive of certain strains.\nOur results indicate that the FOX Fastidious panel is not\nan acceptable method for determining susceptibility of S.\npneumoniae to penicillin G. 1n view of our results and\nprevious literature, caution should be used when commercial\nmicrotiteffsystems are implemented for testing pneumococ-\ncal isolates. A recent multicenter study (1) revealed good\nreproducibility among several laboratories when a microtiter\nsystem with Haemophilus test media was used. However,\nthe authors of that report caution that the breakpoints may\nn\u00e9ed to be redefined with this system. Until more data\nregarding microtiter systems are available, we have adopted\nthe following procedure. AHl clinical isolates of S. pneumo-\nniae are screen-ed for decreased\nsusceptibility with the\nKirby-Bauer 1-,ug oxacillin disk. Clinically significant iso-\nlates with zone sizes of <20 mm are further tested by the\nbroth macrodilution method which, in our laboratory, ap-\npears more reliable than the agar dilution MIC method.\nREFERENCES\n1.
